    "<b>Redeem me.</b> Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: We learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who sells himself and his children</b> as slaves <b>to gentiles, he is not redeemed. However, his children are redeemed due to the harm</b> of becoming assimilated among the gentiles, <b>and all the more so here, where there is</b> a concern that leaving him in bondage may lead to his <b>death,</b> he should be redeemed.",
    "<b>The Sages said to Rabbi Ami: This</b> man <b>is a Jewish apostate, as they saw him when he was eating</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses and animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>]. He said to them: Say</b> that <b>he was eating</b> them <b>due to</b> his <b>appetite,</b> not because he is an apostate, but because he was overcome by temptation.",
    "<b>They said to him: But</b> there are <b>times when there are permitted and forbidden</b> foods <b>before him, and he sets aside the permitted</b> food <b>and eats the forbidden</b> food, indicating that it is not temptation alone that causes him to transgress. Once he heard this, Rabbi Ami <b>said to</b> that man: <b>Go,</b> because <b>they do not allow me to redeem you.</b>",
    "The Gemara recounts a related incident: <b>Reish Lakish sold himself to gladiators. He took a bag and a round stone</b> inside of it <b>with him. He said:</b> There is <b>a tradition that</b> on <b>the final day</b> of a captive’s life, before his captors kill him, <b>they do for him anything that he requests of them, so that he would forgive</b> them for the spilling <b>of his blood.</b>",
    "<b>On the final day</b> before they were set to kill him <b>they said to him: What is amenable to you? He said to them: I want to tie you</b> up <b>and have you sit, and I will strike each one of you one and a half</b> times. <b>He tied them</b> up <b>and had each one of them sit. When he struck</b> each of them with <b>one strike</b> with the stone in the bag, the one whom he struck <b>died,</b> because Reish Lakish was of great strength. Reish Lakish <b>gritted his teeth</b> in anger, and <b>said to</b> the one whom he killed, in order to prevent the others from realizing what was happening: <b>Are you laughing at me? You still</b> have <b>half of a strike remaining</b> with <b>me,</b> as I struck you only once. <b>He killed them all,</b> and Reish Lakish escaped his captors.",
    "<b>He left and came</b> back home, and after some time had passed <b>he was sitting, eating, and drinking,</b> without concern for his livelihood. <b>His daughter said to him: You don’t want something to lie upon? He said to her: My daughter, my belly is my pillow,</b> and this is enough for me. <b>When he died he left</b> only <b>a <i>kav</i> of saffron</b> as an inheritance, and even so <b>he recited</b> this verse <b>about himself: “And they leave their wealth for others”</b> (Psalms 49:11), meaning that he was pained that he did not use all of his property. He exhibited his confidence that God would provide his needs by not saving money for the future.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells his field to a gentile must purchase and bring</b> the <b>first fruits from</b> the field that he sold, <b>for the betterment of the world.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba says: Even though a gentile has no</b> capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael to</b> cause the <b>abrogation</b> of the sanctity of the land, thereby removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce, <b>as it is stated: “For the land is Mine”</b> (Leviticus 25:23), which teaches: <b>The sanctity of the land is Mine,</b> and it is not abrogated when the land is sold to a gentile; <b>a gentile does have, however,</b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael</b> to allow him <b>to dig pits, ditches, and caves</b> in the land he has purchased, <b>as it is stated: “The heavens are the heavens of the Lord; but the earth has He given to the children of men”</b> (Psalms 115:16).",
    "<b>And Rabbi Elazar says: Even though a gentile has</b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael to</b> cause the <b>abrogation</b> of the sanctity of the land, removing it <b>from</b> the obligation to <b>tithe</b> its produce, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to tithes: “The tithe of <b>your grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), which teaches that it is only the grain of a Jew that is obligated in tithes <b>and not the grain of a gentile; a gentile does not have, however,</b> the capability of <b>acquisition</b> of land <b>in Eretz Yisrael</b> to allow him <b>to dig pits, ditches, and caves,</b> in the land he has purchased, <b>as it is stated: “The earth is the Lord’s”</b> (Psalms 24:1).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabba and Rabbi Elazar <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>holds</b> that <b>“your grain”</b> teaches that only grain grown in the field of a Jew is obligated in tithes, <b>but not the grain</b> grown in the field <b>of a gentile. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabba, <b>holds</b> that “your grain” is not referring to the produce itself, but rather to <b>your accumulation</b> of the produce <b>into a pile,</b> which obligates the produce in tithes, <b>and not the accumulation</b> of the produce <b>into a pile</b> by <b>a gentile,</b> as Rabba holds that if a gentile harvests and gathers grain, the grain is not obligated in tithes.",
    "<b>Rabba said: From where do I say</b> that a gentile’s acquisition of land in Eretz Yisrael does not cause the abrogation of the sanctity of the land with regard to tithes? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 4:9): With regard to <b>the gleanings</b> left for the poor, <b>and the forgotten</b> sheaves left for the poor, <b>and the produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>], of a gentile,</b> one is <b>obligated to tithe</b> them <b>unless</b> the owner <b>rendered them ownerless.</b>",
    "The Gemara discusses: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that this is referring to the gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <i>pe’a</i> <b>of a Jew, and a gentile collected them</b> and sold them to a Jew, then how could the mishna write: <b>Unless he rendered them ownerless? But they are already ownerless,</b> since gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <i>pe’a</i> are already ownerless, as anyone can take them. <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that the mishna is referring to produce <b>of a gentile,</b> who then separated gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <i>pe’a</i>, and declared them to be ownerless, <b>and a Jew gathered them.</b>",
    "Rabba explains his inference: <b>The reason</b> that this produce is exempt from tithes is specifically <b>because</b> the gentile <b>rendered it ownerless, but</b> if <b>he did not render it ownerless,</b> then it would be <b>obligated</b> in tithes. One can infer from this mishna that the acquisition of land by a gentile does not cause the abrogation of the sanctity of the land with regard to tithes.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, actually</b> it may be that these were gleanings, forgotten sheaves, and <i>pe’a</i> <b>of a Jew, and a gentile collected them. And that which you said: But they are already ownerless,</b> is incorrect. <b>Let it be that he rendered them ownerless with the intent that a Jew</b> would collect them, but <b>did he render them ownerless with the intent that a gentile</b> would collect them? He did not in fact render them ownerless, as he expected only a Jew to collect them. Therefore, if a gentile collects them and sells them to a Jew, the Jew is obligated to tithe them.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If there was <b>a Jew who acquired a field from a gentile before</b> its produce <b>reached a third</b> of its growth, at which point one is obligated to tithe the produce, <b>and he then sold it to</b> the gentile <b>after</b> its produce <b>reached a third</b> of its growth, then the owner is <b>obligated to tithe</b> the produce <b>because</b> the produce <b>already became obligated</b> in tithes when it reached a third of its growth while under Jewish ownership. The Gemara deduces from here: It is only when the produce <b>became obligated</b> in tithes while under Jewish ownership, that <b>yes,</b> the owner is obligated to tithe, but if the produce <b>did not become obligated</b> in tithes while under Jewish ownership, then <b>no,</b> the owner is not obligated to tithe. This teaches that produce that grows while the field is owned by a gentile is exempt from tithes, and a gentile’s acquisition in Eretz Yisrael abrogates the sanctity of the land with regard to tithes.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are not dealing with Eretz Yisrael proper, but with land <b>in Syria, and</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>the conquest of an individual is not called a conquest.</b> Since Syria was conquered in battle by King David, and not by the Jewish people as a whole, it is not bound by all the same <i>halakhot</i> that apply in Eretz Yisrael.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 2:10): If there were <b>a Jew and a gentile who purchased a field in partnership,</b>"
