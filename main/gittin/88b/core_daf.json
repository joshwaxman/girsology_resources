    "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: Learn from</b> this numerical value that <b>soon [<i>mehera</i>] for the Master of the World is eight hundred and fifty-two</b> years, as it is stated in the verse in Deuteronomy: “You will soon [<i>maher</i>] utterly perish.” Since the Jewish people dwelled in Eretz Yisrael for almost this amount of time, it is apparently considered soon.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a bill of divorce</b> that the husband <b>was compelled</b> by the court to write and give his wife, if he was compelled <b>by a Jewish</b> court it is <b>valid, but</b> if he was compelled <b>by gentiles</b> it is <b>invalid. But with regard to gentiles they may beat him</b> at the request of the Jewish court <b>and say to him: Do what the Jews are telling you, and it is a valid</b> divorce.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a bill of divorce</b> that the husband <b>was compelled by a Jewish</b> court to give his wife, if they did so <b>lawfully,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> obligated the husband to divorce his wife, it is <b>valid.</b> This is referring to cases where sexual intercourse is forbidden or specific cases where the Sages instituted that the husband is obligated to divorce his wife. If they did so <b>unlawfully,</b> the bill of divorce is <b>invalid, but</b> it is not considered entirely invalid, as it <b>disqualifies</b> the wife from marrying a priest after her husband’s death.",
    "<b>And</b> in a case where the husband was compelled <b>by gentiles,</b> if he was compelled <b>lawfully,</b> the bill of divorce is <b>invalid, but</b> it also <b>disqualifies</b> the wife from marrying a priest. But if he was compelled <b>unlawfully it does not have even the trace of a bill of divorce,</b> and the wife is not even disqualified from marrying a priest.",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: With regard to the statement that if the husband was compelled by gentiles the divorce is invalid but it also disqualifies the wife from marrying a priest, <b>whichever way you look at it,</b> the statement is difficult. <b>If gentiles are</b> legally <b>capable of compulsion, it should be rendered valid</b> with regard to the woman’s permission to remarry <b>as well. If they are not</b> legally <b>capable of compulsion, it should not disqualify</b> her either.",
    "<b>Rav Mesharshiyya says: By Torah law a bill of divorce</b> that the husband <b>was compelled by gentiles</b> to write and give his wife <b>is valid, and what is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that it is <b>invalid?</b> It is <b>so that each and every woman will not go and depend on a gentile</b> to compel her husband to divorce her through temptation or bribery, <b>and</b> thereby she will <b>release herself from her husband</b> unlawfully.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that where the husband was compelled by gentiles the bill of divorce is valid by Torah law, why did Shmuel rule that if he was compelled <b>unlawfully it does not have even the trace of a bill of divorce? Let</b> a bill of divorce that the husband was compelled <b>unlawfully</b> by gentiles to give his wife <b>be compared to</b> a case where he was compelled unlawfully by <b>Jews, and disqualify</b> the wife from marrying a priest <b>as well.</b>",
    "<b>Rather, that</b> statement <b>of Rav Mesharshiyya,</b> that by Torah law a bill of divorce is valid even if the husband was compelled by gentiles to write it and give it to his wife, <b>is a mistake.</b> In principle it does not have even the trace of a bill of divorce, even if the husband is required by law to divorce his wife.",
    "<b>And what is the reason</b> that the wife is disqualified from marrying a priest in this case? It is because the case where the husband was compelled <b>lawfully</b> by gentiles <b>can be confused with</b> a case where he was compelled <b>lawfully by Jews.</b> If a bill of divorce that gentiles compelled the husband to write and give to his wife carries no weight, people might think that this is likewise the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case where Jews compelled the husband to do so. Therefore, the Sages issued a decree that even if the husband was compelled by gentiles the wife is disqualified from marrying a priest. By contrast, the case where the husband was compelled <b>unlawfully</b> by gentiles <b>cannot be confused with</b> a case where he was compelled <b>lawfully by Jews,</b> as they are too dissimilar. Therefore, a bill of divorce that gentiles unlawfully compelled the husband to write and give his wife is entirely invalid.",
    "§ <b>Abaye found Rav Yosef sitting</b> in court as the judge <b>and compelling</b> husbands to give their wives <b>bills of divorce. He said to him: But aren’t we ordinary people,</b> not ordained judges? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Tarfon would say:</b> With regard to <b>any place where you find gentile courts [<i>agoriot</i>], even if their laws are like Jewish laws, you may not attend them, as it is stated: “Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1). It is derived from here that one may go to court only <b>before them,</b> i.e., Jewish judges, <b>and not before gentiles. Alternatively,</b> it is derived that one may go to court <b>before them,</b> i.e., ordained judges, <b>and not before ordinary people.</b> Since we are not ordained judges, how can you perform a distinctly judicial act?",
    "Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> We see ourselves as agents of the ordained judges in Eretz Yisrael, and <b>we are performing</b> our task as judges on the basis of <b>their agency, just as is</b> the case <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>admissions and loans,</b> which we attend to on the same basis.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why is the <i>halakha</i> that judges living outside Eretz Yisrael do not judge in cases of <b>robbery and</b> personal <b>injury?</b> They should judge in these cases <b>as well.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When we perform</b> our tasks as judges on the basis of <b>their agency,</b> it is <b>with regard to common matters,</b> e.g., cases that pertain to the <i>halakhot</i> of admissions and loans, which arise frequently between people. But <b>with regard to uncommon matters,</b> e.g., cases of robbery or personal injury, <b>we do not perform</b> our tasks as judges on the basis of <b>their agency.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a rumor circulated in the city</b> that an unmarried woman is <b>betrothed, she is</b> considered to be <b>betrothed.</b> Similarly, if a rumor circulated that a married woman is <b>divorced, she is divorced, provided there is no</b> valid alternative <b>explanation [<i>amatla</i>]</b> for the rumor.",
    "<b>What is</b> considered a valid <b>explanation?</b> For example, it is a case where there is a rumor that <b>so-and-so divorced his wife</b> but that the bill of divorce was given to her <b>conditionally.</b> It is therefore possible that the condition was not fulfilled and she is not actually divorced. Similarly, if there is a rumor that a woman was betrothed but that the man <b>threw her betrothal,</b> i.e., the money or document of betrothal, <b>to her,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>closer to her</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>closer to him,</b> and therefore the status of their betrothal is likewise uncertain, <b>this is</b> considered a valid <b>explanation.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement that a woman who is rumored to be divorced is divorced, <b>do we render her forbidden to</b> her <b>husband</b> if she is married to a priest? <b>But didn’t Rav Ashi say</b> that <b>we are not concerned about any rumor that</b> circulates <b>after marriage?</b> Accordingly, a woman should not be compelled to leave her husband merely on the basis of a rumor.",
    "The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If <b>a rumor circulated in the city</b> that a woman is <b>betrothed, she is betrothed,</b> and she may not marry another man until she receives a bill of divorce from the man to whom she is rumored to be betrothed. If she is rumored to have been <b>betrothed</b> to a certain man <b>and</b> subsequently <b>divorced</b> from him,"
