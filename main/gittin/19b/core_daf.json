    "It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav:</b> In the case of <b>witnesses who do not know</b> how <b>to sign, one tears a blank</b> piece of <b>paper for them,</b> and they <b>fill</b> in <b>the gaps</b> with <b>ink.</b>",
    "<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? For bills of divorce. However, for</b> bills <b>of manumission and</b> for <b>all other documents, if</b> the witnesses <b>know</b> how <b>to read and</b> how <b>to sign,</b> then <b>they sign, and if</b> they do <b>not</b> know how to read and sign <b>they do not sign.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>reading, who mentioned anything about it?</b> Why does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel mention the need for witnesses to be able to read when the discussion is about a witness who does not know how to sign? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> In the case of <b>witnesses who do not know</b> how <b>to read, one reads</b> the document <b>in their presence and they sign. And</b> in the case <b>where they do not know</b> how <b>to sign,</b> then one tears paper in the form of a stencil and they fill in the gaps with ink. With regard to this, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? For bills of divorce. However, for</b> bills <b>of manumission and</b> for <b>all other documents, if</b> the witnesses <b>know</b> how <b>to read and</b> how <b>to sign,</b> then <b>they sign, and if not they do not sign.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Elazar says: What is the reason of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who permitted this only for bills of divorce? He holds that there is reason to be lenient with bills of divorce, <b>so that the daughters of Israel should not be deserted.</b> Requiring literate witnesses for bills of divorce could lead to a scenario in which a husband wishes to travel and wants to give his wife a bill of divorce in case he shall not return, but if he does not find literate witnesses he may leave without divorcing her, leaving her unable to remarry.",
    "<b>Rava says: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. And Rav Gamda said in the name of Rava: The <i>halakha</i> is not</b> in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, in accordance with whose</b> opinion is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and it is permitted to do this for any document?",
    "<b>But wasn’t</b> there <b>a certain person who performed an action,</b> and allowed witnesses to trace their names <b>in</b> a case of <b>other documents</b> that were not bills of divorce, and <b>Rav Kahana</b> ordered that <b>he be flogged</b> for doing so? The Gemara answers: Rav Gamda <b>interpreted</b> the statement of Rava only <b>with regard to reading,</b> meaning that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the Rabbis and not Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel only with regard to the question of whether other documents may be read to the witnesses, but not with regard to whether they may sign other documents by means of a stencil.",
    "It is told that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> was nearly blind in his old age. He could barely read and he <b>took great pains</b> to <b>read and sign</b> documents as a witness or a judge. <b>Ulla said to him: It is not necessary for you</b> to do this, <b>as</b> the court scribes <b>would read in the presence of Rabbi Elazar the master,</b> i.e., the halakhic authority <b>of Eretz Yisrael, and he would sign; and the court scribes would read</b> documents <b>before Rav Naḥman and he would sign;</b> and you may do the same. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this was done <b>specifically</b> in a case like that of <b>Rav Naḥman and the court scribes, as they had fear</b> of him because he was a great man and a judge to whom they were subservient. Therefore, there was no concern that they would not read it correctly. <b>However,</b> for <b>Rav Naḥman and other scribes,</b> or <b>the court scribes and another person, no;</b> the document may not be read to the witness, as the scribes may read it incorrectly to him.",
    "The Gemara recounts the behavior of another <i>amora</i> who had documents read to him: <b>When documents</b> that were written in <b>Persian</b> and <b>that were produced in gentile courts came before Rav Pappa,</b> who did not know how to read Persian, he would <b>have it be read by two gentiles, each one not in the presence of the other</b> and in a way that each one would <b>speak offhandedly,</b> without knowing that they were giving testimony. Once he clarified what was written in the document <b>he would collect</b> payment <b>with it</b> even <b>from liened</b> property that had been sold, as he held that such a document is entirely valid with regard to monetary law.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav Huna bar Natan said to me</b> that <b>so said Ameimar:</b> With regard to <b>this Persian document, on which Jews are signed as witnesses,</b> the court is able to <b>collect</b> payment <b>with it,</b> even <b>from liened</b> property that had been sold.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But they don’t know how to read,</b> as most Jews did not read Persian. The Gemara answers: Ameimar’s statement applies <b>when they know</b> how to read Persian. The Gemara questions how the court can rely upon such a document: <b>But don’t we require</b> all legal documents to be written in <b>a writing that cannot be forged; and it is not</b> so in documents produced by Persians, as the Persians were not particular about this when writing their legal documents. The Gemara answers: His statement applies <b>in</b> a case where the paper of the documents was processed <b>with gall.</b> Consequently, it is not possible to forge the writing. <b>But we require</b> a document <b>to recap the</b> essential <b>topic of the document in its last line; and it is not</b> so in the case of Persian documents. The Gemara answers: Ameimar’s statement applies <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> the document <b>recapped</b> the essential topic of the document in the final line.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if Ameimar’s statement applies only when all these conditions are met, then <b>what is he teaching us, that</b> a document that is properly written in <b>any language</b> is <b>valid? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (87b): In the case of <b>a bill of divorce that he wrote</b> in <b>Hebrew and its witnesses</b> signed in <b>Greek,</b> or one that he wrote in <b>Greek and its witnesses</b> signed in <b>Hebrew,</b> it is <b>valid.</b> If this is written in the mishna, Ameimar’s statement would not simply repeat it.",
    "The Gemara answers: This cannot serve as a clear proof, because <b>if</b> the only source for this <i>halakha</i> were <b>from that</b> mishna then <b>I would say: This statement</b> applies only <b>for bills of divorce,</b> where the Sages were lenient so that a woman would not be unable to remarry. <b>However, for other documents, no.</b> Consequently, Ameimar <b>teaches us</b> that other types of documents are valid if they are written in other languages as well.",
    "§ <b>Shmuel says:</b> If a man <b>gave</b> his wife <b>a blank</b> piece of <b>paper and said to her: This is hereby your bill of divorce,</b> then <b>she is divorced.</b> Why? <b>We are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he wrote it with gall water,</b> rendering it a valid bill of divorce, and the writing was subsequently absorbed into the paper so that it was no longer visible.",
    "<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:2): If a husband said to his wife: <b>This is hereby your bill of divorce, and</b> instead of opening it and looking at it <b>she took it and threw it into the sea, or into a fire, or into anything that destroys</b> it; <b>and he later said:</b> It wasn’t actually a bill of divorce, rather <b>it is a document of appeasement</b> [<b><i>shetar passim</i></b>], a symbolic promissory note meant only for display so that the person holding it will be considered to be wealthy; or he said: <b>It is a document of trust,</b> which is a false promissory note given by one person to another, trusting that he will not make use of it until there has been an actual loan; then <b>she is divorced. And he does not have</b> the power <b>to make her forbidden</b> to everyone else as a married woman by saying that it was not a bill of divorce and they are still married.",
    "The Gemara makes an inference from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The reason</b> she is divorced is because this bill of divorce <b>has writing,</b> and there is no way to ascertain what was written, <b>but</b> if it did <b>not</b> have <b>writing,</b> then <b>no,</b> there is no concern that perhaps it was a valid bill of divorce written with gall water. This runs counter to the statement of Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>When Shmuel said</b> that the woman was divorced with a blank piece of paper, it was in a case <b>where we check</b> the paper <b>with a colored liquid</b> [<b><i>maya denara</i></b>]. <b>If</b> the paper <b>expels</b> the writing, then <b>it expels</b> it and it is a valid bill of divorce. <b>And if it does not expel</b> it, then the document <b>is nothing</b> and she is not divorced.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> the paper <b>expels</b> the writing, <b>what of it?</b> It is possible <b>that</b> only <b>now it expels</b> the writing and the letters become visible, but from the beginning there was no legible writing and therefore the document should be considered invalid. The Gemara answers that <b>even Shmuel said</b> only: <b>We are concerned,</b> and he does not hold that it is a valid bill of divorce. Rather, the court takes into account the possibility that what he gave her in the beginning was a valid bill of divorce, and the <i>halakha</i> is that it is uncertain if she is divorced.",
    "<b>Ravina said: Ameimar said to me</b> that <b>so said Mareimar in the name of Rav Dimi: These two</b> witnesses who testify <b>that the bill of divorce was given in their presence are required to read it.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If a man says to a woman: <b>This is hereby your bill of divorce, and</b> instead of opening it and looking at it <b>she took it and threw it into the sea, or into a fire, or into anything that destroys</b> it, <b>and he later said:</b> It wasn’t actually a bill of divorce, but rather, <b>it is a document of appeasement,</b> or <b>it is a document of trust;</b> then <b>she is divorced, and he does not have</b> the power <b>to make her forbidden</b> to everyone else as a married woman by saying that it was not a bill of divorce and they are still married. <b>And if you say</b> that the witnesses <b>need to read</b> the bill of divorce, then <b>is</b> the husband <b>able to say this to her after they read it?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rav Dimi to teach his <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where after they read it,</b> the husband <b>placed it under his arm,</b> and later <b>took it out,</b> and gave it to the woman without it being read again. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>he switched it</b> with another document, and what he gave her was not a bill of divorce but a document of appeasement or trust as he claims, Rav Dimi <b>teaches us</b> that the court need not be concerned that he switched it.",
    "The Gemara tells: There was <b>a certain man who threw</b> what he claimed was <b>a bill of divorce to his wife,</b> into her courtyard, <b>among the barrels,</b> and in the end <b>a <i>mezuza</i> was found</b> there. The question is: Is there a concern that he threw her a bill of divorce, and the bill of divorce was destroyed, and the <i>mezuza</i> happened to be in the same location? Or perhaps he threw her the <i>mezuza</i> and only claimed that it was a bill of divorce. <b>Rav Naḥman said: A <i>mezuza</i> is infrequently</b> placed <b>among the barrels,</b> and it can be assumed that he threw the <i>mezuza</i> and not a bill of divorce.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>when one</b> <i>mezuza</i> <b>was found. However,</b> if <b>two</b> or <b>three</b> <i>mezuzot</i> were found, then the assumption is that <b>as this,</b> the other <i>mezuza</i>, <b>was</b> there, <b>this</b> <i>mezuza</i> <b>was also</b> there before the husband came, <b>and</b> as to <b>the bill of divorce, say</b> that the <b>mice</b> later <b>took it,</b> and the woman was already divorced from the moment it reached her courtyard.",
    "It is told: There was <b>a certain man who entered the synagogue, took a Torah scroll,</b> and <b>gave it to his wife. And he said to her: This is your bill of divorce. Rav Yosef said: For what</b> is there <b>to be concerned for it? If</b> you say that there should be a concern <b>due to gall water,</b> that perhaps he wrote a bill of divorce on the outside of the Torah scroll’s parchment with gall water, and this writing is now invisible, <b>gall water is not</b> permanent when applied <b>on top of gall water.</b> Since parchment for the Torah scroll is processed with gall water, it is not possible to write something with gall water that will remain permanently on the parchment itself. Therefore, there is no concern that he wrote a bill of divorce on the parchment."
