    "<b>That which he decreed against himself,</b> as he undergoes the following: <b>Every day his ashes are gathered, and they judge him, and they burn him, and they scatter him over the seven seas.</b>",
    "Onkelos then <b>went and raised Balaam</b> from the grave <b>through necromancy. He said to him: Who is</b> most <b>important in that world</b> where you are now? Balaam <b>said to him: The Jewish people.</b> Onkelos asked him: <b>Should I</b> then <b>attach</b> myself <b>to them</b> here in this world? Balaam <b>said to him: You shall not seek their peace or their welfare all the days</b> (see Deuteronomy 23:7). Onkelos <b>said to him: What is the punishment of that man,</b> a euphemism for Balaam himself, in the next world? Balaam <b>said to him:</b> He is cooked <b>in boiling semen,</b> as he caused Israel to engage in licentious behavior with the daughters of Moab.",
    "Onkelos then <b>went</b> and <b>raised Jesus the Nazarene</b> from the grave <b>through necromancy.</b> Onkelos <b>said to him: Who is</b> most <b>important in that world</b> where you are now? Jesus <b>said to him: The Jewish people.</b> Onkelos asked him: <b>Should I</b> then <b>attach</b> myself <b>to them</b> in this world? Jesus <b>said to him: Their welfare you shall seek, their misfortune you shall not seek,</b> for <b>anyone who touches them is</b> regarded <b>as if he were touching the apple of his eye</b> (see Zechariah 2:12).",
    "Onkelos <b>said to him: What is the punishment of that man,</b> a euphemism for Jesus himself, in the next world? Jesus <b>said to him:</b> He is punished <b>with boiling excrement. As the Master said: Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to boiling excrement.</b> And this was his sin, as he mocked the words of the Sages. The Gemara comments: <b>Come</b> and <b>see the difference between the sinners of Israel and the prophets of the nations of the world.</b> As Balaam, who was a prophet, wished Israel harm, whereas Jesus the Nazarene, who was a Jewish sinner, sought their well-being.",
    "To conclude the story of Kamtza and bar Kamtza and the destruction of Jerusalem, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i>. It <b>is taught: Rabbi Elazar says: Come and see how great is the power of shame, for the Holy One, Blessed be He, assisted bar Kamtza,</b> who had been humiliated, <b>and</b> due to this humiliation and shame <b>He destroyed His Temple and burned His Sanctuary.</b>",
    "§ It was previously mentioned (55b) that the place known as <b>the King’s Mountain [<i>Tur Malka</i>] was destroyed on account of a rooster and a hen.</b> The details of what happened are as follows: <b>It was customary</b> in that place <b>that when they would lead a bride and groom</b> to their wedding, <b>they would take out a rooster and a hen before them,</b> as if <b>to say</b> in the manner of a good omen: <b>Be fruitful and multiply like chickens.</b>",
    "<b>One day a troop [<i>gunda</i>] of Roman</b> soldiers <b>passed by</b> there while a wedding was taking place <b>and took</b> the rooster and hen <b>from them.</b> The residents of the city <b>fell upon them and beat them.</b> The soldiers <b>came and said to the emperor: The Jews have rebelled against you.</b> The emperor then <b>came against them</b> in war. Among the residents of the King’s Mountain <b>there was a certain man</b> named <b>bar Deroma who could jump</b> the distance of <b>a <i>mil</i>, and he killed</b> many of the Romans, who were powerless to stand up against him. <b>The emperor</b> then <b>took his crown and set it on the ground</b> as a sign of mourning. <b>He said: Master of the Universe, if it is pleasing to You, do not give over that man,</b> a euphemism for himself, <b>and his kingdom into the hands of</b> only <b>one man.</b>",
    "In the end it was the words issuing from <b>his</b> own <b>mouth</b> that <b>caused bar Deroma to stumble, as he uttered</b> this verse in complaint against God: <b>“Have You not rejected us, O God, so that You go not forth, O God, with our hosts?”</b> (Psalms 60:12). The Gemara asks: But did not <b>David also say this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>David uttered</b> these words <b>as a question,</b> wondering whether they were true, whereas bar Deroma pronounced them as a statement of fact.",
    "The Gemara recounts what happened to bar Deroma: <b>He entered an outhouse, a snake came</b> and <b>eviscerated him, and he died.</b> The emperor <b>said: Since a miracle was performed for me,</b> as I had no part in bar Deroma’s death, <b>I will let</b> the rest of the people <b>be this time</b> and take no further action against them. <b>He let them be and went</b> on his way. <b>They leapt</b> about, <b>ate, drank, and lit</b> so many <b>candles</b> in celebration <b>that the image [<i>bilyona</i>]</b> imprinted <b>on a seal [<i>gushpanka</i>] was visible from a distance of a <i>mil</i>.</b> The emperor then <b>said: The Jews are rejoicing over me.</b> So <b>he went back</b> and <b>came against them.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Asi says: Three hundred thousand men with drawn swords entered the King’s Mountain and massacred</b> its inhabitants <b>for three days and three nights. And</b> at the same time <b>on</b> the other <b>side</b> of the mountain, <b>weddings and</b> other <b>festivities</b> continued to be celebrated, <b>and they did not know about each other,</b> owing to the enormous size of the place.",
    "§ Concerning the verse: <b>“The Lord has swallowed up without pity all the habitations of Jacob”</b> (Lamentations 2:2), it is related that <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This</b> is referring to the <b>six hundred thousand cities</b> that <b>King Yannai had in the King’s Mountain.</b> As <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: King Yannai had six hundred thousand cities in the King’s Mountain, and each of them</b> had a population as great <b>as</b> the number of <b>those who left Egypt, except for three</b> of those cities, the population of which <b>was double</b> the number of <b>those who left Egypt.</b>",
    "<b>These</b> are <b>those</b> three cities: <b>Kefar Bish, Kefar Shiḥalayim, and Kefar Dikhrayya.</b> The Gemara explains the meaning of these place-names. <b>Kefar Bish,</b> Evil Town, was called by that name because its inhabitants <b>would not open</b> their <b>houses to guests. Kefar Shiḥalayim</b> was referred to by that name because <b>their livelihood was</b> derived <b>from</b> the cultivation of <b>cress [<i>shaḥalayim</i>].</b> As for <b>Kefar Dikhrayya,</b> Town of Males, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Their women would first give birth to boys, and afterward give birth to girls, and</b> then <b>they would stop</b> having children.",
    "<b>Ulla said: I myself saw that place, and it could not hold even six hundred thousand reeds,</b> all the more so that number of people. <b>A certain heretic said to Rabbi Ḥanina: You lie</b> with your exorbitant exaggerations. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: With regard to</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>it is written: Land of the deer</b> (see Jeremiah 3:19). <b>Just as the skin of a deer cannot hold its flesh,</b> for after the animal is skinned, its hide shrinks, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>Eretz Yisrael, when it is settled, it expands, but when it is not settled, it contracts.</b> This explains how a place that is so small today could have been so highly populated prior to the Temple’s destruction.",
    "§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Minyumi bar Ḥilkiya, Rav Ḥilkiya bar Toviya, and Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya were</b> once <b>sitting together. They said: If there is someone who has heard anything about Kefar Sekhanya of Egypt,</b> which was in that region, <b>let him relate</b> it.",
    "<b>One of them began</b> the discussion <b>and said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a betrothed man and woman</b> from there <b>who were taken captive by gentiles and</b> the latter <b>married them off to each other.</b> The woman <b>said to</b> the man: <b>Please do not touch me, as I do not have a marriage contract from you,</b> and it is prohibited for us to live together without one. <b>And until</b> the day of <b>his death</b> the man <b>did not touch</b> the woman.",
    "<b>And when he died</b> without having touched her, the woman <b>said to</b> the Sages: <b>Eulogize this</b> man <b>who conquered [<i>shepitpet</i>] his passion [<i>beyitzro</i>] more than Joseph. As</b> in the case of <b>Joseph it was only for a short time</b> that he had to overpower his inclination and resist Potiphar’s wife (see Genesis, chapter 39), <b>whereas this</b> man struggled with his passion <b>each and every day.</b> Furthermore, <b>Joseph</b> was <b>not in one bed</b> with Potiphar’s wife, <b>whereas this</b> man was <b>in one bed</b> with his wife. In addition, with <b>Joseph</b> the woman was <b>not his wife, whereas</b> with <b>this</b> man she was <b>his wife,</b> as she was already betrothed to him.",
    "<b>Another</b> Sage <b>began</b> his remarks <b>and said: It once happened that</b> the market price of <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>stood at one dinar.</b> And then <b>the rate went down one <i>se’a</i> [<i>modeya</i>],</b> so that only thirty-nine <i>se’a</i> were sold for a dinar. <b>And they checked</b> to see what sin had caused this, <b>and they found a father and son who had engaged in sexual intercourse with a betrothed young woman on Yom Kippur. They brought</b> the offenders <b>to court and stoned them, and the rate returned to its</b> former <b>level.</b>",
    "Yet <b>another</b> Sage <b>began</b> his remarks <b>and said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> there <b>involving a man who set his eyes upon his wife to divorce her, but her marriage contract was large</b> and he wished to avoid having to pay it. <b>What did he do? He went and invited his friends, gave them food and drink, made them drunk, and lay</b> his friends and his wife <b>in one bed. He</b> then <b>brought the white of an egg,</b> which has the appearance of semen, <b>and placed it</b> on the sheet <b>between them. He</b> then <b>stood witnesses over them</b> so that they could offer testimony, <b>and went to court</b> claiming that his wife had committed adultery.",
    "<b>A certain Elder of the disciples of Shammai the Elder was there, and Bava ben Buta</b> was <b>his name. He said to them: This is</b> the tradition that <b>I received from Shammai the Elder: Egg white</b> on a bedsheet <b>contracts</b> and hardens when heated <b>by fire, whereas semen is absorbed</b> into the sheet <b>by the fire. They checked</b> the matter <b>and found in accordance with his statement</b> that the substance on the sheet was not semen but egg white. <b>They</b> then <b>brought</b> the husband <b>to court, administered lashes to him, and made him pay</b> his wife’s <b>marriage contract</b> in full.",
    "<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: But since</b> those in the city <b>were so righteous, what is the reason that they were punished</b> and destroyed? Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>because they did not mourn for Jerusalem, as it is written: “Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her, rejoice with joy with her, all you that did mourn for her”</b> (Isaiah 66:10). The verse teaches that one who mourns for Jerusalem will rejoice in its rebuilding, and one who fails to mourn for Jerusalem is destroyed.",
    "§ It was stated earlier that the city of <b>Beitar was destroyed on account of a shaft from a carriage.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>it was customary</b> in Beitar that <b>when a boy was born they would plant a cedar</b> tree and when <b>a girl</b> was born they <b>would plant a cypress [<i>tornita</i>]. And when they would</b> later <b>marry</b> each other <b>they would cut</b> down these trees <b>and construct</b> a wedding <b>canopy</b> for them with their branches. <b>One day the emperor’s daughter passed by</b> there and <b>the shaft of the carriage</b> in which she was riding <b>broke.</b> Her attendants <b>chopped down a cedar</b> from among those trees <b>and brought it to her.</b> Owing to the importance that they attached to their custom, the residents of Beitar <b>came</b> and <b>fell upon them and beat them.</b> The attendants <b>came</b> and <b>said to the emperor: The Jews have rebelled against you.</b> The emperor then <b>came against them</b> in war.",
    "It was in connection with the war that ensued that the Sages expounded the following verse: <b>“He has cut off in His fierce anger all the horn of Israel”</b> (Lamentations 2:3). <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: These are the eighty thousand</b> officers bearing <b>battle trumpets</b> in their hands, <b>who entered the city of Beitar when</b> the enemy <b>took it and killed men, women, and children until their blood flowed into the Great Sea. Lest you say</b> that the city <b>was close</b> to the sea, know that <b>it was a <i>mil</i> away.</b>",
    "<b>It is</b> similarly <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: There are two rivers in the Yadayim Valley</b> in that region, <b>one flowing one way and one flowing the other way. And the Sages estimated</b> that in the aftermath of this war these rivers were filled with <b>two parts water to one part blood.</b> Likewise, <b>it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: For seven years the gentiles harvested their vineyards</b> that had been soaked <b>with the blood of Israel without</b> requiring any additional <b>fertilizer.</b>"
