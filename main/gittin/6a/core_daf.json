    "<b>Even</b> if he <b>heard the sound of the quill [<i>kulmusa</i>] and the sound of the scroll</b> when the scribe was writing the bill of divorce for the sake of that woman, this is sufficient.",
    "It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi:</b> With regard to <b>one who brings a bill of divorce from a country overseas, even</b> if <b>he</b> was <b>in the house but the scribe</b> was <b>in the loft</b> writing the bill of divorce, or if <b>he</b> was <b>in the loft and the scribe</b> was <b>in the house</b> writing the bill of divorce, and <b>even</b> if <b>he</b> was <b>entering and exiting the entire day</b> the bill of divorce is <b>valid</b> and he can testify that it was written properly.",
    "The Gemara notes: If <b>he</b> was <b>in the house and the scribe</b> was <b>in the loft, he does not see him</b> at all. <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>baraita</i> is speaking about a case <b>where he heard the sound of the quill and the sound of the scroll?</b> This is a proof which supports the statement of Rav Ashi.",
    "<b>The Master said</b> above, in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Even</b> if <b>he</b> was <b>entering and exiting the entire day,</b> the bill of divorce is <b>valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the one entering and exiting? <b>If we say</b> that this is referring to the <b>agent,</b> who is required to later testify about the bill of divorce, <b>now</b> that in the case where <b>he</b> was <b>in the house and the scribe</b> was <b>in the loft, when</b> the agent <b>does not see</b> the scribe at all and nevertheless <b>you said</b> that the bill of divorce is <b>valid, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that it is valid when <b>he</b> was <b>entering and exiting</b> the place where the bill of divorce was written? <b>Rather,</b> perhaps this is referring to the <b>scribe</b> himself, i.e., he enters and exits all day and does not write the bill of divorce in one uninterrupted act. The Gemara asks: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is obvious,</b> as <b>would we render</b> the bill of divorce <b>invalid</b> merely <b>because he</b> was <b>entering and exiting?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the scribe <b>exited</b> the house <b>to</b> go to <b>the market and returned</b> to continue writing the bill of divorce. <b>Lest you say</b> that perhaps while he was in the market <b>another person found him and told him</b> to write a bill of divorce on his behalf, and he is now writing a bill of divorce for the sake of a woman other than the one for which he was writing it at the outset, the <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this possibility is disregarded and the bill of divorce is valid.",
    "§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed concerning the status of Babylonia with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of bills of divorce: <b>Rav says</b> that <b>Babylonia</b> is considered to be <b>like Eretz Yisrael with regard to bills of divorce, and Shmuel says</b> that it is considered <b>like outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree with regard to this, that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that the reason an agent is required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, is <b>because they are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake, and these</b> Babylonians <b>are learned. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that the reason is <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it, and these</b> Babylonians <b>are also not frequently</b> available.",
    "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>And can you understand it</b> that way? <b>But</b> it was already stated above that <b>Rabba,</b> who says that the concern is whether the document was written for her sake, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the reason is also in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rava,</b> who maintains that witnesses are also required to ratify the bill of divorce. Therefore, even if Babylonians are knowledgeable about writing a bill of divorce for the woman’s sake, Babylonia should be treated like anywhere else outside of Eretz Yisrael because witnesses are not readily available.",
    "<b>Rather, everyone</b> agrees that <b>we require</b> witnesses <b>to ratify it,</b> and they disagree with regard to this: <b>Rav holds</b> that <b>since there are</b> central <b>academies</b> where people study, witnesses <b>are frequently</b> available to ratify bills of divorce. <b>And Shmuel holds</b> that those studying in the <b>academies are preoccupied by their studies;</b> therefore, they cannot be used as witnesses to confirm a bill of divorce, as they will not recognize peoples’ signatures.",
    "<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says: We made ourselves in Babylonia like Eretz Yisrael with regard to bills of divorce, from</b> the time <b>when Rav came to Babylonia.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> from the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: From Rekem eastward</b> is considered to be part of the overseas country, <b>and Rekem</b> itself <b>is like east</b> of Eretz Yisrael. <b>From Ashkelon southward</b> is outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and Ashkelon</b> itself <b>is like south</b> of Eretz Yisrael. <b>From Akko northward</b> is outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>and Akko</b> itself <b>is like north</b> of Eretz Yisrael. Rabbi Yirmeya explains his objection: <b>But Babylonia is situated north of Eretz Yisrael, as it is written</b> with regard to the destruction that will come through Babylonia: <b>“Then the Lord said to me: Out of the north the evil shall break forth”</b> (Jeremiah 1:14).",
    "<b>And we</b> further <b>learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Meir says: Akko is like Eretz Yisrael with regard to bills of divorce, and even Rabbi Meir said</b> this <b>only with regard to Akko, which is close</b> to Eretz Yisrael. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>Babylonia, which is far</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>no,</b> he did not dispute the ruling that it is not considered part of Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised</b> the objection <b>and he resolved it</b> himself: This border of Eretz Yisrael was stated <b>with the exception of Babylonia.</b>",
    "The Gemara inquires: <b>Until where is Babylonia?</b> In other words, what are the boundaries of Babylonia with regard to this issue? <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> Just <b>as</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> concerning the boundaries of Babylonia <b>with regard to lineage</b> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 72a), as Babylonian Jews were considered to have a more prestigious lineage than those of Eretz Yisrael, <b>so</b> is there the same <b>dispute with regard to bills of divorce. And Rav Yosef says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> that is stated there applies only <b>to lineage. However, with regard to bills of divorce, everyone agrees</b> that the boundary of Babylonia is <b>until the second arch of the bridge</b> over the Euphrates River.",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥisda required</b> even those who delivered bills of divorce <b>from Akteisfon to Bei Ardeshir</b> to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence. <b>But</b> for bills of divorce brought <b>from Bei Ardeshir to Akteisfon he did not require</b> this declaration. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>he holds</b> that the reason an agent is required to say that it was written and it was signed in his presence, is <b>because they are not experts</b> in writing a bill of divorce <b>for her sake, and these</b> residents of Bei Ardeshir are <b>learned</b> in this matter?",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And can you understand</b> it that way? <b>But Rabba is of</b> the opinion that the reason is also in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rava,</b> that it is necessary to ratify a bill of divorce. <b>Rather, everyone</b> agrees <b>that we require</b> the presence of two witnesses <b>to ratify</b> the document, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>these</b> residents of Bei Ardeshir, <b>since they go to the market there,</b> in Akteisfon, <b>these</b> residents of Akteisfon <b>recognize the signatures of these</b> inhabitants of Bei Ardeshir.",
    "<b>But these</b> residents of Bei Ardeshir <b>do not recognize</b> the signatures <b>of these</b> residents of Akteisfon. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>They are preoccupied by their market</b> business, as they are buying and selling their merchandise, and therefore they are not familiar with the signatures of the residents of Akteisfon.",
    "§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba bar Avuh would require</b> that an agent state the declaration even when transmitting a bill of divorce <b>from</b> one <b>side</b> of the public domain <b>to</b> the other <b>side [<i>me’arsa le’arsa</i>]. Rav Sheshet required</b> that an agent state the declaration even when transmitting a bill of divorce <b>from</b> one <b>group</b> of houses <b>to</b> another <b>group</b> of houses on the same side of the public domain. <b>And Rava required</b> that an agent state the declaration even when transmitting a bill of divorce <b>within the same group</b> of houses.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But Rava is</b> the one <b>who said</b> that the reason an agent must state the declaration is <b>because there are no witnesses available to ratify it,</b> so why would he require the declaration even when transmitting a bill of divorce within the same group of houses? The Gemara explains: Rava issued this decree only with regard to his city of Meḥoza. The reason is that <b>the residents of Meḥoza are different, as they are</b> constantly <b>mobile,</b> and do not stay in one place. Therefore, it is possible that the witnesses who were present when the bill of divorce was written have already moved elsewhere.",
    "<b>Rav Ḥanin relates: Rav Kahana brought a bill of divorce, and I do not know if</b> he brought it <b>from Sura to Neharde’a</b> or <b>if</b> he brought it <b>from Neharde’a to Sura. He came before Rav</b> and <b>said to him: Am I required to say: It was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, or am I not required</b> to state this declaration? Rav <b>said to him: You are not required</b> to do so."
