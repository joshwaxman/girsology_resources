    "<b>everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is valid. And the mishna, which teaches</b> that if <b>he wrote</b> his qualification in the bill of divorce it is invalid, <b>and we established</b> that it is referring only <b>to</b> a case of <b>an exception, but a condition does not render</b> the bill of divorce <b>invalid,</b> does not contradict this <i>baraita</i>. As <b>if you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where the qualification is written <b>before the essential</b> part of the bill of divorce, <b>and</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And if you wish, say</b> that it is referring to a case where the qualification is written <b>after the essential</b> part, <b>and everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>agrees</b> with regard to its ruling.",
    "<b>And Rava said:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis <b>is</b> with regard to a case where the condition is written <b>after the essential</b> part, <b>as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>we issue a decree</b> rendering the bill of divorce invalid <b>due to</b> a case where the condition is written <b>before the essential</b> part, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we do not issue a decree due to</b> a case where it is written <b>before the essential</b> part. <b>But</b> if it is written <b>before the essential</b> part, <b>everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is invalid.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> accordingly, <b>the mishna, which teaches</b> that if <b>he wrote</b> his qualification in the bill of divorce it is invalid, <b>and we established</b> that it is referring only <b>to</b> a case of <b>an exception, but a condition does not render</b> the bill of divorce <b>invalid,</b> does not contradict this <i>baraita</i>. It is referring to a case where he wrote the condition <b>after the essential</b> part, <b>and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that a condition written after the essential part does not render the bill of divorce invalid.",
    "<b>The father of Rabbi Avin taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If one <b>wrote a conditional bill of divorce, everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is invalid.</b> Rabbi Zeira asked him: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is invalid? But don’t they disagree</b> about this?",
    "Rabbi Zeira therefore modified the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with his opinion: <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>everyone agrees</b> that it <b>is valid. And what are the circumstances</b> in which both sides agree that it is valid? It is referring to a case where the condition is written <b>after the essential</b> part of the bill of divorce.",
    "The Gemara counters: <b>Let</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>say</b> an alternative modification of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is invalid,</b> omitting the words: Everyone agrees, <b>and</b> this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> taught him</b> that <b>everyone agrees,</b> which is a conspicuous statement. Although <b>he may</b> conceivably <b>confuse</b> the word <b>valid with invalid, he</b> certainly <b>does not confuse</b> the phrase: <b>It is, with</b> the phrase: <b>Everyone agrees.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Zeira modified the <i>baraita</i> the way he did.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a man says to his wife while handing her a bill of divorce: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man, except to</b> marry <b>my father or to</b> marry <b>your father, to</b> marry <b>my brother or to</b> marry <b>your brother, to</b> marry <b>a slave or to</b> marry <b>a gentile, or to</b> marry <b>anyone</b> to whom <b>she cannot</b> legally become <b>betrothed,</b> the divorce <b>is valid.</b> Since these men cannot betroth her anyway, his qualification is meaningless.",
    "If he says to her: <b>You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man, except</b> for when doing so violates the following: The prohibition against <b>a widow</b> being married <b>to a High Priest;</b> the prohibition against <b>a divorcée or a <i>yevama</i> who performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>]</b> being married <b>to a common priest; a <i>mamzeret</i> or a Gibeonite woman</b> being married <b>to an Israelite</b> man; <b>an Israelite woman</b> being married <b>to a <i>mamzer</i> or to a Gibeonite</b> man; <b>or</b> marrying <b>anyone</b> to whom <b>she can</b> legally become <b>betrothed, even</b> if this betrothal would be <b>a transgression,</b> such as in the aforementioned cases; in all of these cases the divorce <b>is invalid.</b> His statement renders it a partial divorce, as the woman is still not permitted to marry any man who is eligible to betroth her.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The stating of <b>the generalization in the first clause</b> of the mishna: Anyone to whom she cannot legally become betrothed, serves <b>to include the rest of those liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for engaging in sexual intercourse with her, who are not listed explicitly in the mishna. The stating of <b>the generalization in the last clause</b> of the mishna: Anyone to whom she can legally become betrothed, serves <b>to include the rest of those liable by a prohibition</b> for engaging in sexual intercourse with her, <b>such as an Ammonite and a Moabite, a Gibeonite, an Egyptian, and an Edomite</b> (Deuteronomy 23:4, 8–9). Although they are all prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse with her due to a prohibition or a positive mitzva, she can legally become betrothed to them.",
    "§ <b>Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman:</b> If the husband says that she is permitted to marry any man <b>except for a betrothal to</b> so-and-so, who is <b>a minor boy</b> at that time, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>now,</b> since <b>he is in any event not eligible for betrothal,</b> as a minor boy cannot betroth a woman, the husband’s qualification does not prohibit his wife to anyone, and it is a complete act of severance? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since <b>he will reach</b> eligibility for <b>betrothal,</b> is the husband’s qualification considered as prohibiting her to someone to whom betrothal could apply?",
    "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution to this dilemma in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A minor girl can get divorced</b> from her husband even if she was betrothed to him <b>through her father’s betrothal,</b> i.e., her father betrothed her to her husband (see Deuteronomy 22:16).",
    "<b>Why</b> can she? <b>But don’t we need</b> there to be a broad similarity between the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal, as derived from the juxtaposition between the clause: <b>“And she departs,”</b> and the clause: <b>“And becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), which serves as the basis for the comparison of the <i>halakhot</i> of divorce and betrothal? Accordingly, since she will not be eligible to receive her own betrothal until she reaches majority, she should not be able to receive her bill of divorce. <b>Rather,</b> evidently, since <b>she will</b> eventually <b>reach</b> the age of eligibility to receive her own <b>betrothal</b> she is considered essentially eligible for betrothal now as well. <b>Here also,</b> since the minor boy, whom the husband prohibited the wife from marrying, <b>will reach</b> the age of eligibility for <b>betrothal,</b> the divorce is invalid.",
    "Rava raised another dilemma: If the husband says that she is permitted to marry any man <b>except for those who will be born</b> in the future, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>now,</b> since <b>in any event they are not yet born,</b> the qualification is void, as it pertains to people who do not exist? <b>Or perhaps</b> they are considered forbidden to her as <b>they will be born in the future.</b>",
    "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution to your dilemma in the mishna, which states that if the husband says that she is forbidden <b>to</b> marry <b>a slave or to</b> marry <b>a gentile</b> the divorce is valid; <b>if it is so</b> that future situations are taken into account, <b>a slave and a gentile are also likely to convert.</b> Therefore, the husband is prohibiting her from marrying a man whom she might be able to marry in the future, which should render the divorce invalid. Evidently, only the present situation is taken into consideration.",
    "The Gemara rejects this solution: <b>Those</b> people <b>do not stand</b> before the court ready <b>to convert.</b> It is only a possibility that they will convert, as there is no reason to assume that they will do so. By contrast, <b>these</b> people who will be born <b>stand</b> ready <b>to be born.</b> Therefore, this solution cannot be inferred from the mishna.",
    "Rava raised another dilemma: If he permits her to marry any man <b>except for her sister’s husband, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>now,</b> since <b>in any event she is not yet fit for him,</b> as sexual intercourse between them is punishable by <i>karet</i>, the divorce is valid? <b>Or perhaps</b> should it be reasoned that <b>sometimes</b> a woman’s <b>sister dies and she is</b> thereby <b>fit to</b> marry her husband?",
    "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution to your dilemma in the mishna, which states that if the husband says that she is forbidden <b>to</b> marry <b>a slave or to</b> marry <b>a gentile</b> the divorce is valid. And <b>a slave and a gentile are also</b> potentially fit to marry her as they are <b>likely to convert.</b> Evidently, only the current situation is taken into account. The Gemara rejects this; whereas <b>conversion is uncommon, death is common.</b>",
    "Rava raised another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to any man <b>except for your licentiousness,</b> meaning she may get married to any man but she may not engage in sexual intercourse outside of a second marriage, as she is still rendered a married woman in that regard, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Is the divorce valid? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to marriage he did not leave</b> anything <b>out</b> of the divorce, as she is permitted to marry any man, <b>or perhaps he left out</b> part of the divorce <b>with regard to sexual intercourse?</b>",
    "Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You learned</b> the solution in the mishna: If the husband says while handing her the bill of divorce: You are hereby forbidden <b>to my father or to your father,</b> the divorce is valid. <b>And with regard to what</b> action is this stated? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to marriage, are my father and your father eligible for marriage?</b> Her betrothal to them would not take effect. <b>Rather, is it not with regard to</b> them engaging in <b>licentiousness</b> with her? <b>And</b> it may be inferred from the mishna that only if he renders her forbidden <b>to my father or to your father is it not</b> considered as if <b>he left out</b> part of the divorce, rendering the divorce valid; but if he renders her forbidden <b>to</b> engage in licentiousness with <b>another</b> man, it is considered as if <b>he left out</b> part of the divorce, and it will not take effect.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is referring <b>to marriage, where</b> the father <b>transgresses</b> the prohibition <b>and marries</b> her anyway. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to licentiousness cannot be inferred from here.",
    "Rava raised another dilemma: If he says to her that she is permitted to any man <b>except for</b> engaging in <b>intercourse in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to typical</b> sexual intercourse <b>he did not leave out</b> part of the divorce, rendering the divorce valid? <b>Or perhaps</b> from the fact that the expression: <b>“Cohabitations of a woman”</b> (Leviticus 20:13), <b>is written</b> in the plural, it is derived that typical and atypical sexual intercourse have the same status, and accordingly this is considered a partial divorce, and it will not take effect.",
    "The Gemara raises a similar dilemma: If he says to her that she is permitted to marry any man: <b>Except</b> for the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the nullification of your vows,</b> i.e., no man who marries her can nullify her vows other than her ex-husband, who retains his power to do so, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to</b> her ability to enter into <b>marriage, he did not leave out</b> anything from his act of severance? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it derived from that which <b>is written: “Her husband may sustain it, or her husband may nullify it”</b> (Numbers 30:14), that a husband’s power to nullify his wife’s vows is an intrinsic component of being married, and therefore this divorce is not a complete severance?",
    "The Gemara raises another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to marry any man <b>except for your</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., if she marries a priest she will not be able to partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to</b> her ability to enter into <b>marriage, he did not leave out</b> anything from his act of severance? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it derived from that which <b>is written: “The purchase of his money,</b> he may eat of it” (Leviticus 22:11), indicating that a priest’s wife partakes of <i>teruma</i> because she is his acquisition, and that if she is prohibited from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, then his acquisition of her is not complete?",
    "The Gemara raises another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to marry any man <b>except for your inheritance,</b> i.e., her future husband will not be considered her husband with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that <b>with regard to</b> her ability to enter into <b>marriage, he did not leave out</b> anything from his act of severance? <b>Or perhaps</b> since it is derived that a husband inherits from his wife, who is considered his next of kin, from that which <b>is written: “To his kinsman</b> that is next to him of his family <b>and he shall possess it”</b> (Numbers 27:11), then if a husband does not become his wife’s beneficiary, is their marriage not complete?",
    "The Gemara raises another dilemma: If he says to her: You are hereby permitted to marry any man <b>except for your</b> ability to enter <b>betrothal by</b> receiving <b>a document,</b> i.e., if another man betroths her by giving her a document of betrothal, the betrothal will not take effect, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that since one <b>can</b> still <b>betroth her with money or with sexual intercourse,</b> the act of severance is complete? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it derived from the juxtaposition between the clause: <b>“And she departs”</b> and the clause: <b>“And becomes”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:2), that the different ways of <b>becoming</b> a wife <b>are compared to each other,</b> so that the inability to perform one of them renders the severance incomplete?",
    "The Gemara comments: These dilemmas <b>shall</b> all <b>stand</b> unresolved.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The basic,</b> essential, element <b>of a bill of divorce is: You are hereby permitted to</b> marry <b>any man.</b>"
