    "with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of a steward who cares for the estate of orphans: In the case of <b>orphans who came to divide their father’s property, the court appoints a steward</b> [<b><i>apotropos</i></b>] <b>for them, and they select for them,</b> i.e., for each of the orphans, <b>a fine portion.</b> When the orphans <b>have grown up,</b> they <b>can protest</b> the division and demand the redistribution of the property. <b>And Rav Naḥman said his own</b> statement: <b>When they have grown up, they cannot protest, for if so, what advantage</b> does <b>the court have?</b> This demonstrates that Rav Naḥman agrees with the principle of: If so, what advantage does the court have?",
    "The Gemara answers: There is no contradiction between Rav Naḥman’s statement concerning the inheritance of orphans and his statement with regard to rendering a bill of divorce void. <b>There,</b> in the former case, it is in the realm of <b>monetary matters,</b> and the preservation of the court’s honor is more important than the accurate distribution of the property. <b>Here,</b> in the case of divorce, it is in the realm of matters of <b>prohibition,</b> and one would not permit a married woman to remarry in order to strengthen the authority of the court.",
    "§ The Gemara relates: A man named <b>Giddul bar Re’ilai sent a bill of divorce to his wife. The agent went</b> and <b>found that she was sitting and weaving</b> [<b><i>navla</i></b>]. <b>He said to her: This is your bill of divorce. She said to him: At least go</b> away <b>from here now and come tomorrow</b> to give me the bill of divorce. The agent <b>went to</b> Giddul bar Re’ilai <b>and told him</b> what had occurred. Giddul bar Re’ilai <b>opened</b> his mouth <b>and said: Blessed is He Who is good and does good,</b> as he was happy that the bill of divorce was not delivered.",
    "The Sages disagreed with regard to the status of this bill of divorce. <b>Abaye said</b> that he said: <b>Blessed is He Who is good and does good,</b> as he was happy that it was not delivered, <b>but the bill of divorce is not rendered void</b> through this statement. <b>Rava said</b> that he said: <b>Blessed is He Who is good and does good, and the bill of divorce is rendered void.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They disagree in</b> their understanding of <b>disclosure of intent with regard to a bill of divorce,</b> i.e., when the husband demonstrates that he does not desire the bill of divorce to be delivered, but does not render it void explicitly. <b>As Abaye holds: Disclosure of intent with regard to a bill of divorce is not a</b> significant <b>matter</b> and does not render it void, <b>and Rava holds: Disclosure of intent with regard to a bill of divorce is</b> a significant <b>matter,</b> and does render it void.",
    "<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> this <i>halakha</i>? From a case <b>where Rav Sheshet extracted</b> the authorization to write <b>a bill of divorce from a certain man against his will, and</b> that man then <b>said to the witnesses: This</b> is what <b>Rav Sheshet said to you: Let the bill of divorce be rendered void, and Rav Sheshet required him</b> to write <b>another bill of divorce.</b> Evidently, though the man did not explicitly render the bill of divorce void with his statement, but only demonstrated that he did not want the bill of divorce to be given, Rav Sheshet considered the bill of divorce to be rendered void.",
    "<b>And Abaye</b> would respond: <b>Is that to say Rav Sheshet would render void the bills of divorce of</b> other <b>people?</b> Rather, the husband <b>rendered void</b> the bill of divorce himself. <b>And</b> the reason <b>why he told them this,</b> that it was Rav Sheshet’s instructions that the bill of divorce be rendered void, was <b>due to</b> the <b>lashes</b> that he would have received from the court appointees if he said that he was rendering the bill of divorce void against the wishes of Rav Sheshet.",
    "<b>And Abaye said: From where do I say</b> that disclosure of intent with regard to bills of divorce is disregarded? From the case <b>where Rav Yehuda extracted</b> the authorization to write <b>a bill of divorce from the son-in-law of Rabbi Yirmeya Bira’a, and</b> the man <b>rendered</b> the bill of divorce <b>void.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>again extracted</b> the authorization to write a bill of divorce, <b>and</b> the man <b>rendered</b> the bill of divorce <b>void.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>returned</b> and <b>again extracted</b> the authorization to write a bill of divorce <b>against his will, and said to the witnesses: Place</b> pieces of <b>gourd in your ears and write</b> the bill of divorce <b>for him,</b> so that you will not hear if he renders the bill of divorce void again. Abaye states his proof: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>disclosure of intent with regard to bills of divorce is a</b> significant <b>matter,</b> in this case <b>the witnesses see that he is running after them</b> even though they do not hear him, so the bill of divorce should be rendered void.",
    "<b>And Rava</b> would respond: Since they cannot hear him, his intent is not disclosed; <b>this, that he is running after them,</b> does not prove that he wishes to render the bill of divorce void, as it could be <b>that</b> he wishes <b>to say to them: Make haste</b> [<b><i>ashur</i></b>], <b>give her</b> the bill of divorce <b>speedily</b> [<b><i>hayya</i></b>] <b>in order to end the pain of that man,</b> i.e., my pain, that I am divorcing my wife.",
    "<b>And Abaye said</b> further: <b>From where do I say</b> that disclosure of intent with regard to bills of divorce is disregarded? From the case <b>where</b> there was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> the agents with whom he entrusted the bill of divorce: <b>If I do not arrive</b> from now <b>until thirty days</b> have passed, <b>let this be a bill of divorce. He came</b> after thirty days had passed, <b>but was prevented</b> from crossing the river <b>by the ferry</b> that was located on the other side of the river, so he did not arrive within the designated time. <b>He said to</b> the people across the river: <b>See that I have arrived, see that I have arrived, and Shmuel said:</b> It <b>is not considered</b> to be <b>an arrival,</b> even though it is clear that this was his intention, and the bill of divorce is not void.",
    "<b>And Rava</b> said: This case cannot serve as a proof; <b>is that to say</b> that <b>there he desires to render the bill of divorce void? There,</b> in that case, <b>he desires to fulfill his stipulation, and he did not fulfill his condition,</b> as he did not arrive. Therefore, the bill of divorce remains valid.",
    "The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> witnesses when he gave a bill of divorce to his betrothed: <b>If I do not marry</b> her within <b>up to thirty days,</b> then this <b>will be a bill of divorce. When thirty days arrived, he said to them: I took the trouble</b> but I did not succeed in marrying her.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> need we <b>be concerned</b> in the case of this bill of divorce? <b>If</b> we are concerned <b>because</b> he attempted to marry her and there were <b>circumstances beyond his control</b> that prevented him from doing so, isn’t there a principle that <b>unavoidable circumstances</b> have <b>no</b> legal standing <b>with regard to bills of divorce? If</b> the concern is <b>due to disclosure of intent with regard to bills of divorce,</b> and the husband demonstrated that he does not want the bill of divorce to take effect, then <b>this is a dispute of Abaye and Rava,</b> and, as the Gemara explains later, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Abaye.",
    "The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> witnesses: <b>If I do not marry</b> my betrothed <b>by the New Moon of Adar</b> then this <b>will be a bill of divorce. When the New Moon of Adar arrived, he said to them: I said by the New Moon of Nisan. With regard to what</b> need we <b>be concerned? If</b> we are concerned <b>because</b> he attempted to marry her and there were <b>circumstances beyond his control</b> that prevented him from doing so, isn’t there a principle that <b>unavoidable circumstances</b> have <b>no</b> legal standing <b>with regard to bills of divorce? If</b> the concern is <b>due to disclosure of intent</b> with regard to bills of divorce, and the husband demonstrated that he does not want the bill of divorce to take effect, then <b>this is a dispute of Abaye and Rava,</b> and, as the Gemara explains later, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Abaye.",
    "The Gemara states several conclusions: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rav <b>Naḥman,</b> who ruled that one can render a bill of divorce void in the presence of two people. <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rav <b>Naḥman,</b> who ruled that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi in both of his disputes with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel."
