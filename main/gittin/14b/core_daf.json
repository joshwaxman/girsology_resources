    "Rabbi Aḥai <b>said to Rabbi Dostai bar Rabbi Yannai and to Rabbi Yosei bar Keifar: When you come</b> from Neharde’a <b>bring</b> the vessel <b>to me. They went</b> to Neharde’a and the people who were in possession of the vessel <b>gave it to them.</b> After handing over the vessel, those people <b>said to them: Let us perform</b> an act of <b>acquisition with you,</b> so that you will be responsible for the vessel until you reach Rabbi Aḥai. The agents <b>said to them: No;</b> we do not want to do this. <b>They said to them:</b> If so, <b>return</b> the vessel <b>to us,</b> as we do not wish to transfer it in such a manner that we retain responsibility.",
    "<b>Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Yannai, said to them: Yes,</b> I am willing to return it. However, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Keifar said to them: No,</b> as you do not have the right to retract in this situation. <b>They tormented</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Keifar to force him to agree to return the vessel. Rabbi Yosei bar Keifar <b>said to</b> Rabbi Dostai: <b>See,</b> my <b>Master, what</b> they are <b>doing</b> to me. Rabbi Dostai <b>said to them:</b> You are acting <b>well; hit him.</b>",
    "<b>When</b> these <b>two</b> agents <b>came before</b> Rabbi Aḥai, Rabbi Yosei bar Keifar <b>said to him: See,</b> my <b>Master, not only did</b> Rabbi Dostai <b>not support me; rather, he</b> even <b>said to them:</b> You are acting <b>well; hit him.</b> Rabbi Aḥai <b>said to</b> Rabbi Dostai: <b>Why did you do this?</b>",
    "Rabbi Dostai <b>said to him: Those people</b> who were in possession of the vessel, <b>they are</b> the size of <b>a cubit, and their hats were a cubit, and they spoke from their midpoints, and their names were frightening: Arda and Arta and Pili Bereish.</b> If one were to <b>say to them: Restrain</b> this person, <b>they would restrain</b> him. If one were to <b>say</b> to them: <b>Kill</b> him, <b>they would kill. Had they killed Dostai,</b> i.e., me, <b>who would give Yannai,</b> my <b>father,</b> another <b>son like me?</b>",
    "Rabbi Aḥai <b>said to him: Are these people close to the government?</b> Rabbi Dostai <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rabbi Aḥai asked him: <b>Do they have horses and mules that run after them,</b> i.e., do they have servants to perform their bidding? Rabbi Dostai <b>said to them: Yes.</b> Rabbi Aḥai <b>said to him: If so, you acted well,</b> as the situation was entirely out of your control.",
    "§ The Gemara discusses the meaning of the expression: Deliver, in relation to a gift. With regard to one who said to his agent: <b>Deliver one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</b> the agent <b>went and searched</b> for that person <b>but did not find him,</b> as he had died, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: The money <b>should be returned to the sender. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The money should be given <b>to the heirs of the one to whom it was sent.</b>",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree about this, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that in the case of a gift, saying: <b>Deliver, is like</b> saying: <b>Acquire,</b> and consequently the agent took possession of the money on behalf of the one to whom it was sent. Therefore, the heirs inherit this item. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that in the case of a gift, saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire,</b> and therefore the agent must return the money to the sender.",
    "<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel said:</b> No; <b>everyone agrees</b> that in the case of a gift, saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire, and</b> the apparent contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that the agent must return the money to the sender, is dealing <b>with</b> a case where the giver was <b>a healthy person</b> when he issued the instructions. Such a gift is acquired by the recipient only once it reaches his possession, and this recipient died before the gift reached him. Conversely, <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that he should give it to the heirs of the one to whom it was sent, deals <b>with</b> the instructions of a person <b>on his deathbed.</b> Since the gift of a dying person is immediately acquired by the recipient, this recipient acquired it straightaway, and therefore it must be given to his heirs.",
    "<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is possible to say that saying: Deliver, is not like saying: Acquire, and that both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are dealing <b>with</b> a case where the giver was a person <b>on his deathbed.</b> Instead, the difference between the two sources is that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that he should give it to the recipient’s heirs, is referring to a case <b>where the recipient was</b> alive <b>at the time of the giving of the money.</b> Consequently, when the sender gives the money to the agent the recipient immediately acquires it, and his heirs claim it in his stead. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that the agent must return the money to the sender, is referring to a case <b>where the recipient was not</b> alive <b>at the time of the giving of the money,</b> and consequently the agent could not acquire the money on his behalf.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> yet another explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are both dealing <b>with a healthy person</b> who subsequently died. The difference is that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which said that the agent must return the money to the sender, is dealing with a case <b>where the recipient died in the lifetime of the giver,</b> and as he did not acquire the money himself his heirs do not take possession of it either. By contrast, <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that the money should be given to the heirs of the recipient, is dealing with a case <b>where the giver died in the lifetime of the recipient.</b> Once he dies it is a mitzva to fulfill his wishes, and therefore the recipient, and his heirs after him, are entitled to the money.",
    "The Gemara further suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that the issue of whether saying: <b>Deliver, is like</b> saying: <b>Acquire, is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that if one person said to another: <b>Deliver one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and he went and searched for him but did not find him,</b> as he had died, the money <b>should be returned to the sender.</b> If <b>the sender died, Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Ya’akov said:</b> The money <b>should be returned to the heirs of the sender. And some say:</b> It should be given to <b>the heirs of the one to whom it was sent.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov, who said</b> this <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir: It is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead.</b> Therefore the money should be given to the heirs of the one to whom it was sent. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Due to the uncertainty, <b>they should divide</b> it. <b>And here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they said: Whatever the agent wishes to do he may do. Rabbi Shimon HaNasi said:</b> When <b>an incident</b> of this kind occurred <b>under my</b> jurisdiction I inquired into how to proceed, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>said</b> to me: The money <b>should be returned to the heirs of the sender.</b>",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>they disagree about this</b> issue, <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire,</b> and therefore the money should be returned to the sender? <b>And Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Ya’akov also</b> hold that saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire, but</b> they add that <b>even though</b> the sender <b>died, one does not say: It is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead.</b> Consequently, the money is returned to the sender’s heirs. <b>And</b> the Sages in the clause beginning: <b>Some say,</b> claim that saying: <b>Deliver, is like</b> saying: <b>Acquire.</b> Therefore the recipient takes possession of the money immediately, and it is given to his heirs.",
    "And <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi,</b> who <b>said in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov, who said</b> this <b>in the name of Rabbi Meir,</b> also holds that saying: <b>Deliver, is not like</b> saying: <b>Acquire. However,</b> in a case <b>where</b> the sender <b>died we say</b> that <b>it is a mitzva to fulfill the statement of the dead.</b> Therefore, the one hundred dinars should be given to the recipient or his heirs.",
    "<b>And the Rabbis say: They should divide it,</b> because <b>they</b> are <b>uncertain</b> about the <i>halakha</i> in this situation. <b>And</b> the Sages in the clause beginning: <b>Here they said,</b> maintain that in this case <b>the discretion [<i>shuda</i>]</b> of the agent <b>is preferable</b> to an even division between the parties. <b>And Rabbi Shimon HaNasi</b> does not offer an opinion of his own; rather, <b>he came to teach us an incident</b> in which this case was decided in practice.",
    "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No;</b> it is possible that <b>in</b> a case where the giver was <b>a healthy person</b> when he appointed the agent <b>everyone agrees</b> that saying: Deliver, is not like saying: Acquire, <b>and with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a person <b>on his deathbed</b> who sent these one hundred dinars, <b>and they disagree in the dispute between Rabbi Elazar and the Rabbis.</b>",
    "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 156a): With regard to <b>one who divides his property orally, Rabbi Elazar says: Both</b> in the case of <b>a healthy person and</b> that of <b>a dangerously ill person, property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, <b>is acquired by</b> means of <b>money, through a document, or by taking possession. And</b> property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can be acquired only through pulling. And the Rabbis say:</b> If the giver is on his deathbed, then both <b>this</b> property <b>and that</b> property <b>can be acquired through speech,</b> and there is no need for an additional act of acquisition.",
    "<b>They said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: Didn’t <b>an incident</b> of this kind occur <b>with regard to the mother</b> of the family <b>of the sons of Rokhel, who was ill, and she said: Give</b>"
