    "<b>does he</b> find it necessary to <b>borrow and eat?</b> After all, his master provides for him. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to surplus</b> food, i.e., additional food that the slave wants to eat.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasurer <b>say to him: Until now it was enough for you without a surplus; now too it should be enough for you without a surplus.</b> Why do you seek more now? Consequently, the consecration should apply to this surplus as well. The Gemara answers: <b>It is preferable to</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury <b>itself</b> that he work and eat more, <b>so that</b> the value of <b>its slave will be enhanced</b> when he consumes this extra amount, as he will become stronger.",
    "§ It was stated that the slave borrows and eats and afterward <b>performs</b> work <b>and repays</b> the loan. The Gemara asks: But his work <b>immediately becomes consecrated,</b> as his hands have been consecrated. How, then, can he repay this loan? The Gemara answers: The slave performs work <b>of less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>.</b> Anything worth less than one <i>peruta</i> does not become consecrated. Therefore he can collect these small sums and repay his debt little by little.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> that Rav is referring to a case where the master provides sustenance for him. <b>As Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>one who consecrates the hands of his slave, that slave works and eats, as, if</b> the slave does <b>not work</b> for himself, <b>who will work</b> and provide <b>for him?</b> This ruling indicates that Rav maintains that consecration does not apply to the slave’s hands.",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>this</b> earlier <i>halakha</i> that Rav said, that the slave borrows and repays, refers to a situation <b>where</b> his master <b>provides sustenance for him, and</b> this is because in general <b>he cannot</b> say to him: Work for me but I will not sustain you, <b>and this</b> second <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> his master <b>does not provide</b> him with sustenance, and therefore he cannot consecrate the slave’s hands, it <b>is well,</b> as there is no contradiction between the two statements of Rav.",
    "<b>However, if you say</b> that <b>this</b> first <i>halakha</i> is <b>also</b> speaking of a case <b>where</b> his master <b>does not provide</b> sustenance for him, and the consecration is effective because he <b>can</b> say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you, then what is the meaning of the statement: <b>As, if</b> the slave does <b>not work</b> for himself <b>who will work for him?</b> Let <b>whoever desires work for him,</b> i.e., the slave will be compelled to sustain himself from charity, but this is not the master’s concern.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> here that Rav holds that a master <b>cannot</b> say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you? The Gemara comments: Indeed <b>conclude from</b> here that this is the case.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source concerning the same dilemma, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who severs the hand of another’s slave</b> must <b>give</b> compensation for <b>his</b> loss of <b>livelihood,</b> i.e., compensation for the slave’s inability to work as a result of his injury, <b>and</b> the slave’s <b>medical costs to his master. And that slave,</b> who can no longer work, is <b>sustained from charity. Conclude from</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that <b>the master is able to say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you,</b> as otherwise the master would not receive compensation for his time in the form of payment for the slave’s earnings while the slave lives off of charity.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> his master <b>provides sustenance for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why is he sustained from charity?</b> He already has sustenance. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to surplus</b> food, i.e., additional food that the slave wants to eat.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> the phrase: <b>Sustained</b> from charity, is imprecise, as it indicates that he is provided only with enough for his basic needs. <b>It should have</b> said: He <b>earns a living</b> from charity. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> his statement that Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that the master <b>can</b> say to his slave: Work for me but I will not sustain you? The Gemara comments: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> his statement that this is the case.",
    "The Gemara discusses the aforementioned <i>halakha</i>. <b>The Master says</b> earlier: <b>He</b> must <b>give</b> compensation for the slave’s loss of <b>livelihood and his medical costs to his master.</b> The Gemara comments: With regard to compensation for loss of <b>livelihood, it is obvious</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>, as the master incurs the loss when his slave does not work, and therefore <b>it was necessary for</b> the Sages to mention only that the compensation for <b>his medical costs</b> goes to his master.",
    "The Gemara comments: Why is the payment for his medical costs given to his master? Shouldn’t the compensation for <b>his medical costs belong to him, as he needs to be healed with it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> doctors <b>estimated</b> that the blow or wound <b>would heal in five days and they made a strong medicine for him, and he was healed in three days</b> instead of five. <b>Lest you say:</b> Since <b>the pain</b> suffered by the slave by taking the strong medicine that caused a decrease in the costs of healing was his, the money should belong <b>to him,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case, as even this money belongs to the master, not the slave.",
    "§ With regard to the discussion in the mishna between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:5) that <b>Rabbi Elazar said: We said to Meir: But isn’t it in the interest of a slave to leave his master to freedom? He said to us: It is to his detriment, as if he were the slave of a priest,</b> then by emancipating him the master thereby <b>disqualifies him from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i>. We said to him: But what</b> would be <b>if</b> the master <b>wishes not to sustain him and not to provide him with a living?</b> He is <b>permitted</b> to do so. Therefore, the slave does not lose out when he is emancipated, as he was not guaranteed sustenance in any event.",
    "Rabbi Meir <b>said to us:</b> Even if the master is not obligated to provide for him, it is still permitted for the slave to partake of <i>teruma</i>. The proof for this is the following case: <b>And what</b> would be <b>if</b> there were <b>the slave of a priest, who fled</b> from his master, <b>or</b> in the case of <b>the wife of a priest, who rebelled against her husband,</b> i.e., she refused to fulfill her obligations as a married woman? Are <b>they not</b> permitted to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> although not the <i>teruma</i> belonging to the master or husband? They are permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>But this</b> slave who was emancipated <b>may not partake</b> of <i>teruma</i> at all, even <i>teruma</i> that belongs to other priests. <b>But</b> in any event, in the case of <b>a woman,</b> a bill of divorce <b>is to her detriment, as it disqualifies her from</b> partaking of <b><i>teruma</i> and causes her to lose</b> her <b>sustenance.</b>",
    "The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What did</b> the Rabbis <b>say to</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>and what</b> did he <b>respond to them?</b> In other words, the two sides do not appear to be discussing the same issue, as the Rabbis refer to sustenance while Rabbi Meir talks about <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> Rabbi Meir <b>is saying</b> to them: <b>You have answered me about sustenance,</b> that the master is not required to provide for his slave. However, <b>what will you answer me about <i>teruma</i>?</b>",
    "<b>And if you were to say</b> that the acceptance of the document by the agent is not to the slave’s detriment, as in any event <b>if</b> the master <b>desires, he can throw the bill</b> of manumission within four cubits of the slave <b>and</b> thereby <b>disqualify him</b> from partaking of <i>teruma</i>; the slave can prevent this from occurring by <b>leaving</b> his master, <b>and escaping and going out to the world.</b> If he acts in this manner his master will be unable to emancipate him, and he can continue partaking of <i>teruma</i>."
