    "<b>Had two</b> men <b>engaged in</b> forced <b>intercourse with her, one in an atypical manner,</b> i.e., anal intercourse, leaving her hymen untouched, <b>and one in a typical manner,</b> vaginal intercourse, in which case the second man pays the fine, people <b>will say:</b> Does it make sense that one who <b>engaged in</b> forced <b>intercourse</b> with <b>a tainted</b> woman, who has had anal intercourse, pays <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>, and one who <b>engaged in</b> forced <b>intercourse</b> with <b>an untainted</b> virgin also pays <b>fifty</b> <i>sela</i>? Apparently, the fifty <i>sela</i> is the fixed sum of the fine, while the rest of the payment varies on a case-by-case basis.",
    "<b>Abaye</b> again <b>said to</b> Rav Zeira: <b>If so,</b> the same claim can be applied <b>with regard to a slave</b> who is killed by an ox. People <b>will say:</b> Does it make sense that <b>a healthy slave</b> is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> and <b>a slave afflicted with boils</b> is also worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>? Yet the mishna clearly indicates that there is no distinction, as the Torah states a fixed amount.",
    "<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the reason the payment of fifty <i>sela</i> does not cover all forms of damage is that <b>the verse states:</b> “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty silver shekels, and she shall be his wife, <b>because he tormented her;</b> he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). This means that the payment is only for the torment, i.e., the rape. It <b>may be inferred that there are</b> additional payments for <b>humiliation and degradation,</b> beyond payment of the fine.",
    "<b>Rava says</b> a different answer, <b>that the verse states: “Then the man that lay with her</b> shall give to the young woman’s father fifty silver shekels” (Deuteronomy 22:29). Rava infers from here that payment for the <b>pleasure of lying</b> with the woman is <b>fifty</b> shekel. It <b>may be inferred</b> from here <b>that there are</b> other <b>matters</b> that must be paid by the rapist. <b>And what are they?</b> Compensation for <b>humiliation and degradation.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a defamer,</b> who falsely claims that his bride was not a virgin, <b>that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent. How so? Both</b> one <b>who defamed</b> a young woman who is the most <b>prominent in the priesthood and</b> one who defamed a young woman who is the <b>lowliest among the Israelites gives</b> payment of <b>one hundred <i>sela</i>,</b> the fine stated in the Torah (Deuteronomy 22:19).",
    "Based on the relative scope of the fines, with the defamer paying twice the sum of the rapist and the seducer, it <b>is apparent</b> that <b>one who utters</b> malicious speech <b>with his mouth</b> is <b>a more severe</b> transgressor <b>than one who performs an action.</b> And this is corroborated, <b>as we found that the sentence imposed on our ancestors in the wilderness was sealed only due to the malicious speech</b> disseminated by the spies, <b>as it is stated</b> at that time: “All those men that have seen My glory, and My signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, <b>yet they have tried Me these ten times</b> and have not listened to My voice” (Numbers 14:22).",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who utters malicious speech with his mouth is a more severe sinner than one who performs an action. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this proven? <b>Perhaps</b> the punishment for the one who defames is more severe <b>because the</b> defamation has the potential <b>to cause</b> his wife’s <b>death. As it is written: “But if this thing be true,</b> that the signs of virginity were not found in the young woman, <b>then they shall bring out the young woman</b> to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die” (Deuteronomy 22:20–21).",
    "<b>Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “And they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the young woman, <b>because he has defamed</b> a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:19). This indicates that he is punished severely for his words, <b>for the defamation,</b> not because she might be put to death.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>As we found that the sentence</b> imposed on our ancestors in the wilderness <b>was sealed only</b> due to the malicious speech disseminated by the spies. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is known that their punishment was due to the malicious speech of the spies? <b>Perhaps</b> until that time <b>their <i>se’a</i>,</b> the measure of their sins warranting punishment, <b>was not</b> yet <b>filled, as Rav Hamnuna says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not punish a person until his <i>se’a</i> is filled, as it is stated: “In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits”</b> (Job 20:22). In other words, one is punished only when he has committed a sufficient number of sins, and the malicious speech of the spies was simply the last of a series of transgressions.",
    "<b>Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “All those men who have seen My glory, and My signs, which I wrought in Egypt and in the wilderness, <b>yet they have tried Me now [<i>zeh</i>] ten times</b> and have not listened to My voice” (Numbers 14:22). The extra word “now [<i>zeh</i>]” teaches that their <b>sentence was sealed for this</b> specific sin, i.e., the malicious speech of the spies.",
    "It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Perata says: Come and see how great the power of malicious speech is. From where do we</b> derive this? <b>From the</b> punishment received by the <b>spies. And if one who defames</b> the <b>wood and rocks</b> of Eretz Yisrael received <b>such</b> a severe punishment, then with regard to <b>one who defames another</b> person, <b>all the more so</b> will he be punished severely.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known that the punishment of the spies was for malicious speech? <b>Perhaps</b> their punishment was <b>due to</b> the sin explained <b>by Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa. As Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: The spies uttered a great statement</b> of blasphemy <b>at that time. As it is written:</b> “But the men that went up with him said: We are not able to go up against the people; <b>for they are stronger than us [<i>mimmennu</i>]”</b> (Numbers 13:31). <b>Do not read</b> this as <b>“for they are stronger than us [<i>mimmennu</i>]” but</b> rather read it as: For they are stronger <b>than Him [<i>mimmennu</i>].</b> i.e., stronger than God. They were saying, <b>as it were,</b> that <b>the owner,</b> i.e., God, <b>cannot remove His utensils,</b> the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, <b>from there.</b> If so, one can explain that the spies were punished for their blasphemy rather than for their malicious speech.",
    "<b>Rather, Rabba says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>the verse states: “Those men that brought up an evil report of the land died</b> by the plague before the Lord” (Numbers 14:37). This teaches that they were punished not for their blasphemy but <b>for the</b> evil <b>report of the land that they brought.</b>",
    "It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Our ancestors tried the Holy One, Blessed be He</b> with <b>ten trials: Two at the sea, and two with water, two with the manna, two with the quail, one with the</b> golden <b>calf, and one in the wilderness of Paran.</b>",
    "The Gemara lists the ten trials in detail. <b>Two at the sea: One when</b> the Jews <b>descended</b> into the sea, <b>and one when</b> they <b>ascended</b> from the sea. The Jews tried God <b>when</b> they <b>descended</b> into the sea, <b>as it is written:</b> “And they said to Moses: <b>Because there were no graves in Egypt,</b> have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this you have done to us, to take us out of Egypt” (Exodus 14:11).",
    "And they also tried God <b>when</b> they <b>ascended</b> from the sea, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: The Jewish people of that generation,</b> during the Exodus, <b>were of little faith.</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement of <b>Rabba bar Mari. As Rabba bar Mari says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But they were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea. Nevertheless, He saved them for His Name’s sake”</b> (Psalms 106:7–8)? This <b>teaches that the Jews were rebellious at that time, and they said: Just as we are ascending from one side, so too</b> perhaps <b>the Egyptians are ascending from</b> the <b>other side,</b> and we will not be saved.",
    "<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the ministering angel of the sea: Spew out</b> the dead Egyptians <b>onto dry land.</b> The ministering angel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a servant whose master gives him a gift and then takes it from him?</b> Since the dead Egyptians were given to me for my fish to eat, how can You retract Your gift? God <b>said to</b> the sea: <b>I will give you one and a half</b> times <b>their</b> number. Although I am taking them back now, later I will give you one and a half times as many people. In the case of the Egyptians it is stated: “Six hundred chosen chariots” (Exodus 14:7), whereas with regard to Sisera, who was defeated at the Kishon Brook, it is written: “Nine hundred chariots of iron” (Judges 4:13).",
    "The ministering angel <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a servant who issues a claim against his master</b> for a gift promised to him? Who will be the guarantor? God <b>said to</b> the ministering angel: <b>The Kishon Brook will be a guarantor</b> for Me. <b>Immediately,</b> the sea <b>spewed</b> the Egyptians <b>out onto the land,</b> and the Jewish people came and saw that they were dead. <b>As it is written: “And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon</b> the seashore” (Exodus 14:30).",
    "The Gemara continues its list of the Jewish people’s trials of God: <b>Two with water:</b> One <b>in Mara and</b> one <b>in Rephidim.</b> The Jewish people tested God <b>in Mara as it is written: “And when they came to Mara, they could not drink</b> of the waters of Mara, for they were bitter. Therefore the name of it was called Mara” (Exodus 15:23), as Mara means bitter. <b>And it is written: “And the people murmured against Moses,</b> saying: What shall we drink?” (Exodus 15:24).",
    "The Jewish people also tested God <b>in Rephidim, as it is written:</b> “And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their stages, according to the commandment of the Lord, <b>and encamped in Rephidim; and there was no water</b> for the people <b>to drink”</b> (Exodus 17:1). <b>And it is written: “And the people fought with Moses,</b> and said: Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them: Why do you fight with me? Why do you test the Lord?” (Exodus 17:2).",
    "The Gemara continues: <b>Two with manna, as it is written:</b>"
