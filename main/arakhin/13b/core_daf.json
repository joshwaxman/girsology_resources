    "<b>that</b> have been <b>inspected in the Chamber of the Lambs</b> for <b>four days prior</b> to the time of their <b>slaughter.</b> The reserve of six lambs ensured that each lamb would be available for inspection for three days prior to the day of its sacrifice, for a total of four. <b>And whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>ben Bag Bag, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>ben Bag Bag says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the daily offering requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter?</b>",
    "<b>The verse states</b> with regard to the daily offering: “My food that is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, of a pleasing aroma unto Me, <b>shall you safeguard to offer unto Me in its due season”</b> (Numbers 28:2); <b>and it states there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: “In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb…<b>and it shall be for you as a safeguard until the fourteenth day of</b> this <b>month”</b> (Exodus 12:3–6), i.e., <b>the first</b> month. Since the word “safeguard” appears in both verses, it is derived that <b>just as</b> in the verse <b>there,</b> the Paschal offering <b>requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter, so too here,</b> the daily offering <b>requires examination four days prior to</b> its <b>slaughter.</b>",
    "The Gemara notes: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise,</b> according to the explanation that the mishna is referring to Shabbat and Rosh HaShana merely as a mnemonic device, <b>as it teaches</b> that the six lambs are <b>sufficient for Shabbat</b> and the two Festival days of Rosh HaShana, <b>and it does not teach</b> that the six lambs are <b>for</b> use on <b>Shabbat</b> and the two days of Rosh HaShana. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> the language of the mishna that this explanation is correct.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that one plays no fewer <b>than two trumpets, and one may add</b> to that number. The Gemara asks: <b>Until how many</b> trumpets may these additions be made? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Huna says, and some say Rav Zavdi says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> They may play <b>up to 120</b> trumpets, <b>as it is stated: “And with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets”</b> (II Chronicles 5:12).",
    "The mishna teaches that one plays no fewer <b>than nine harps</b> and one may add up to an infinite number, <b>and the cymbal</b> was played <b>alone</b> and none may be added to it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Asi says that</b> it is as <b>the verse states: “And Asaph with the cymbals, sounding aloud”</b> (I Chronicles 16:5), which indicates that only one Levite played the cymbals. The Gemara asks: The word <b>cymbals</b> is in the plural, indicating that <b>there were two;</b> why, then, does the mishna say that there is only one cymbal? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> two cymbals <b>perform one act and one person plays them</b> by banging them together, the mishna <b>calls them one</b> instrument.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the Temple, there are <b>no fewer than twelve Levites standing on the platform</b> adjacent to the altar and singing, <b>and one may add</b> Levites on the platform <b>up to an infinite</b> number. <b>A minor</b> Levite may <b>enter the Temple courtyard for service only at a time when the Levites are engaging in song,</b> so that he may accompany them. <b>And</b> minors <b>would not engage in</b> playing <b>a lyre and in</b> playing <b>a harp; rather,</b> they would engage <b>in</b> singing with <b>the mouth, in order to provide flavor to the music</b> with their pure, high voices.",
    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> Minors <b>are not tallied in the</b> minimum <b>total</b> of twelve Levites, <b>and they do not ascend to the platform; rather, they would stand on the ground and their heads</b> would reach to <b>between the legs of the Levites, and they were called cadets [<i>tzoarei</i>] of the Levites.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that a minimum of twelve Levites would stand on the platform and sing. The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> does <b>this</b> number <b>correspond? Rav Pappa says:</b> It <b>corresponds to</b> the minimum number of instruments that were played: <b>Nine harps and two lyres and one cymbal.</b> This number is also alluded to in the Bible, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Instructed in singing unto the Lord…<b>he and his brethren and sons were twelve”</b> (I Chronicles 25:7–9).",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>A minor</b> Levite may <b>enter the Temple courtyard for service only at a time when the Levites</b> are engaging in song. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: As the verse states: “Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, and Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to make music for the workmen in the House of God”</b> (Ezra 3:9). This verse shows that in making music it is preferable to have one’s sons, i.e., minors, as accompaniment.",
    "The mishna teaches: The minors <b>would not engage in</b> playing <b>a lyre and in</b> playing <b>a harp; rather, in</b> singing with <b>the mouth</b> in order to provide flavor to the music with their pure, high voices. The Gemara notes: <b>That is to say that a lyre and a harp are</b> two <b>distinct</b> instruments. <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The harp</b> used <b>in the Temple was</b> an instrument <b>of seven strings, as it is stated: “In your presence is fullness [<i>sova</i>] of joy,</b> in your right hand sweetness for evermore” (Psalms 16:11). <b>Do not read</b> the word as “<b>fullness [<i>sova</i>]” but</b> as <b>seven [<i>sheva</i>].</b> This indicates that the “sweet harp” (see Psalms 81:3) played in the presence of God, i.e., in the Temple, has seven strings.",
    "Rabbi Yehuda continues: <b>And</b> the harp that will be played <b>in the days of the Messiah</b> will have <b>eight</b> strings, <b>as it is stated: “For the Leader, on the eighth:</b> A Psalm of David” (Psalms 12:1). This indicates that the psalms that will be recited in the time of the Messiah, son of David, will be played <b>on the eighth string</b> that will be added to the harp.",
    "And the harp that will be played <b>in the World-to-Come</b> will have <b>ten</b> strings, <b>as it is stated:</b> “A Psalm, a song. For the Shabbat…<b>With an instrument of ten strings and with the lyre, with a solemn sound upon the harp”</b> (Psalms 92:1–4). This indicates that in the World-to-Come, which is comparable to Shabbat, songs of praise to God will be played on a ten-stringed instrument, identified here as both a lyre and a harp.",
    "<b>And</b> similarly, another verse <b>states: “Give thanks unto the Lord with the harp; sing praises unto Him with the lyre of ten strings. Sing unto Him a new song”</b> (Psalms 33:2–3), which is referring to the new song that will be sung only in the World-to-Come. This proof in support of Rabbi Yehuda’s claim that the harp used in the World-to-Come will have ten strings is from a verse that is referring to a ten-stringed lyre, which shows that according to Rabbi Yehuda, the lyre and harp are the same instrument. Therefore, his opinion apparently contradicts the mishna.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as even he agrees that the harp and lyre are essentially two different instruments. But <b>in the World-to-Come, since the strings</b> of the harp <b>will be increased, its sound will be increased like</b> that of <b>the lyre,</b> and therefore <b>he calls</b> the harp <b>a lyre.</b>",
    "The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> The minors <b>are not tallied in the</b> minimum <b>total</b> of twelve Levites…and they were called cadets [<i>tzoarei</i>] of the Levites. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And they were called the helpers [<i>soadei</i>] of the Levites.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, why is he referring to them as <i>tzoarei</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Since these</b> minors had <b>high voices and those</b> adults had <b>deep voices,</b> and <b>these</b> minors would <b>sing in a high voice [<i>mekateti</i>], and those</b> adults could <b>not sing in</b> such <b>a high voice, they were called <i>tzoarei</i>,</b> as they caused the adult Levites anguish [<i>tza’ar</i>] due to the fact that they could not produce the same pleasant sounds as the minors.",

    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to valuations that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; and</b> there are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to an ancestral field that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; and</b> there are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a forewarned ox that killed</b> a Canaanite <b>slave that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent;</b> and there are <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to a rapist, and a seducer, and a defamer that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent.</b>",
    "<b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to valuations that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; how so? Both</b> in the case of one <b>who took</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> to donate the fixed value <b>of the</b> most <b>attractive among the Jewish people and</b> in the case of one who took a vow of valuation to donate the fixed value of <b>the</b> most <b>unsightly among the Jewish people, he gives</b> the fixed payment of <b>fifty <i>sela</i>,</b> shekels, to the Temple treasury (see Leviticus 27:3). <b>And if</b> one <b>said: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate the <b>assessment</b> of another to the Temple treasury, <b>he gives the price</b> for that person if sold as a slave, a sum that can be more or less than fifty shekels.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: <b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>with regard to valuations that are lenient and</b> others <b>that are stringent; how so?

The Gemara infers from this that if the vow of valuation referred <b>to a Jew, yes,</b> he pays the fixed value; but if one took a vow of valuation to donate the fixed value <b>of gentiles,</b> he does <b>not</b> pay the fixed value.",
    "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (5b): With regard to <b>a gentile, Rabbi Meir says: He is valuated</b> in a case where a Jew says: It is incumbent upon me to donate the fixed value of this gentile; <b>but</b> a gentile <b>does not take</b> a vow of <b>valuation</b> to donate his fixed value or the value of others.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as it can be claimed that <b>the same is true,</b> i.e. <b>that even</b> if one took a vow of valuation to donate the fixed value of <b>a gentile,</b> he <b>also</b> pays the fixed amount. <b>But</b>"
