    "<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies in a case of <b>a man who valuated</b> another, <b>whether a man or a woman,</b> as the section begins: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow” (Leviticus 27:2). <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> of valuations also applies to <b>a woman who valuated a man,</b> or <b>a woman who valuated a woman?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> same <b>verse states:</b> “Vow of <b>persons</b> to the Lord, according to your valuation,” to include women.",
    "<b>Alternatively,</b> the word <b>“persons”</b> serves <b>to add a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils.</b> If one valuates such a person, he is obligated to give the set amount according to age and sex.",
    "This derivation is necessary <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse states: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), it is juxtaposing a person who is valuated and one who is the object of a vow. Therefore, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments,</b> i.e., one who is obligated to pay his assessment to the Temple if he takes such a vow, <b>is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> If he vows to pay his valuation, he must pay. <b>But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations.</b> Having no market value, these people are not subject to assessment, and are consequently also not subject to valuation. <b>The verse,</b> therefore, <b>states: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> teaching that anyone who has any amount of life [<i>nefesh</i>] is subject to valuation.",
    "A <i>baraita</i> teaches that the apparently superfluous phrase: <b>“Then your valuation shall be”</b> (Leviticus 27:3), serves <b>to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments,</b> despite the fact that they are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. If one assesses a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite, he is obligated to give that assessment. The <i>baraita</i> explains <b>that</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that since the verse states: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation,” anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations is</b> also included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments, but anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations is</b> also <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>assessments.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be,”</b> to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in the <i>halakha</i> of assessment.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: This <i>halakha</i>, that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are not included in valuation, is derived from the term: <b>“The male”</b> (Leviticus 27:3). The definite article teaches that this <i>halakha</i> applies specifically to <b>a male, and not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite <b>should not be</b> valuated <b>by</b> the <b>valuation of a man, but</b> they <b>should be</b> valuated <b>by</b> the <b>valuation of a woman.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be for the male…and if it be a female”</b> (Leviticus 27:3–4). This teaches that valuation applies only to <b>a definite male</b> or <b>a definite female, but not</b> to <b>a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite,</b> who are categorized as neither male nor female.",
    "§ <b>The Master said</b> above in the beginning of the <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), serves <b>to include an unspecified valuation.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>an unspecified valuation?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>an unspecified valuation,</b> without specifying any particular person, <b>gives</b> the amount <b>of the smallest of the valuations. And how much is the smallest of the valuations?</b> It is <b>three shekels,</b> which is the valuation of a female who is younger than five years old (Leviticus 27:6).",
    "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that one who does not specify a person should give <b>fifty</b> shekels, which is the largest of the valuations, that of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty (Leviticus 27:3)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: This ruling is based on the principle that if <b>you grasped a lot you did not grasp</b> anything, but if <b>you grasped a little, you grasped</b> something. In other words, if one can derive two sums from the verses, one should choose the smaller number, as it is included within the larger number and is therefore considered certain.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that smallest of the valuations is one <b>shekel, as it is written: “And all your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 27:25)? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written with regard to affordability.</b> If one vows to donate the valuation of a person to the Temple treasury but does not have sufficient funds to fulfill his vow, he must pay at least a shekel.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> since the payment of three shekels can be derived from the principle of grasping the lesser amount, <b>why do I</b> need <b>the verse</b> “according to your valuation”? <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The verse is required <b>to teach that</b> unlike other valuations, where a person who cannot afford the set amount can fulfill his obligation with one shekel, in the case of an unspecified valuation even a poor person’s obligation <b>is not determined by affordability,</b> and he must give at least three shekels. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: It is because it is <b>considered as though</b> he <b>explicitly</b> vowed that he is obligated to pay three shekels. The principle of affordability applies only to the valuations fixed by the Torah.",
    "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> the opposite: The term “according to your valuation” actually teaches that even an unspecified valuation is <b>determined based on affordability,</b> and a poor person fulfills his obligation by giving one shekel. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Why would one think that this case differs from any other valuation? The Gemara answers that the verse is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that one who obligates himself in an unspecified valuation is <b>considered as though</b> he <b>articulated</b> that he is obligated to pay three shekels, and may not pay less. Therefore, this verse <b>teaches us</b> that an unspecified valuation is also subject to affordability, like other valuations.",
    "§ It is further stated in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>Alternatively,</b> the term <b>“according to your valuation”</b> teaches that <b>one gives the valuation of his entire</b> self <b>and does not give the valuation of</b> the <b>value of limbs.</b> If one vows that he will give the valuation of a limb, he is not obligated to give anything. The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> from <b>this</b> term: “According to your valuation,” the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an unspecified valuation.</b> How can you then derive another <i>halakha</i> from the same source? The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> this term two sources, as it could have merely written: <b>“Valuation,”</b> and instead it wrote: <b>“According to your valuation.”</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> adds: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> should <b>exclude</b> even the valuation of <b>an item upon which the soul is dependent,</b> without which one will die, e.g., the head. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],”</b> which teaches that if one valuated a limb upon which the soul [<i>nefesh</i>] is dependent, he is obligated to give the valuation of his entire self. In addition, we derive from <b>“persons”</b> that one is obligated to pay only the valuation of a live person, <b>and not</b> the valuation of <b>the dead.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> from <b>this</b> term: “Persons [<i>nefashot</i>],” that one who valuates a limb upon which the soul [<i>nefesh</i>] is dependent is obligated to give the valuation of his entire self. The Gemara answers: <b>Read into</b> the verse two derivations, as it could have merely written: <b>Person,</b> and instead it wrote: <b>Persons.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: Perhaps <b>I should exclude</b> only <b>the dead</b> from valuation, as they no longer possess life [<i>nefesh</i>], <b>but I should not exclude a moribund</b> person, as he is still alive. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him” (Leviticus 27:8). This teaches that anyone included in the category of setting, i.e., who can stand, is included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation. But one who is on his deathbed is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuation.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let me also derive</b> that the <b>dead</b> are not subject to valuation <b>from</b> the same verse: <b>“Then he shall be set</b> before the priest, <b>and</b> the priest <b>shall value</b> him,” as the dead cannot stand. Why do I need to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the fact that the verse wrote: “Persons,” instead of person? The Gemara answers that <b>so too,</b> this is correct, i.e., the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the dead is derived from that same verse. <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>why do I</b> need the derivation based on the difference between <b>person</b> and <b>“persons”?</b> The Gemara answers that this teaches a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>as we are about to state below,</b> i.e., to add a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils.",
    "The Gemara continues its review of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Alternatively,</b> as the verse states: <b>“Persons,”</b> in the plural, it is expounded as follows. Were the verse to have written only: A person, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this applies to <b>one</b> person who <b>valuated one</b> person. <b>From where</b> is it derived that even if <b>one</b> person <b>valuated a hundred</b> people, this is also an effective evaluation? Thefore, <b>the verse states: “Persons,”</b> in the plural.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Alternatively,</b> one can expound the plural form of <b>“persons”</b> as follows: Were the verse to have written only: A person, one might have said that <b>I can</b> derive <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>a man who valuates</b> anyone, <b>whether a man or a woman,</b> as the section begins: “When a man clearly utters a vow” (Leviticus 27:2). <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> of valuations also applies to <b>a woman who valuated a man, or a woman who valuated a woman? The</b> same <b>verse states:</b> “Vow of <b>persons</b> to the Lord, according to your valuation” (Leviticus 27:2), to include women.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Alternatively,</b> the word <b>“persons”</b> serves <b>to add a repulsive</b> man <b>and one afflicted with boils.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But you have</b> already <b>derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>these</b> cases, i.e., one who valuated a hundred men or a woman who valuated, from “persons.” How, then, can you derive the <i>halakha</i> of a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils from this same word?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>These do not require</b> another <b>verse. What is the reason?</b> Each of these <i>halakhot</i> <b>is equivalent</b> to the others, i.e., each derivation from the word: Person, is equally valid. It teaches that one may valuate a limb that is vital to a person, that both men and women may take a vow of valuation, and that one may vow to give the valuation of multiple people. There is no reason to prefer one of these derivations over the others. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>all of them are derived</b> from the word: Person. <b>When the verse,</b> i.e., the plural term “persons,” <b>is required,</b> it <b>is required</b> only <b>to</b> include <b>a repulsive man and one afflicted with boils.</b>",
    "§ The <i>baraita</i> also teaches that the phrase: <b>“Then your valuation shall be”</b> (Leviticus 27:2), serves <b>to include a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments,</b> despite the fact that they are not included in the <i>halakha</i> of valuations. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to include them in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>assessments?</b> Even <b>let</b> this <b>be</b> considered <b>only</b> like the <b>assessment of a tree; were</b> one to <b>say: The assessment of</b> that <b>tree</b> is incumbent upon me, <b>is he not</b> obligated to <b>give</b> its assessment?",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> The verse serves <b>to say that</b> a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that one specified. If one vowed to give a vital part of his body, he is not merely obligated to pay the value of that organ but must give the value of his entire body.",
    "As it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: <b>“A vow</b> of persons to the Lord, <b>according to your valuation,”</b> a person who is valuated is juxtaposed to one who is the object of a vow of assessments. Therefore, <b>anyone who is</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations is</b> also included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of being <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that he specifies. <b>But anyone who is not</b> included <b>in</b> the category of <b>valuations,</b> such as a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite, <b>is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of being <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that he specifies. Therefore, the verse teaches that although a <i>tumtum</i> and a hermaphrodite are not included in valuations, they are nevertheless included in the <i>halakha</i> of being assessed by the significance of the body part in question.",
    "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>And is it true</b> that one who <b>is not</b> included <b>in valuations is</b> nevertheless <b>assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that he specifies? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if one says: The <b>head of this slave</b> is <b>consecrated property, he and the Temple</b> treasury are <b>partners in</b> the entire slave. Similarly, if one says to another: The <b>head of</b> this <b>slave</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> they <b>appraise</b> the slave and split the value <b>between them.</b> Likewise, if one says: The <b>head of this donkey</b> is <b>consecrated property, he and the Temple</b> treasury are <b>partners in</b> the donkey. And if one says to another: The <b>head of</b> this <b>donkey</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> they <b>appraise</b> the donkey and split the value <b>between them.</b>",
    "But if one says to another: The <b>head of</b> this <b>cow</b> is <b>sold to you,</b> he has <b>sold him only the head of the cow. Moreover, even</b> if he says: The <b>head of</b> this <b>cow</b> is <b>consecrated property, the Temple</b> treasury <b>has</b> ownership <b>only</b> of the cow’s <b>head. And Rav Pappa said:</b> This difference between these cases is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>head of an ox is sold</b> independently <b>in the butcher shop.</b>",
    "Abaye explains the difficulty that arises from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>But isn’t</b> it the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a donkey and a cow</b> are <b>not</b> included <b>in valuations, and</b> therefore are <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that is mentioned? If one consecrated their heads, their entire body is not consecrated. <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of assessment by the significance of the specified body part is contingent on inclusion in valuations, the case of <b>a slave should pose a difficulty for you:</b> A slave <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>valuations,</b> as stated in the mishna, <b>and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> teaches that he is <b>not assessed by</b> the <b>significance</b> of the body part that is specified.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> this is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that in the case of a slave or donkey the head alone is consecrated, is referring <b>to items consecrated</b> in order to purchase offerings for <b>the altar.</b> On the other hand, <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that in the case of a <i>tumtum</i> one must pay his entire value, is referring <b>to items consecrated for Temple maintenance.</b> In such a case, it is assessed by the significance of the body part that is specified. Here we follow the paradigm of valuation, whose payment is also used for Temple maintenance.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you interpret</b> the <i>baraita</i> that discusses consecrating the head of a slave? You interpreted it <b>as</b> dealing with a case of <b>items consecrated</b> in order to purchase offerings for <b>the altar.</b> But if so, <b>say the latter clause: Moreover, even</b> if he <b>says:</b> The <b>head of this cow</b> is <b>consecrated property, the Temple</b> treasury <b>has</b> ownership <b>only</b> of the cow’s <b>head.</b> According to this interpretation, that it is referring to items consecrated for the altar, <b>why</b> is the head alone consecrated? <b>Let</b> its <b>sanctity spread throughout the entire</b> cow. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>one says:</b>"
