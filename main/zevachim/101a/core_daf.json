    "<b>And</b> the same holds for the night after the day of burial, even though the acute mourning of that day itself is by rabbinic law, because <b>the Sages reinforced their pronouncements with greater</b> severity <b>than Torah</b> law.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On the eighth day of the inauguration of the Tabernacle, on which two of Aaron’s sons died, Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons using three different forms of the word command: <b>“For so I am commanded [<i>tzuveiti</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:13), <b>“as I commanded [<i>tziveiti</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:18), and <b>“as the Lord has commanded [<i>tziva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 10:15). Moses said to Aaron: “And you shall eat it…<b>for so I am commanded,”</b> to teach that Aaron and his remaining sons <b>shall partake of</b> the offerings even <b>in acute mourning.</b> The statement: “You should certainly have eaten it…<b>as I commanded,”</b> Moses <b>said to them at the time of</b> the <b>incident,</b> when Aaron and his sons burned the sin offering for the New Moon. Moses said: <b>“As the Lord has commanded,”</b> to emphasize that it is <b>not of my own</b> initiative that <b>I say</b> this, but it is from the word of God.",
    "<b>And</b> the Sages <b>raise a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The sin offering <b>was burned due to</b> the <b>acute mourning</b> of Aaron and his sons, since they felt they could not partake of it. <b>Therefore,</b> it <b>is stated</b> in Aaron’s explanation: “There have befallen me such things <b>as these;</b> and if I had consumed the sin offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord?” (Leviticus 10:19). Moses conceded to Aaron that he was correct (see Leviticus 10:20), indicating that it was not permitted for Aaron to partake of the sin offering in acute mourning.",
    "<b>Shmuel said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first <i>baraita</i>, according to which Moses commanded Aaron and his sons to consume the sacrificial meat in acute mourning, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda;</b> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, according to which they acted properly in refraining from eating it, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya.</b>",
    "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Aaron and his sons <b>burned</b> the sin offering <b>due to</b> their <b>acute mourning. Therefore,</b> it <b>is stated: “As these”;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Neḥemya. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> The sin offering <b>was burned due to ritual impurity. As, if you say</b> that it <b>was burned due to acute mourning,</b> they <b>should have burned</b> all <b>three of</b> the sin offerings offered that day. <b>Alternatively,</b> if it was burned due to acute mourning, <b>they would have been fit to partake of</b> the sin offerings <b>in the evening,</b> and there would have been no need to burn them. <b>Alternatively,</b> if it was burned due to acute mourning, <b>wasn’t Pinehas,</b> son of Elazar the priest, <b>with them?</b> He was not in mourning, and he could have partaken of the sin offering.",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> who holds that the sin offering was burned due to acute mourning. <b>And</b> this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> according to which Moses commanded that Aaron and his sons partake of the offering as acute mourners is referring <b>to the offerings of</b> a particular <b>time,</b> i.e., the meal offering, which was unique to the inauguration ceremony. <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> according to which they rightly burned the sin offering, due to acute mourning, is referring <b>to the offerings of</b> all future <b>generations.</b> That sin offering was brought for the New Moon of Nisan, and such an offering would be brought at every New Moon from that day onward. Moses conceded that such offerings should not be consumed by acute mourners.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>How</b> would <b>Rabbi Neḥemya reconcile these</b> apparently contradictory <b>verses</b> about the sin offering, <b>and how</b> would <b>the Sages reconcile these verses</b> (see Leviticus 10:17–20)?",
    "<b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> would <b>reconcile them like this:</b> When Moses asked: <b>“Why have you not eaten</b> the sin offering?” (Leviticus 10:17), this is what <b>Moses said to Aaron: Perhaps the blood of</b> this sin offering <b>entered the innermost sanctum,</b> thereby disqualifying it (see Leviticus 6:23). Is this why you burned it? Aaron <b>said to him: “Behold, the blood of it was not brought</b> into the Sanctuary within” (Leviticus 10:18). Moses then asked: <b>Perhaps it went outside its partition,</b> i.e., it exited the courtyard of the Tabernacle, and was thereby disqualified? Aaron <b>said to him: It was inside the sacred</b> area at all times.",
    "Moses then suggested: <b>But perhaps you sacrificed it in acute mourning,</b> which is prohibited for ordinary priests, <b>and disqualified it.</b> Aaron <b>said to him: Moses, was it they,</b> i.e., my sons, <b>who sacrificed</b> the offering? <b>I sacrificed</b> the offering, and as High Priest, I may serve even as an acute mourner (see Leviticus 21:10–12). <b>And</b> Moses <b>said to him: “Behold, the blood of it was not brought</b> into the Sanctuary within,” <b>and it was inside the sacred</b> area at all times; therefore: <b>“You should certainly have consumed it</b> in the sacred area, <b>as I commanded”</b> (Leviticus 10:18), i.e., just as I commanded that the priests should <b>consume</b> today’s meal offering <b>in acute mourning.</b>",
    "Aaron <b>said to him:</b> “Behold, today have they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering before the Lord, <b>and there have befallen me such things as these; and if I had consumed the sin offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of the Lord?”</b> (Leviticus 10:19). <b>Perhaps you heard</b> the command to consume the offering <b>only with regard to offerings of</b> a particular <b>time,</b> i.e., the meal offering, which was unique to that day.",
    "<b>As, if</b> you claim that it also applies <b>to the offerings of</b> all <b>generations,</b> then one can prove this is not so via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the second <b>tithe,</b> for <b>which</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> more <b>lenient</b> than for sacrificial meat: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the second <b>tithe,</b> for <b>which</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> more <b>lenient, the Torah stated: “I have not eaten thereof in my mourning [<i>ve’oni</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:14), teaching that an acute mourner [<i>onen</i>] is prohibited from partaking of it, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that <b>with regard to the offerings of</b> all <b>generations,</b> an acute mourner is prohibited from partaking of them?",
    "Moses <b>immediately conceded</b> to Aaron, as the verse states: <b>“And Moses heard, and it was good in his eyes”</b> (Leviticus 10:20). <b>And Moses was not embarrassed</b> and did not attempt to justify himself <b>by saying: I did not hear</b> of this <i>halakha</i> until now. <b>Rather, he said: I heard</b> it, <b>and I forgot</b> it, as the verse indicates by stating: “Moses heard.”",
    "The Gemara continues: <b>And how</b> would <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon,</b> who hold that the sin offering was burned due to ritual impurity, <b>reconcile those</b> verses? <b>They</b> would <b>reconcile them like this:</b> When Moses said to Aaron and his sons: <b>“Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the Sanctuary?”</b> (Leviticus 10:17), he meant: <b>Perhaps its blood entered the innermost sanctum,</b> disqualifying the offering. Aaron <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>“Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the Sanctuary within”</b> (Leviticus 10:18).",
    "Moses then asked: <b>Perhaps it went outside its partition,</b> i.e., the courtyard of the Tabernacle, and was thereby disqualified? Aaron <b>said to him: It was inside the sacred</b> area at all times. Moses then asked: <b>But perhaps you sacrificed it in acute mourning and disqualified it?</b> Aaron <b>said to him: Moses,</b> was it my sons who <b>sacrificed</b> the offering, <b>that</b> their <b>acute mourning</b> would <b>disqualify</b> the offering? <b>I,</b> the High Priest, <b>sacrificed</b> the offering, and I may serve even in acute mourning.",
    "Moses then asked: <b>Or perhaps, due to your bitterness</b> in mourning, <b>were you neglectful of</b> the offering <b>and it became impure?</b> Aaron <b>said to him: Moses, am I in your eyes such</b> a person, <b>that I</b> would <b>treat</b> an offering <b>consecrated to Heaven with contempt? “There have befallen me such things as these”</b> (Leviticus 10:19), i.e., <b>even</b> if <b>these</b> tragedies <b>and</b> more <b>such as them</b> should befall me, <b>I</b> would <b>not treat</b> an offering <b>consecrated to Heaven with contempt.</b>",
    "Moses <b>said to him:</b> If so, <b>and if,</b> as you say: <b>“Behold, the blood of it was not brought</b> into the Sanctuary within,” <b>and</b> it <b>was inside the sacred</b> area at all times, then: <b>“You should certainly have eaten it in the sacred area, as I commanded,”</b> i.e., as I commanded that the priests should <b>consume</b> the meal offering even <b>in acute mourning.</b>",
    "Aaron <b>said to him: Perhaps you heard</b> the command to consume the offering <b>only with regard to the night</b> following the day of acute mourning, but during the day itself the prohibition stands. <b>As, if</b> you claim that it may be consumed <b>during the day</b> itself, I can prove that this is not so via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the second <b>tithe,</b> for <b>which</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> more <b>lenient</b> than for sacrificial meat: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the second <b>tithe,</b> for <b>which</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> more <b>lenient, the Torah stated: I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that in the <b>stringent</b> case of <b>sacrificial</b> meat, an acute mourner is prohibited from partaking of it?",
    "Moses <b>immediately</b> conceded to Aaron, as the verse states: <b>“And Moses heard,</b>"
