    "the <b>head of a pigeon</b> burnt offering <b>that does not have</b> on it <b>an olive-bulk</b> of flesh, <b>but</b> the <b>salt</b> that adheres to it, after it was salted in accordance with the requirement to salt it (see Leviticus 2:13), <b>completes</b> the measure <b>to</b> make <b>an olive-bulk, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is one liable for offering it up outside?",
    "<b>Rava from Parzakya said to Rav Ashi: Is this not</b> identical to <b>the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> with regard to a bone attached to sacrificial flesh? Rav Ashi responded: No. <b>The dilemma can be raised according to Rabbi Yoḥanan and the dilemma can be raised according to Reish Lakish.</b>",
    "The Gemara elaborates: <b>The dilemma can be raised according to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> Perhaps <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan states</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> with regard to <b>a bone,</b> claiming that it contributes to the measure of an olive-bulk <b>as it is</b> of <b>the</b> same <b>kind that flesh</b> is, i.e., they are both animal parts. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>salt, which is not</b> of <b>the</b> same <b>kind as a pigeon,</b> perhaps it would <b>not</b> contribute to the measure. And <b>the dilemma can</b> also <b>be raised according to Reish Lakish:</b> Perhaps <b>Reish Lakish states</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> with regard to a bone, claiming that it does not contribute to the measure of an olive-bulk, <b>as if</b> the bone <b>separates from</b> the flesh, there is <b>no mitzva to offer</b> the bone <b>up</b> on the altar. <b>But here,</b> with regard to salt, concerning <b>which if it separates</b> from the pigeon there is <b>a mitzva to offer</b> it <b>up,</b> he would <b>not</b> rule as he does concerning a bone attached to flesh. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between the cases.",
    "The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> If he slaughtered an offering inside the courtyard and then offered it up outside the courtyard, he is liable. But if he slaughtered it outside, thereby rendering it unfit, and then he offered it up outside, he is exempt for the offering up, as he offered up only an item that is unfit, and one is liable only for offering up an item that is fit to be offered up inside the Temple. The Rabbis said to him: According to your reasoning, even in a case where he slaughters it inside and offers it up outside, he should be exempt, since he rendered it unfit the moment that he took it outside the courtyard. Yet, in such a case, he is certainly liable for offering it up. So too, one who slaughters an offering outside and then offers it up outside is liable.",
    "While a defense of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion is not presented in the mishna, various possibilities are recorded in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>responded</b> to this challenge <b>on behalf of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: What</b> is notable <b>about slaughtering</b> an offering <b>inside</b> the courtyard <b>and</b> then <b>offering</b> it <b>up outside?</b> It is notable in <b>that</b> the offering <b>had a period of fitness. Can you say</b> the same <b>about slaughtering</b> an offering <b>outside and</b> then <b>offering</b> it <b>up outside, where</b> the offering <b>never had a period of fitness?</b> It was disqualified as soon as it was slaughtered and so it is reasonable that one is not liable for offering it up.",
    "<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, responded</b> to this challenge <b>on behalf of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili: What</b> is notable <b>about slaughtering</b> an offering <b>inside</b> the courtyard <b>and</b> then <b>offering</b> it <b>up outside?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> even though the offering was taken outside the courtyard and thereby disqualified, if it is, albeit unlawfully, placed on the altar, the <b>sanctity</b> of the altar <b>renders</b> the offering <b>acceptable</b> and it should not be removed from the altar because the disqualification occurred in sanctity, i.e., during the course of the Temple service (see 84a). <b>Can you say</b> the same <b>about slaughtering</b> an offering <b>outside</b> and then offering it up outside, <b>where</b> the disqualification did not occur in sanctity and so the <b>sanctity</b> of the altar <b>does not render</b> the offering <b>acceptable?</b> Therefore, even if it were placed there, it must be removed.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the practical difference <b>between these</b> two responses? <b>Ze’eiri said:</b> The practical difference <b>between them is</b> a case of <b>slaughtering</b> an offering <b>at night</b> inside the courtyard and then offering it up outside. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s response, one would be exempt, as slaughtering at night disqualifies the offering from its very outset; whereas according to the response of Rabbi Elazar, one would be liable as this is a disqualification that occurs in sanctity.",
    "<b>Rabba said:</b> The practical difference <b>between them is</b> a case in which, after slaughtering the offering in the courtyard, the <b>collection</b> of the blood was done there <b>in a non-sacred vessel</b> and then the animal was offered up outside the courtyard. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s defense, one would be exempt, as collecting the blood in a non-sacred vessel disqualifies the offering from its very outset; whereas according to the response of Rabbi Elazar, one would be liable as this is a disqualification that occurs in sanctity.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: One who is <b>ritually impure who ate</b> sacrificial food, <b>whether</b> it was ritually impure <b>sacrificial</b> food or ritually pure sacrificial food, is liable to receive <i>karet</i> if he did so intentionally, and to bring a sliding-scale offering if he did so unwittingly. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: An impure person who ate pure sacrificial food is liable. But an impure person who ate impure sacrificial food is exempt, as he merely ate an impure item, and the prohibition against eating sacrificial food while one is impure applies only to pure sacrificial food. The Rabbis said to him: According to your logic, even in a case of an impure person who ate what had been pure sacrificial food, once he has touched it, he has thereby rendered it ritually impure. Yet, in such a case, he is certainly liable for eating it. So too, an impure person who ate impure sacrificial food is liable.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>The Rabbis are saying well to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili;</b> why does Rabbi Yosei HaGelili disagree?",
    "<b>Rava said</b> in elaboration of the dispute: <b>Wherever</b> one is first <b>rendered impure</b> with <b>impurity of the body and</b> then <b>afterward</b> the sacrificial <b>meat is rendered impure, everyone agrees that</b> he is <b>liable</b> if he eats the meat. This is <b>because</b> the prohibition due to the <b>impurity of</b> one’s <b>body,</b> which carries the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i>,</b> took effect while the meat was still ritually pure, and so this prohibition is not abrogated even when the meat is later rendered impure.",
    "<b>When they disagree</b> is in a case where first the <b>meat is rendered impure and</b> then <b>afterward the</b> person’s <b>body is rendered impure.</b> In general, once an item has become subject to a prohibition, it cannot then become subject to an additional prohibition. In this case, once the meat is rendered impure, it is prohibited for anyone to eat it, even if that person is ritually pure. If that person is later rendered impure, the meat should not become subject to the additional prohibition against a ritually impure person eating sacrificial meat.",
    "Rava explains that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and the Rabbis disagree as to whether this case is an exception to that principle, <b>as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we say</b> that <b>since</b> the prohibition due to the ritual impurity of one’s body is a more inclusive prohibition, as it prohibits that person from eating all sacrificial meat, both pure and impure, it therefore takes effect also with regard to this meat, even though it was already rendered impure before the person was. <b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> that <b>we do not say</b> that <b>since</b> it is a more inclusive prohibition, it takes effect.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even according to <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili, <b>granted that we do not say</b> that <b>since</b> it is a more inclusive prohibition it will take effect. But still, the prohibition due to the <b>impurity of</b> a person’s <b>body, which</b> is <b>a more stringent</b> prohibition as it carries the punishment of <i>karet</i>, <b>should come and take effect upon</b> the prohibition due to the <b>ritual impurity</b> of the <b>meat</b> itself, as that prohibition is less stringent as it carries only the punishment of lashes. One exception to the principle that a second prohibition does not take effect is that even if an item or person is already subject to a prohibition, a more stringent prohibition will still take effect with regard to it.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said: From where</b> is it apparent <b>that</b> the prohibition due to the <b>impurity of the</b> person’s <b>body is more stringent? Perhaps</b> the prohibition due to the <b>impurity of</b> the <b>meat is more stringent, as</b> impure meat <b>does not have</b> the possibility of <b>purification in a ritual bath,</b> whereas a ritually impure person does. Since the prohibition due to the person’s impurity is not more stringent in every regard, it cannot take effect upon meat that is already prohibited due to its own impurity.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is <b>a greater stringency with regard to slaughtering</b> outside the Temple courtyard <b>than with regard to offering up</b> outside, <b>and</b> there is a greater stringency <b>with regard to offering up</b> outside <b>than with regard to slaughtering</b> outside.",
    "The mishna elaborates: The <b>greater stringency with regard to slaughtering</b> outside is <b>that one who slaughters</b> an offering outside the Temple courtyard even <b>for</b> the sake of <b>an ordinary</b> purpose, not for the sake of God, is <b>liable. But one who offers up</b> an offering outside the courtyard <b>for</b> the sake of <b>an ordinary</b> purpose is <b>exempt.</b> The <b>greater stringency with regard to offering up</b> outside is that <b>two</b> people <b>who grasped a knife and</b> together <b>slaughtered</b> an offering outside the courtyard are <b>exempt.</b> But if two <b>grasped a limb</b> from an offering <b>and</b> together <b>offered</b> it <b>up</b> outside, they are <b>liable.</b>",
    "If one unwittingly <b>offered up</b> part of an offering outside the courtyard <b>and then</b> in a different lapse of awareness <b>offered up</b> other parts of that offering <b>and then</b> again, in another lapse of awareness, <b>offered up</b> yet other parts, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for each</b> act of <b>offering up;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering.",
    "Rabbi Yosei adds: <b>And</b> one is <b>liable</b> for offering up an offering outside the courtyard <b>only once he offers</b> it <b>up at the top of an altar</b> that was erected there. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if <b>he offered</b> it <b>up on a rock or on a stone,</b> not an altar, he is <b>liable.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the first <i>halakha</i> of the mishna: <b>What is different</b> about <b>one who offers up</b> outside <b>for</b> the sake of <b>an ordinary</b> purpose, <b>that he is exempt? As it is written:</b> “And he will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, to sacrifice it <b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:9), which indicates that the liability applies only to offering up for the sake of the Lord. The Gemara questions this: But <b>with regard to slaughtering, isn’t it also written:</b> “Or that slaughters it outside the camp, and he did not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice an offering <b>to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:3–4)?",
    "The Gemara explains: It <b>is different there,</b> with regard to slaughtering, <b>as the verse states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> of the house of Israel…that slaughters it outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3). The amplification indicated by the phrase “<i>ish ish</i>” teaches that one is liable even for slaughtering for the sake of an ordinary purpose. The Gemara challenges: But <b>also with regard to offering up it is written: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]</b> of the house of Israel…that offers up a burnt offering” (Leviticus 17:8). The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> amplification <b>is necessary to</b> teach that <b>two people who offered up a limb</b> of an offering together outside the courtyard are <b>liable.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, here too,</b> with regard to slaughtering, the phrase “<i>ish ish</i>” <b>should be</b> used <b>to</b> teach that <b>two</b> people <b>who grasped a knife and</b> together <b>slaughtered</b> an offering outside the courtyard are <b>liable,</b> contrary to the ruling of the mishna. Why are the two parallel phrases expounded in different ways? The Gemara explains: <b>It is different there,</b> with regard to slaughtering, <b>as the verse states:</b> “And <b>that</b> man shall be cut off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:4). The term “that man,” which is in the singular, indicates that only <b>one</b> who acts alone is liable, <b>but not two</b> who act together.",
    "The Gemara challenges: But <b>if so, also with regard to offering up, isn’t it written: “That</b> man shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 17:9)? Why isn’t that term also expounded to teach that only one who acts alone is liable? The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> term <b>is necessary</b>"
