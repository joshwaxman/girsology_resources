    "The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a thanks offering?</b> It is unique <b>in that it requires</b> a meal offering of forty loaves of <b>bread.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: If so, <b>a burnt offering and a peace offering can prove</b> the point, as loaves are not brought with them. <b>And the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point. The <i>halakha</i> is derived from a combination of the two sources: <b>The aspect of this</b> case, a burnt offering and a peace offering, <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case, a thanks offering, <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case. <b>Their common element is that they are offerings, and</b> if one <b>slaughtered them not for their sake,</b> they are <b>fit but do not propitiate</b> God. <b>So too, I shall include a guilt offering</b> in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is an offering, and</b> therefore if one <b>slaughtered it not for its sake,</b> it is <b>fit but does not propitiate</b> God.",
    "The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about the common element of</b> a thanks offering, a burnt offering, and a peace offering? It is unique in <b>that</b> these offerings <b>are brought</b> either <b>as a vow</b> offering <b>or as a gift</b> offering, whereas a guilt offering is brought only to fulfill an obligation.",
    "<b>Rather, Rava says: The verse: “This is the law</b> of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:37), <b>juxtaposes</b> a guilt offering <b>with a peace offering,</b> indicating that <b>just as peace offerings are offerings and</b> if one <b>slaughtered them not for their sake, they are fit but do not propitiate, so too, I shall include a guilt offering, as it is an offering,</b> and therefore if it is slaughtered not for its sake, although it is fit, it does not satisfy the obligation of its owner.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see,</b> i.e., why do you think it is reasonable, <b>that you compared</b> a guilt offering <b>to a peace offering?</b> Why not <b>compare</b> it <b>to a sin offering,</b> which is disqualified in such a case?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>The Merciful One excluded</b> all other offerings from the <i>halakha</i> concerning a sin offering in this matter, as derived from the verse: “And slaughter <b>it</b> for a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:33).",
    "The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the <i>amora’im</i> who participated in the two following discussions: <b><i>Heh</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>shin</i>; <i>beit</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>reish</i>.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Huna and Rav Naḥman were sitting, and Rav Sheshet was sitting with them. And they were sitting and saying: Reish Lakish raised</b> his <b>difficulty</b> with regard to <b>a guilt offering, since it is not brought after</b> its owner’s <b>death. Let Rabbi Elazar say to him</b> that <b>a guilt offering is also</b> essentially <b>brought after</b> its owner’s <b>death,</b> since it is sold once it develops a blemish, and the proceeds are used to buy a burnt offering.",
    "<b>Rav Sheshet said to them:</b> This claim can be refuted: <b>What</b> element <b>of a guilt offering is sacrificed</b> after its owner’s death? Only <b>its remainder,</b> i.e., the money from its sale that is used to purchase an animal to be sacrificed. And if so, it is no different from <b>a sin offering, the remainder of which is also sacrificed,</b> and a sin offering itself is entirely disqualified if slaughtered not for its sake.",
    "Rav Huna and Rav Naḥman explained: <b>A sin offering</b> that was slaughtered not for its sake is disqualified <b>even though its remainder is sacrificed,</b> because <b>the Merciful One</b> specifically <b>excludes</b> a sin offering from being a fit offering if sacrificed not for its own sake, as derived from the verse: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and slaughter it in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering before the Lord; <b>it</b> is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). The redundant phrase “it is a sin offering” teaches that a sin offering is disqualified if sacrificed not for its own sake.",
    "The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>also written with regard to a guilt offering:</b> “And the priest shall make them smoke upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the Lord; <b>it</b> is a guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:5)? Why is a guilt offering not disqualified when it is slaughtered not for its sake?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse <b>is written</b> not with regard to the main sacrificial rites, but with regard to the stage <b>after the burning of the</b> offering’s <b>sacrificial portions</b> on the altar, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>But with regard to a guilt offering,</b> the term <b>“It</b> is a guilt offering” <b>is stated only after the burning of the sacrificial portions. And</b> since the guilt offering <b>itself</b> is <b>fit</b> even <b>if the sacrificial portions were not burned</b> at all, it is certainly fit if they were burned not for the sake of a guilt offering.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“It</b> is a guilt offering” to be stated at all? The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>for that which Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says. As Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>a guilt offering</b> whose owner died or whose transgression was otherwise atoned for, and <b>that was</b> therefore <b>consigned</b> by the court <b>to grazing</b> until it develops a blemish so that it can be sold and the proceeds used to purchase a burnt offering, if, before it developed a blemish, someone <b>slaughtered it without specification</b> of its purpose, it is <b>fit</b> as a burnt offering.",
    "The Gemara infers: If <b>it was consigned</b> to grazing, <b>yes,</b> it is fit as a burnt offering if slaughtered. By inference, if <b>it was not consigned</b> to grazing, it is <b>not</b> fit. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The verse states: “It</b> is a guilt offering,” indicating that <b>it shall</b> remain <b>as it is,</b> i.e., as a guilt offering, unless it is consigned by the court to fulfill another purpose.",
    "§ <b>Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet were sitting, and Rav Adda bar Mattana was sitting with them. And they were sitting and saying:</b> In response to <b>that which Rabbi Elazar said</b> to Reish Lakish: <b>We have found</b> a precedent for this situation <b>in</b> the case of offerings that <b>are brought after</b> their owners’ <b>death, as they are fit but they do not propitiate</b> God, <b>let Reish Lakish say to him: These</b> offerings <b>should also be brought and propitiate</b> God with regard to the heirs. Why did Reish Lakish not challenge Rabbi Elazar’s assumption?",
    "<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said to them:</b> How can the offering of <b>a woman after childbirth</b> propitiate God after her death? <b>If she gave birth, did her children give birth?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Asi objects to this</b> reasoning: <b>And who shall say to us that if</b> a woman <b>has several</b> violations of <b>positive mitzvot</b> for which to atone, <b>she does not atone</b> by means of the burnt offering she brings after childbirth for her purification? Clearly, such offerings can atone for transgressions other than those for which they are brought. <b>And since, when she has several</b> violations of <b>positive mitzvot she atones</b> by means of the offering, <b>so too,</b> if she dies, <b>her heirs atone</b> by this offering for their own violations of positive mitzvot.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> the offering is <b>acquired by</b> the heirs, and this is why it atones for their transgressions? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that if one <b>left his two sons a meal offering and</b> then <b>died,</b> the offering must be <b>sacrificed, and it does not have</b> the status of a meal offering brought in <b>partnership? And if it enters your mind</b> that the offering is <b>acquired by</b> the heirs, it should be considered a meal offering brought in partnership, which is unfit, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “And when <b>one</b> brings a meal offering unto the Lord” (Leviticus 2:1). The word “one” teaches that two people cannot bring a meal offering together. Clearly, the heirs do not inherit the offering, and if so, it should not atone for their transgressions.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> the offering <b>not acquired by them? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself <b>say</b> that if one <b>left his two sons an animal</b> offering <b>and</b> then <b>died,</b> the offering must be <b>sacrificed, and they cannot effect substitution</b> of another animal <b>for it?</b> Even if they declare another animal to be a substitute for it, that animal is not consecrated. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the offering is <b>acquired by them, this is</b> the reason <b>that they cannot effect substitution</b> of another animal <b>for it:</b> It is <b>because they are like partners,</b>"
