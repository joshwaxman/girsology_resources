    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b> This inference is not valid, as <b>we find</b> that <b>a leftover sin offering,</b> e.g., one bought with money left over from funds dedicated to the acquisition of a sin offering, <b>is brought</b> as <b>a burnt offering,</b> whereas <b>a leftover burnt offering is not brought</b> as <b>a sin offering.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> according to Rabbi Eliezer’s logic, one should derive <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering, whose leftover is brought</b> as <b>a burnt offering,</b> nevertheless, if one <b>slaughtered it for the sake of a burnt offering</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> so too, with regard to <b>a burnt offering, whose leftover is not brought</b> as <b>a sin offering,</b> if one <b>slaughtered it for the sake of a sin offering, isn’t it logical that it should be unfit?</b> Yet, the <i>halakha</i> is that a burnt offering slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering is fit.",
    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: No, if you said</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a sin offering,</b> that another offering sacrificed for its sake is fit, this is only <b>because</b> a sin offering <b>is fit</b> when sacrificed <b>for its sake all year long. Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a Paschal offering, which is fit</b> when sacrificed <b>for its sake only at its</b> designated <b>time? Since</b> a Paschal offering <b>is unfit</b> when sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> during the rest of the year, <b>it is logical that other</b> offerings <b>should be disqualified</b> when sacrificed <b>for its sake</b> at its designated time.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Shimon, brother of Azarya, says</b> that this is the distinction: With regard to all offerings, if one slaughtered them for the sake of an offering whose sanctity is greater than theirs, they are fit; if one slaughtered them for the sake of an offering whose sanctity is less than theirs, they are unfit.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi teaches in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches</b> the same statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yannai: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Shimon, brother of Azarya?</b> It is derived from that <b>which the verse states: “And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they will set apart [<i>yarimu</i>] unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 22:15). The verse is interpreted not as a prohibition but as a halakhic axiom, teaching that offerings <b>are not profaned,</b> i.e., disqualified, <b>by</b> sacrifice for the sake of offerings whose sanctity is <b>more elevated [<i>muram</i>] than theirs; they are profaned</b> only <b>by</b> sacrifice for the sake of offerings whose sanctity is <b>less than theirs.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And does that</b> verse <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? <b>But isn’t it necessary for Shmuel’s</b> derivation? <b>As Shmuel says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who eats untithed produce is</b> liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven? <b>As it is stated: “And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they will set apart unto the Lord.”</b> The term: “Will set apart,” indicates that <b>the verse is speaking of</b> holy items <b>that are to be set apart in the future,</b> i.e., untithed produce, which includes the portion designated for the priest [<i>teruma</i>].",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if <b>the verse</b> taught only one <i>halakha</i>, the <i>halakha</i> of Shimon, brother of Azarya, it <b>should have written: Which they have set apart. What</b> is the reason the verse states: <b>“Which they will set apart,”</b> in the future tense? <b>Conclude from it</b> that the verse teaches <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i>: An offering sacrificed for the sake of an offering of greater sanctity is fit, and consumption of untithed produce is punishable by death at the hand of Heaven.",
    "<b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> According to Shimon, brother of Azaria, who says that less sacred offerings sacrificed for the sake of more sacred offerings are fit, perhaps they <b>are fit but do not propitiate</b> God, i.e., they do not fulfill the owner’s obligation, as the Rabbis hold. If so, <b>when</b> Shimon, brother of Azaria, <b>disagrees</b> with the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna, <b>he disagrees</b> only <b>with regard to one</b> matter, i.e., that more sacred offerings sacrificed for the sake of less sacred ones are disqualified altogether. <b>Alternatively, perhaps</b> Shimon, brother of Azaria, holds that if less sacred offerings are sacrificed for the sake of more sacred offerings they are both <b>fit and propitiate</b> God, <b>and they disagree</b> with the Rabbis <b>about two</b> matters.",
    "<b>Abaye, and some say Rabbi Zerika, said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof that they do not satisfy the owners’ obligation: Shimon, brother of Azarya, elaborated on his opinion in the mishna: <b>A firstborn</b> animal <b>and the</b> animal <b>tithe that one slaughtered for the sake of peace offerings are fit,</b> as the sanctity of peace offerings is greater. <b>Peace offerings that one slaughtered for the sake of a firstborn</b> animal <b>or for the sake of</b> the animal <b>tithe are unfit.</b>",
    "<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that offerings sacrificed for the sake of offerings of greater sanctity are both <b>fit and propitiate</b> God, <b>is a firstborn</b> an offering that <b>propitiates?</b> Sacrificing a firstborn does not serve to propitiate God; <b>rather,</b> conclude that such offerings <b>are fit but do not propitiate. And</b> one can infer that <b>since</b> in <b>the latter clause they are fit but do not propitiate,</b> in <b>the former clause as well,</b> concerning all offerings of lesser sanctity slaughtered for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order, <b>they are fit but do not propitiate.</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b> Perhaps Shimon, brother of Azarya, holds that offerings of lesser sanctity slaughtered for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order propitiate God, but a firstborn animal and animal tithe slaughtered for the sake of peace offerings do not propitiate God.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what is</b> the latter clause concerning a firstborn and animal tithe <b>teaching us,</b> if not that no offerings of lesser sanctity propitiate God when sacrificed for the sake of offerings of greater sanctity? How is the clause not redundant? <b>Does it teach us</b> an example of offerings of <b>higher</b> sanctity <b>and</b> offerings of <b>lower</b> sanctity? <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> such an example in the former clause, which teaches: <b>How so? Offerings of the most sacred order that one slaughtered for the sake of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> are unfit; offerings of lesser sanctity slaughtered for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order are fit.",
    "The Gemara answers: It is stated <b>lest you say that</b> the <i>halakha</i> of offerings of <b>higher</b> sanctity <b>and</b> offerings of <b>lower</b> sanctity <b>applies only</b> when the difference is between <b>offerings of the most sacred order and offerings of lesser sanctity, but</b> with regard to offerings of <b>lesser</b> sanctity <b>and</b> other offerings of <b>lesser</b> sanctity this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply, as they are all considered to possess the same level of sanctity. Therefore the mishna adds the example of a firstborn animal and animal tithe slaughtered for the sake of peace offerings, to clarify that one can distinguish between different offerings of lesser sanctity as well.",
    "The Gemara raises an objection to this answer: <b>We</b> already <b>learn this as well,</b> in another mishna (89a): The <b>peace offering precedes</b> sacrifice of <b>the firstborn because</b> the peace offering <b>requires placement</b> of its blood twice so as to be visible on <b>four</b> sides of the altar, <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>libations, and waving of</b> the <b>breast and thigh</b> by the priest and the owner, none of which is required for the firstborn.",
    "The Gemara answers: The <b>primary</b> mention of the distinction is in <b>this</b> mishna; <b>that</b> mishna <b>cites it incidentally,</b> in discussing the order of precedence of offerings.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the Paschal offering that one slaughtered</b> on the <b>morning of</b> the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan, the day when the Paschal offering should be slaughtered in the afternoon, if he did so <b>not for its sake, Rabbi Yehoshua deems it fit as though it were slaughtered on the thirteenth</b> of Nisan. An animal consecrated as a Paschal offering that was slaughtered not at its designated time for the sake of a different offering is fit for sacrifice as a peace offering. <b>Ben Beteira deems it unfit as though it were slaughtered</b> in the <b>afternoon</b> of the fourteenth.",
    "<b>Shimon ben Azzai said: I received</b> a tradition <b>from seventy-two elders,</b> as the Sanhedrin deliberated and decided <b>on the day that they installed Rabbi Elazar</b> ben Azarya <b>at</b> the head of <b>the yeshiva</b> and ruled <b>that all the slaughtered offerings that are eaten that were slaughtered not for their sake are fit, but</b> these offerings <b>did not satisfy the obligation of the owner, except for the Paschal offering and the sin offering.</b> Based on that version, <b>ben Azzai added</b> to the <i>halakha</i> cited in the first mishna <b>only the burnt offering,</b> which is not eaten, <b>and the Rabbis</b> disagreed and <b>did not concede to him.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: With regard to a Paschal offering that one slaughtered</b> on the <b>morning of</b> the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>for its sake, ben Beteira would deem</b> it <b>fit, as</b> he held that <b>the entire day,</b> not only the afternoon, <b>is its</b> designated <b>time.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the reason the mishna states that according to ben Beteira, a Paschal offering slaughtered on the morning of the fourteenth is considered <b>as though</b> it were slaughtered in the afternoon? This language seems to indicate that it does not have the same status as a Paschal offering actually slaughtered in the afternoon.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>Since Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> the term: <b>As though</b> it were slaughtered on the thirteenth, ben Beteira <b>also says</b> the term: <b>As though</b> it were slaughtered in the afternoon. But in fact he maintains that there is no difference between a Paschal offering slaughtered on the morning of the fourteenth and one slaughtered in the afternoon.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, rather than disagreeing</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to</b> a Paschal offering that was slaughtered on the morning of the fourteenth <b>not for its sake, let them disagree with regard to</b> one slaughtered <b>for its sake;</b> ben Beteira holds that it is fit, and Rabbi Yehoshua holds that it is unfit.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the mishna were to write only that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> a Paschal offering slaughtered <b>for its sake, I would say: But in</b> a case where it was slaughtered <b>not for its sake, Rabbi Yehoshua concedes to ben Beteira</b> that it is disqualified, even though it was slaughtered in the morning, <b>since</b> at least <b>part of</b> the day, the afternoon, is <b>fit</b> for its sacrifice as a Paschal offering. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that they disagree with regard to this case as well.",
    "The Gemara asks: How can ben Beteira claim that a Paschal offering may be slaughtered in the morning? <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “And the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it <b>in the afternoon [<i>bein ha’arbayim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 12:6)?",
    "<b>Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, says:</b> Ben Beteira interprets the phrase <i>bein ha’arbayim</i> literally: <b>Between two evenings,</b> i.e., between the eve of the fourteenth and the night after the fourteenth. Accordingly, the Paschal offering may be sacrificed all day long.",
    "The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to the <b>daily offering, concerning which it is written:</b> “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer <b><i>bein ha’arbayim</i>”</b> (Numbers 28:4), is <b>the entire day fit</b> for sacrifice <b>also?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>There, since it is written: “The one lamb you shall offer in the morning,” by inference,</b> the term <b><i>bein ha’arbayim</i></b> is referring to the <b>actual afternoon.</b>",
    "The Gemara counters: <b>Say</b> that <b>one</b> of the lambs should be sacrificed <b>in the morning,</b> and <b>the other</b> one can be sacrificed <b>all day.</b> Why is it evident from the requirement that one be sacrificed in the morning that the other must sacrificed in the afternoon?",
    "The Gemara answers: The clause <b>“One</b> lamb you shall offer <b>in the morning”</b> indicates that <b>two</b> lambs are <b>not</b> sacrificed <b>in the morning;</b> the other must perforce be sacrificed in the afternoon.",
    "The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>lamps</b> of the Candelabrum, one should say the same, <b>as it is written:</b> “And when Aaron lights the lamps <b><i>bein ha’arbayim</i>”</b> (Exodus 30:8). Is <b>the entire day fit</b> for lighting <b>also,</b> according to the opinion of ben Beteira?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as it is written:</b> “To burn <b>from evening to morning”</b> (Exodus 27:21). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“from evening to morning”</b> indicates that you must <b>allocate</b> the Candelabrum <b>its measure</b> of oil so <b>that it will burn from evening until morning. Alternatively,</b> the same verse can be interpreted as follows: <b>Only this rite is valid from evening until morning,</b> since all other rites must be performed during the day. Therefore, the Candelabrum is lit only at the end of the day.",
    "The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>incense,</b> one should say likewise, <b>as it is written with regard to it: “<i>Bein ha’arbayim</i></b> he shall burn it” (Exodus 30:8). Is <b>the entire day also fit</b> for burning the incense according to the opinion of ben Beteira?",
    "The Gemara answers: The <b>incense is different,</b>"
