    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>any</b> burnt offering <b>for which the altar did not acquire its flesh,</b> e.g., if it was disqualified prior to the sprinkling of its blood, the <b>priests did not acquire its hide, as it is stated</b> with regard to the burnt offering: “And the priest that sacrifices <b>a man’s burnt offering,</b> the priest shall have to himself the hide of the burnt offering that he has sacrificed” (Leviticus 7:8), indicating that the priest acquires only the hide of <b>a burnt offering that satisfied</b> the obligation <b>of a man.</b>",
    "Nevertheless, in a case of <b>a burnt offering that was slaughtered not for its sake</b> but for the sake of another offering, <b>although it did not satisfy</b> the obligation <b>of the owner, its hide</b> goes <b>to the priests.</b> In addition, although the verse states: “A man’s burnt offering,” in the case of <b>both the burnt offering of a man and the burnt offering of a woman, their hides</b> go <b>to the priests.</b>",
    "<b>The hides of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> belong <b>to the owners; the hides of offerings of the most sacred order</b> belong <b>to the priests.</b> The right of priests to hides of offerings of the most sacred order is derived via <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> for <b>a burnt offering, for which</b> the priests <b>do not acquire its flesh,</b> as it is burned in its entirety, <b>they acquire its hide,</b> then for other <b>offerings of the most sacred order, for which</b> the priests <b>acquire its flesh, is it not right that they should acquire its hide?</b> And <b>there is no</b> room to contend that the <b>altar will prove</b> that this is not a valid inference, as it acquires the flesh of a burnt offering but not its hide, <b>since it does not have</b> the right to the <b>hide</b> of an offering <b>in any place.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“a man’s burnt offering”</b> in the verse mentioned above serves <b>to exclude the burnt offering of consecrated</b> property, meaning that the priests do not acquire the hides of such offerings. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> The phrase serves <b>to exclude the burnt offering of converts.</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> does Rabbi Yehuda mean when he says that the phrase serves <b>to exclude the burnt offering of consecrated</b> property? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> He means it serves <b>to exclude a burnt offering that comes from</b> property that was <b>left over.</b> For example, if an animal consecrated as a guilt offering remains alive after its owner has achieved atonement by sacrificing another animal, the owner must wait until it acquires a blemish and then sell it. The proceeds are used to purchase a communal gift offering, which is sacrificed when there are no other offerings to be burned on the altar (see <i>Temura</i> 20b). Because it is a communal offering, it is not considered a man’s burnt offering, and the priests therefore have no right to the hide.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says: Leftover</b> consecrated property <b>goes toward communal gift</b> offerings. <b>But according to the one who says: Leftover</b> consecrated property <b>goes toward an individual’s gift</b> offering, <b>what can be said?</b> As this is a man’s burnt offering, the priests should have a right to the hides.",
    "The Gemara answers: According to that opinion, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>as Rava says:</b> The verse states: “And the priest shall kindle wood on it every morning; and he shall lay <b>the burnt offering</b> in order upon it” (Leviticus 6:5). The verse states: “The burnt offering,” with the definite article, to teach that the daily burnt offering is the <b>first burnt offering</b> sacrificed each day in the Temple. <b>Here too,</b> the verse states: “The priest shall have to himself the hide of <b>the burnt offering</b> which he has offered,” to teach that the priest acquires the hide of <b>a first burnt offering,</b> i.e., an animal that was initially designated as a burnt offering, but not of a burnt offering purchased from proceeds left over from another offering.",
    "<b>Rabbi Aivu</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s statement can be interpreted differently. The phrase “a man’s burnt offering” serves <b>to exclude</b> a case of <b>one who consecrates a burnt offering for Temple maintenance.</b> Since the owner seeks to shift its ownership to the Temple, the priests have no right to its hides.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>It is not necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>consecration for Temple maintenance applies by Torah law</b> to offerings already consecrated to the altar, as the animal in fact ceases to belong to the individual, and the priests clearly have no claim to its hide. <b>Rather, even according to the one who says</b> that it <b>does not apply</b> by Torah law, because the offering is already consecrated for the altar, <b>this matter</b> applies only to the <b>meat; but</b> as for the <b>hide,</b> the consecration for Temple maintenance <b>applies</b> and nullifies the priests’ claim to it.",
    "The Gemara returns to the explanation of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef and comments: <b>And so says Rav Naḥman</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The phrase “a man’s burnt offering” serves <b>to exclude a burnt offering that comes from</b> property that was <b>left over.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Hamnuna said to Rav Naḥman: In accordance with whose</b> statement is your opinion? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> But <b>didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>retract</b> this statement? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The mishna in tractate <i>Shekalim</i> (6:5) states that the Temple had <b>six</b> collection boxes shaped like horns, <b>for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. These funds would go <b>toward burnt offerings that come from</b> money that was <b>left over.</b> For example, if someone dedicated money to purchasing an offering, and after his purchase some of the sum remained, he would put it in these boxes. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the priests have no right to the hide of</b> such an offering. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Neḥemya said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> said to him: <b>If so, you have nullified the interpretation of Jehoiada the priest. As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6:6) that <b>Jehoiada the priest taught this interpretation:</b> The verse states: <b>“It is a guilt offering; he is certainly guilty before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:19). The phrase “before the Lord” teaches that if <b>any</b> money <b>comes on account of a sin offering or on account of a guilt offering,</b> i.e., it is left over after their purchase, <b>burnt offerings must be purchased with it,</b> and their <b>flesh</b> must be burned on the altar <b>to the Lord.</b> But <b>its hide</b> shall go <b>to the priests.</b> Rabbi Yehuda did not respond, indicating that he conceded that the hides of such offerings go to the priests.",
    "Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Hamnuna: <b>But how does the Master interpret</b> the phrase: “A man’s burnt offering,” as meaning? Rav Hamnuna <b>said to him: I interpret it</b> as referring <b>to one who consecrates</b> all <b>his property,</b> including animals fit for burnt offerings. If these animals are later sacrificed as burnt offerings, the priests do not acquire the hides, since the offerings are consecrated property.",
    "<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:7): If <b>one consecrates his property</b> without specifying the purpose, generally speaking, it goes toward Temple maintenance. <b>But</b> if <b>among it were animals fit to</b> be sacrificed on the <b>altar,</b> either <b>male or female,</b> then <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Animals that are fit for offerings must be sacrificed. Therefore, the <b>male</b> animals <b>shall be sold for the purpose of burnt offerings</b> to those who need to bring such offerings, and the <b>female</b> animals, which cannot be brought as burnt offerings, <b>shall be sold for the purpose of peace offerings</b> to those who need to bring such offerings. <b>And</b> because they were consecrated for Temple maintenance, <b>their proceeds shall be allocated with the rest of</b> the person’s <b>property for Temple maintenance.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The donor intended that all animals fit for sacrifice be brought as burnt offerings, and the rest of his property be given for Temple maintenance. Therefore, the <b>males shall be sacrificed themselves</b> as <b>burnt offerings; and</b> the <b>females shall be sold for the purpose of</b> being sacrificed as <b>peace offerings, and he shall bring burnt offerings with their proceeds; and the rest of</b> his <b>property shall be allocated for Temple maintenance.</b>",
    "Rav Hamnuna explains: <b>And even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who says</b> that <b>a person divides his consecrated</b> property, as he rules that the animals are themselves sacrificed while the other property is given for Temple maintenance, <b>this statement</b> applies specifically to the <b>flesh,</b> which is fit to be burned on the altar; <b>but</b> as for the <b>hide,</b> which is not, the fund for Temple maintenance <b>acquires</b> it from the outset, and the priests therefore have no right to it. This is the <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Yehuda derives from the phrase “a man’s burnt offering.”",
    "The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> The phrase “a man’s burnt offering” serves <b>to exclude the burnt offering of converts.</b> The priests do not acquire the hides of such offerings. <b>Rav Simai bar Ḥilkai said to Ravina: Is that to say</b> that <b>a convert is not</b> included in the category of <b>a man?</b> Ravina <b>said to him:</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, meant that the verse serves <b>to exclude</b> the burnt offering of <b>a convert who died and has no heirs.</b> The offering has no owner, and therefore the priests do not acquire its hide.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And the priest that offers <b>a man’s burnt offering,</b> the priest shall have to himself the hide of the burnt offering that he has sacrificed” (Leviticus 7:8). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a man’s burnt offering,</b> i.e., that of a born-Jewish male. <b>From where</b> is the same derived with regard to <b>the burnt offering of converts, women, or</b> Canaanite <b>slaves? The verse states: “The hide of the burnt offering,”</b> and it thereby <b>included</b> these as well.",
    "<b>And if so, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “A man’s burnt offering”?</b> It serves to teach that the priests acquire the hide only of <b>a burnt offering that satisfied</b> the obligation <b>of a man,</b> i.e., <b>to exclude</b> a burnt offering <b>that was slaughtered</b> with the intention of consuming it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time or outside its</b> designated <b>area</b> and was thereby disqualified. The verse teaches <b>that the priests have no right to the hide of</b> such an offering.",
    "One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I include</b> a burnt offering <b>that was not slaughtered for its own sake</b> but for the sake of another offering. <b>Since it does not satisfy</b> the obligation <b>of the owner,</b>"
