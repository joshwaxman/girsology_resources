    "with regard to <b>a burnt offering, which is</b> totally <b>consumed</b> by the fire on the altar, nevertheless, even if <b>its blood enters into</b> the Sanctuary it is <b>fit,</b> with regard to <b>a guilt offering, which is not</b> entirely <b>consumed</b> on the altar, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that even if its blood enters the Sanctuary it remains fit?",
    "The Gemara refutes this inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a burnt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it does not atone</b> for a sin. Perhaps this is why its blood is not disqualified if it enters the sanctuary.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>The meal offering of a sinner can prove</b> the point, as it is not disqualified by entering the Sanctuary, even though it atones for a sin.",
    "The Gemara interjects: <b>But let us say</b> that <b>a bird sin offering can prove</b> the point, as it too atones for a sin but is not disqualified by entering the Sanctuary. This case is more similar to that of a guilt offering, as a bird has blood, unlike a meal offering. The Gemara answers: It is not certain that <b>a bird sin offering</b> is not disqualified by entering the Sanctuary; this <b>is a dilemma</b> raised <b>by Rabbi Avin.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But let us refute</b> the above response as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a sinner’s meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it is not a type of slaughtered offering.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: If so, <b>a burnt offering can prove</b> the point, since it is a slaughtered offering, and still if its blood enters the Sanctuary, it is not disqualified. <b>And the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point. The <i>halakha</i> is derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of a burnt offering and a sinner’s meal offering: <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case. <b>Their common element is that they are offerings of the most sacred order, and</b> if they <b>enter into</b> the Sanctuary <b>they are</b> still <b>fit. So too, I shall include a guilt offering</b> and infer that <b>since it is</b> also <b>an offering of the most sacred order,</b> if <b>its blood enters into</b> the Sanctuary it is still <b>fit.</b>",
    "<b>Rava of Barnish said to Rav Ashi: But let us refute</b> this inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common element?</b> It is notable <b>in that neither</b> a burnt offering nor a sinner’s meal offering <b>has a fixed</b> value. <b>Should you say</b> the same <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to a guilt offering, which has a fixed</b> value?",
    "<b>Rather, this is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis: As the verse states:</b> “And any sin offering, any of <b>whose blood</b> is brought into the Tent of Meeting to atone in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:23). The term “whose blood” teaches that <b>the blood of this</b> offering, i.e., a sin offering, <b>and not the blood of another</b> offering, is disqualified in this manner.",
    "<b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Eliezer, interpret this term? He derives from it that only <b>its blood</b> is disqualified by entering the Sanctuary, <b>but not its flesh.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> from where do <b>the other</b> Rabbis derive that the flesh of a sin offering is not disqualified by entering the Sanctuary? They maintain that both <i>halakhot</i> are derived from this term, as the verse could have simply stated: <b>Blood,</b> but stated: <b>“Whose blood.”</b> The redundancy excludes not only the flesh, but also other offerings.",
    "<b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Eliezer, <b>does not interpret</b> the redundancy indicated by the change from: <b>Blood,</b> to: <b>“Whose blood,”</b> to be significant. Once the word blood is mentioned, it is grammatically necessary for the verse to state “whose blood.”",
    "§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the dispute in the mishna between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis. <b>Granted, according to the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>a guilt offering that one slaughtered not for its sake</b> is <b>fit, that is why a meal offering is juxtaposed with a sin offering,</b> and <b>a meal offering</b> is also juxtaposed <b>with a guilt offering.</b>",
    "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states with regard to a meal offering: <b>“It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:10), teaching that <b>a meal offering of a sinner is like a sin offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed its handful not for its sake,</b> it is <b>disqualified.</b> And the verse also teaches that <b>a voluntary meal offering is like a guilt offering. Therefore,</b> if one <b>removed its handful not for its sake,</b> it is still <b>fit.</b> This accords with the opinion of the Rabbis, that a guilt offering slaughtered not for its sake is fit.",
    "<b>But according to Rabbi Eliezer, for what <i>halakha</i> is a meal offering juxtaposed with a sin offering, and a meal offering</b> juxtaposed <b>with a guilt offering?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: They are juxtaposed <b>to</b> teach <b>the other</b> <i>halakha</i> derived <b>by Rabbi Shimon</b> from this verse; <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 26a): If the handful of a meal offering is conveyed to the altar <b>not in a service vessel,</b> the offering is <b>unfit. And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>",
    "<b>And Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states</b> with regard to a meal offering: <b>“It is most sacred, as the sin offering, and as the guilt offering,”</b> teaching that if a priest <b>comes to perform</b> its sacrificial rites <b>by hand, he must perform</b> them <b>with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, <b>like</b> one performs the rites of <b>a sin offering.</b> And if he performs them <b>with a vessel, he may perform</b> them <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>like</b> one performs the rites of <b>a guilt offering,</b> since Rabbi Shimon maintains this is permitted in the case of a guilt offering.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> himself, <b>does he expound this verse for this</b> purpose, concerning one who if one removes its handful not for its sake, <b>and expound it for that</b> purpose, concerning conveying the handful with one’s hand?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>The verse comes mainly to</b> teach <b>that which Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> explained. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that a meal offering of a sinner</b> whose handful was removed <b>not for its sake</b> is <b>unfit is</b> due to <b>another reason: What is the reason a sin offering</b> sacrificed not for its sake is disqualified? The reason is <b>that</b> the word <b>“it” is written with regard to it</b> in the verse: “It is a sin offering” (Leviticus 4:24). Since the word <b>“it” is also written with regard to the meal offering of a sinner,</b> in the verse: “For it is a sin offering” (Leviticus 5:11), the same applies in that case.",
    "In the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer cites the verse: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering” (Leviticus 7:7), as a source for his opinion. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the Rabbis, for what <i>halakha</i> is a guilt offering juxtaposed with a sin offering?</b> The Gemara answers: They are juxtaposed <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as a sin offering requires placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>so too, a guilt offering requires placing hands</b> on the head of the offering.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Yosef ben Ḥoni says:</b> Other offerings <b>that are slaughtered</b> for the sake of a Paschal offering or a sin offering are unfit. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Yosef ben Ḥoni and Rabbi Eliezer said the same thing,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer agrees with Yosef ben Ḥoni.",
    "<b>Rabba says:</b> Although they agree that other offerings slaughtered for the sake of a Paschal offering are unfit, <b>they disagree with regard to other</b> offerings slaughtered <b>for the sake of a sin offering.</b> Whereas Yosef ben Ḥoni holds that they are unfit, Rabbi Eliezer maintains that they are fit.",
    "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Paschal offering whose</b> first <b>year has passed,</b> and it must therefore be sacrificed as a peace offering, <b>and one slaughtered it at its</b> designated <b>time</b> on Passover eve <b>for its own sake</b> as a Paschal offering, <b>and likewise,</b> if <b>one slaughtered other</b> offerings <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering at its</b> designated <b>time,</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree as to the status of the offering. <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>unfit, and Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> it <b>fit.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: If, during the rest of the days of the year, when</b> a Paschal offering <b>is not fit</b> if it is slaughtered <b>for its own sake,</b> nevertheless, <b>other</b> offerings that are slaughtered <b>for its sake are fit,</b> then <b>at its</b> designated <b>time, when</b> a Paschal offering <b>is fit</b> if it is slaughtered <b>for its own sake, isn’t it logical that other</b> offerings slaughtered <b>for its sake should be fit?</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Or conversely, just as during the rest of the days of the year, when</b> a Paschal offering <b>is not fit</b> if it is slaughtered <b>for its own sake, it is fit</b> if slaughtered <b>for the sake of other</b> offerings, so too, <b>at its</b> designated <b>time, when it is fit</b> if slaughtered <b>for its own sake, isn’t it logical that it should be fit</b> if slaughtered <b>for the sake of other</b> offerings? <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>a Paschal offering</b> slaughtered <b>not for its own sake on</b> the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan <b>should be deemed fit,</b> which contradicts the <i>halakha</i>. Clearly, this line of reasoning leads to incorrect conclusions.",
    "Furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer refuted Rabbi Yehoshua’s logic as follows: <b>And do you say this</b> derivation? <b>What</b> does it matter <b>to me</b> that <b>other</b> offerings slaughtered <b>during the rest of the days of the year for the sake of</b> a Paschal offering <b>are deemed fit? After all,</b> a Paschal offering slaughtered <b>for the sake of other</b> offerings <b>is</b> also <b>fit. But</b> must you say that <b>other</b> offerings slaughtered <b>at its</b> designated <b>time for its sake should be deemed fit? After all,</b> at its designated time, a Paschal offering slaughtered <b>for the sake of other</b> offerings <b>is unfit.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: If,</b> as you maintain, other offerings slaughtered on Passover eve for the sake of a Paschal offering are disqualified, <b>you have diminished the force</b> of the requirement that <b>a Paschal offering</b> be sacrificed for its own sake, <b>and you have given</b> more <b>force to</b> the requirement that <b>a peace offering</b> be sacrificed for its own sake. A Paschal offering sacrificed at the proper time, i.e., during the rest of the year, for the sake of a peace offering, is fit, whereas a peace offering sacrificed on Passover eve for the sake of a Paschal offering is unfit.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer then presented a different logical inference: We find</b> that <b>a leftover Paschal offering,</b> an animal consecrated as a Paschal offering but ultimately not sacrificed on Passover eve, is <b>brought</b> as <b>a peace offering; but a leftover peace offering,</b> one bought with money left over from funds dedicated toward the acquisition of a peace offering, is <b>not brought</b> as <b>a Paschal offering.</b> A Paschal offering is a potential peace offering, but a peace offering is not a potential Paschal offering.",
    "<b>And</b> if so, one may infer <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a Paschal offering, whose leftover</b> offering <b>is brought</b> as <b>a peace offering,</b> and nevertheless, if one <b>slaughtered it at its</b> designated <b>time for the sake of a peace offering</b> it is <b>unfit,</b> so too, with regard to <b>a peace offering, whose leftover</b> offering <b>is not brought</b> as <b>a Paschal offering, if</b> one <b>slaughtered</b> it <b>for the sake of a Paschal offering at its</b> designated <b>time, isn’t it logical that</b> it <b>should be unfit?</b>"
