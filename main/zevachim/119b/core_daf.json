    "a reference to <b>Shiloh,</b> and with regard to <b>“inheritance,” this</b> is a reference to <b>Jerusalem, or the reverse,</b> i.e., that “rest” is a reference to Jerusalem and “inheritance” is a reference to Shiloh, <b>this is as it is written: “To the rest and to the inheritance [<i>el hamenuḥa ve’el hanaḥala</i>],”</b> utilizing two different phrases. <b>But according to the one,</b> i.e., the school of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>who says</b> that <b>this and that</b> are both references to <b>Shiloh, or</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai that both <b>this and that</b> are references to <b>Jerusalem,</b> the verse <b>should have</b> stated: For you have not as yet come to the <b>rest</b> and <b>inheritance [<i>menuḥa naḥala</i>].</b> The Gemara concedes that this is <b>difficult.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, <b>who says this and that</b> are references to <b>Shiloh,</b> each of the designations may be explained: It is called <b>“rest” because</b> during the period of Shiloh they <b>rested from</b> the <b>conquest</b> in the time of Joshua, and it is called <b>“inheritance” because</b> they <b>divided</b> the <b>portions</b> of land among the tribes <b>there, as it is written: “And Joshua divided</b> the land <b>for them, and he cast a lot for them in Shiloh according to the Lord”</b> (Joshua 18:10).",
    "<b>But according to the one,</b> i.e., the school of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>who says this and that</b> are references to <b>Jerusalem, granted</b> that <b>“inheritance”</b> is a reference to Jerusalem, since it is <b>an eternal inheritance. But</b> with regard to <b>“rest,” what rest</b> was there in the Temple in Jerusalem? The Gemara answers: <b>The rest of</b> the <b>Ark, as it is written: And when the ark rested.</b> In other words, verses occasionally refer to the Temple in Jerusalem as the resting place of the Ark.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, <b>who says</b> that <b>this and that</b> are references to <b>Jerusalem,</b> and consequently private altars were forbidden only following the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem, <b>but</b> during the period of the Tabernacle in <b>Shiloh</b> private <b>altars were permitted, this is as it is written: “So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered them upon the rock to the Lord”</b> (Judges 13:19), i.e., he sacrificed them upon a private altar and not in Shiloh.",
    "<b>But according to the one,</b> i.e., the school of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>who says</b> that <b>this and that</b> are references to <b>Shiloh, and</b> private <b>altars were forbidden</b> during this period, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>“So Manoah took,”</b> as it was forbidden to sacrifice offerings outside the Temple? The Gemara answers: Permitting this sacrifice <b>was a provisional edict</b> issued in exigent circumstances.",
    "The Gemara notes that with regard to the disagreement between the <i>tanna’im</i> over the interpretation of the words “rest” and “inheritance,” there is another version of that which <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> which is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, who says</b> that <b>this and that</b> are references to <b>Jerusalem. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is: <b>The man pulled the men,</b> meaning: Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, who is an individual, pulled, i.e., convinced, the members of the school of Rabbi Yishmael to adopt his opinion.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that with regard to <b>all offerings</b> that one consecrated during a period of the permitting of private altars and sacrificed outside their designated area during a period of prohibition of private altars, one is in violation of a positive mitzva and a prohibition, but he is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for sacrificing them. With regard to this, <b>Rav Kahana says: They taught</b> that <b>only with regard to slaughter</b> of these animals outside the designated area is one not liable to receive <i>karet</i>. <b>But with regard to offering up,</b> one would <b>also</b> be <b>liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b>",
    "<b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that</b> immediately following the Torah’s description of an offering that was consecrated during a period of the permitting of private altars <b>the verse states</b> the penalty for sacrificing outside the designated area: <b>“And to them [<i>va’alehem</i>] you shall say”</b> (Leviticus 17:8). The term “<i>alehem</i>,” to them, the first letter of which is the letter <i>aleph</i>, is phonetically similar to the term: <i>Alehem</i>, about them, the first letter of which is the letter <i>ayin</i>. Therefore, the verse can be understood to mean: <b>About that which is</b> written in the <b>adjacent</b> passage <b>you shall say.</b> The preceding passage discusses offerings that were slaughtered outside the Temple, so although there is no penalty of <i>karet</i> for their slaughter, one is liable for <i>karet</i> for sacrificing them upon a private altar.",
    "<b>Rabba objects to this: Is it written: And about them you shall say? “To them” is written, and we read</b> it as <b>“to them.”</b> The verse means that the command should be relayed to Aaron, his sons, and the Jewish people, who are mentioned in the beginning of the passage.",
    "<b>And additionally, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon would say four principles with regard to sacrificial</b> animals: With regard to offerings that one <b>consecrated during a period of prohibition of</b> private <b>altars, and slaughtered and offered up outside</b> their designated area <b>during a period of prohibition of</b> private <b>altars,</b> for <b>these</b> one is <b>in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition, and they carry</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>.</b> With regard to one who <b>consecrated them during a period of</b> the <b>permitting of</b> private <b>altars, and slaughtered and offered</b> them <b>up during a period of prohibition of</b> private <b>altars,</b> for <b>these</b> one is <b>in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition, but they do not carry</b> the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>.</b>",
    "With regard to one who <b>consecrated them during a period of prohibition of</b> private <b>altars, and slaughtered and offered</b> them <b>up outside</b> their designated area <b>during a period of</b> the <b>permitting of</b> private <b>altars,</b> for <b>these</b> one is <b>in</b> violation of <b>a positive mitzva, but</b> one has <b>not</b> violated <b>a prohibition with regard to them.</b>",
    "With regard to one who <b>consecrated them during a period of</b> the <b>permitting of</b> private <b>altars, and slaughtered and offered</b> them <b>up during a period of</b> the <b>permitting of</b> private <b>altars,</b> he is <b>exempt from all</b> violations. The <i>baraita</i> states explicitly that there is no distinction between slaughtering and offering up on a private altar: In both cases, one who consecrated the offering during a period of the permitting of private altars and slaughtered or offered it up during a period of prohibition of private altars is exempt from the punishment of <i>karet</i>. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana,</b> who distinguished between slaughter and offering up, is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And these are the consecrated</b> items, and lists components of the sacrificial service that were performed only on a great public altar, i.e., in the Tabernacle, and not on a private altar. The Gemara clarifies the source of each ritual on the list: The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>placing hands</b> on the head of an offering is <b>as it is written:</b> “If his offering be a burnt offering…he shall bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted <b>before the Lord. And he shall lay</b> his hand upon the head of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 1:3–4).",
    "The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>slaughtering</b> offerings of the most sacred order in the <b>north</b> is <b>as it is written:</b> “And he shall slaughter it on the side of the altar <b>northward before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 1:11). The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>placement</b> of the blood of a burnt offering <b>around,</b> i.e., on all four sides of, the altar, is <b>as it is written: “And</b> Aaron’s sons, the priests, <b>shall…sprinkle</b> the blood <b>roundabout against the altar</b> that is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 1:5).",
    "The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>waving</b> of those offerings that require waving is <b>as it is written: “And the priest</b> shall take one of the lambs, and offer it for a guilt offering, and the <i>log</i> of oil, and <b>wave</b> them for a wave offering <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 14:12). The source for the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>bringing</b> meal offerings to the corner of the altar before the removal of the handful is <b>as it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8). The definite article before the word “altar” indicates that this applies only to the altar in the Tabernacle, and not on a private altar.",
    "§ With regard to the question of whether a meal offering was sacrificed upon an altar outside the Temple, the mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: There is no meal offering</b> sacrificed <b>on an altar</b> outside the Temple, even a great public altar, e.g., the Tabernacle in Gilgal, Nov, and Gibeon. <b>Rav Sheshet says: According to the statement</b> of <b>the one who says there is a meal offering</b> sacrificed <b>on an altar</b> outside the Temple, <b>there are</b> also <b>bird</b> offerings sacrificed <b>on an altar</b> outside the Temple. <b>According to the statement of the one who says there is no meal offering</b> sacrificed <b>on an altar</b> outside the Temple, <b>there are</b> also <b>no bird</b> offerings sacrificed <b>on an altar</b> outside the Temple.",
    "The reason for this is that the Torah is referring to offerings that were sacrificed during the period of the permitting of private altars as: Slaughtered offerings [<i>zevaḥim</i>], in the verse: “And sacrifice them for sacrifices of [<i>vezaveḥu zivḥei</i>] peace offerings” (Leviticus 17:5), from which it may be inferred: <b>Slaughtered offerings but not meal offerings; slaughtered offerings but not bird</b> offerings, i.e., neither meal offerings nor bird offerings were sacrificed on an altar outside the Temple, including a great public altar.",
    "The Gemara continues detailing the distinctions between great public altars and small private altars: <b>And a priest</b> is required only at a public altar, <b>as it is written: “And the priest shall sprinkle</b> the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting” (Leviticus 17:6). Priestly <b>service vestments</b> are required only at a public altar, as it is written: “And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons when they go into the Tent of Meeting or when they come near to the altar <b>to minister in the sacred place”</b> (Exodus 28:43).",
    "<b>And</b> with regard to <b>service vessels,</b> it is written: “And they shall take all the service vessels <b>wherewith they serve in the sacred place”</b> (Numbers 4:12). With regard <b>to a pleasing aroma,</b> i.e., that limbs that had previously been roasted off the altar should not be placed upon the altar, it is required only on a public altar, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the priest shall sprinkle the blood against the altar of the Lord at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and the priest shall make the fat smoke <b>for an aroma pleasing to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 17:6).",
    "<b>A partition for</b> the <b>blood,</b> i.e., the red line that divides the altar, as the blood of some offerings, e.g., a sin offering, was sprinkled above the line, and the blood of other offerings, e.g., a burnt offering, was sprinkled below the line, was required only on a public altar, <b>as it is written: “And the net may reach halfway up the altar”</b> (Exodus 27:5). The definite article before the word “altar” indicates that this applied only to the altar in the Tabernacle. With regard to the requirement for <b>washing of hands</b> and feet before the service, it is required only on a public altar, <b>as it is written:</b> “When they went into the Tent of Meeting <b>and when they came near to the altar, they shall wash”</b> (Exodus 40:32).",
    "§ Concerning the <i>halakha</i> requiring a partition for the blood, and other <i>halakhot</i> that did not apply to a private altar but did apply to a great public altar, <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that there is no requirement for a partition <b>only with regard to</b> consecrated <b>sacrificial</b> items to be used on <b>a small</b> private <b>altar, and which</b> one <b>sacrificed upon a small</b> private <b>altar. But in</b> the case of consecrated <b>sacrificial</b> items to be used on <b>a small</b> private <b>altar that were sacrificed upon a great</b> public <b>altar, there is a partition.</b>",
    "<b>Rabba raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> of waving the <b>breast and</b> the <b>thigh</b> of a peace offering and <b>the <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of a thanks offering applies with regard to sacrificial</b> items <b>of a great</b> public <b>altar and does not apply with regard to sacrificial</b> items <b>of a small</b> private <b>altar,</b> even if they were sacrificed upon a great public altar. The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> that the text of the <i>baraita</i> should be the following: The <i>halakha</i> of waving the breast and thigh and the <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of a thanks offering <b>applies to a great</b> public <b>altar,</b> even with regard to a sacrificial item of a small private altar, <b>but does not apply to a small</b> private <b>altar.</b>",
    "<b>Some say</b> that <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that there is a requirement for a partition <b>only with regard to sacrificial</b> items of <b>a great</b> public <b>altar</b> that <b>were sacrificed upon a great</b> public <b>altar. But in</b> the case of <b>sacrificial</b> items of <b>a small</b> private <b>altar, even though they were sacrificed upon a great</b> public <b>altar, there is no partition.</b>",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of</b> Rami bar Ḥama: Waving of the <b>breast and thigh</b> of a peace offering <b>and the <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of a thanks offering applies to sacrificial</b> items <b>of a great</b> public <b>altar, and does not apply to sacrificial</b> items <b>of a small</b> private <b>altar.</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: No proof may be brought from here, as <b>I will say</b> that it means the <i>halakha</i> of waving the breast and thigh and the <i>teruma</i> of the loaves of a thanks offering <b>applies to a great</b> public <b>altar,</b> even with regard to the sacrificial items of a private altar, <b>and does not apply to a small</b> private <b>altar.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this latter version of Rami bar Ḥama’s statement <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: A burnt offering of a private altar that one brought inside,</b> i.e., into the area of a great public altar, is <b>absorbed,</b> i.e., sanctified, by the <b>partitions for all matters.</b>",
    "With regard to the previous matter, <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a burnt offering of a private altar</b>"
