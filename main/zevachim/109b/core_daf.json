    "<b>or</b> from which there remains only <b>an olive-bulk of</b> sacrificial portions, e.g., <b>fat</b> to be burned on the altar, one still <b>sprinkles the blood</b> of the offering on the altar and one thereby fulfills his obligation.",
    "But if all that remains is <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of fat, one may not sprinkle the blood,</b> as since the meat and the sacrificial portions are used differently, the former being eaten and the latter being burned on the altar, they cannot combine to form the minimum requirement of an olive-bulk. This applies only to offerings whose meat is eaten. <b>But for a burnt offering,</b> even if all that remains is <b>half an olive-bulk of flesh and half an olive-bulk of fat, one sprinkles the blood, because</b> since the offering is <b>consumed</b> upon the altar <b>in its entirety,</b> all of its parts combine together. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a meal offering, even if all of it</b> still <b>exists, one does not sprinkle</b> the blood. It is apparent that Rabbi Yehoshua’s opinion in this <i>baraita</i> is the one expressed in the <i>baraita</i>.",
    "The Gemara clarifies the final clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the relevance of a meal offering</b> to the sprinkling of blood? In a meal offering there is no blood at all. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations that accompany</b> an animal <b>offering.</b> If the entire body of the offering was destroyed but the meal offering that accompanied it remains, one might have thought that it would be sufficient to allow for the sprinkling of the blood. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that this is incorrect.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the handful</b> of a meal offering, <b>the frankincense, the incense, the meal offering of priests, the meal offering of</b> the <b>anointed priest, and the meal offering</b> brought with the <b>libations</b> that accompany animal offerings, in a case <b>where one sacrificed</b> even <b>an olive-bulk from</b> any <b>one of these,</b> which should be sacrificed on the altar, <b>outside</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable,</b> as the burning of an olive-bulk is considered a proper burning. <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>exempt unless he sacrifices the whole of</b> any one of these items outside the Temple. <b>But</b> Rabbi Eliezer concedes that with regard to <b>any of them that one sacrificed inside</b> the courtyard <b>but left over an olive-bulk from them and</b> then <b>sacrificed that</b> olive-bulk <b>outside</b> the courtyard, he is <b>liable.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> with regard to <b>any of these</b> offerings <b>that were lacking any amount,</b> if <b>one sacrifices it outside</b> the courtyard, he is <b>exempt.</b>",
    "<b>One who sacrifices sacrificial</b> meat, which is eaten, <b>and sacrificial portions,</b> i.e., those that are to be burned on the altar, <b>outside</b> the courtyard, is <b>liable</b> for the sacrifice of the sacrificial portions. But he is not liable for sacrificing the meat.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Each morning and afternoon, a <i>peras</i>, i.e., half a <i>maneh</i>, of incense must be burned in the Sanctuary. Nevertheless, <b>one who burns</b> only <b>an olive-bulk</b> of incense <b>outside</b> the courtyard is <b>liable.</b> If one burns <b>half a <i>peras</i> inside</b> the Temple, he is <b>exempt.</b>",
    "The Gemara addresses the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>It enters our mind</b> to explain: <b>What</b> is meant by: He is <b>exempt?</b> It means that <b>a non-priest,</b> for whom it is prohibited to perform the sacrificial rites in the Temple, is <b>exempt</b> if he burns incense inside the Temple. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Why</b> should he be exempt; this <b>is</b> an act of <b>sacrificial burning?</b> Even though he burned less than a <i>peras</i>, it is apparent from the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> that burning even an olive-bulk is considered an act of sacrificial burning.",
    "<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya, son of Abba, said</b> that <b>Rav said: What</b> is meant by: He is <b>exempt?</b> It means that if a priest burns half a <i>peras</i> inside the Temple, the <b>community</b> is thereby <b>exempt</b> from its obligation to burn incense despite the fact that less than the required amount was burned.",
    "<b>Rabbi Zeira said: If</b> there is something <b>difficult for me</b> with regard to this <i>baraita</i>, <b>this</b> is <b>difficult for me: That which Rav said concerning</b> this <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that if a priest burns less than a <i>peras</i> of incense the community fulfills its obligation, <b>even Rabbi Eliezer concedes.</b> Rabbi Zeira explains: This is difficult for me <b>as Rabbi Eliezer</b> rules in the mishna that one who burns an olive-bulk of incense outside is exempt. Effectively, he is <b>saying</b> that burning less than the required amount <b>is not</b> an act of <b>sacrificial burning.</b> How then can he hold that the community fulfills its obligation by the burning of less than a <i>peras</i>?",
    "<b>Rabba said: With regard to</b> the <b>burning of</b> incense designated to be burned in the <b>Sanctuary</b> upon the golden altar, <b>everyone,</b> i.e., the Rabbis and Rabbi Eliezer, <b>agrees</b> that the Torah does not specify the amount to be burned; the requirement to burn a <i>peras</i> is rabbinic. Accordingly, the obligation is fulfilled even if only an olive-bulk of incense is burned there, as the <i>baraita</i> states, and one who burns an olive-bulk of that incense outside the Temple is liable.",
    "<b>When they disagree</b> in the mishna, it is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>burning of</b> incense in the <b>inner</b> sanctum, i.e., in the Holy of Holies, on Yom Kippur. Concerning that obligation, the verse states: “And he shall take…his handful of sweet incense, beaten small, and bring it within the Curtain” (Leviticus 16:12). <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>“his handful”</b> indicates that <b>specifically</b> that measure must be burned in order to fulfill the obligation. Accordingly, he also holds that one who burns only an olive-bulk of that incense outside the courtyard is exempt. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>“his handful”</b> does <b>not</b> indicate that <b>specifically</b> that measure must be burned, and the obligation can be fulfilled even with a lesser amount. Accordingly, they also hold that one who burns even an olive-bulk of that incense outside the courtyard is liable.",
    "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>But when</b> the term <b>“statute” is written</b> with regard to the Yom Kippur Temple service (see Leviticus 16:29), <b>it is</b> also <b>written with regard to</b> the <b>burning of</b> incense in the <b>inner</b> sanctum. The term “statute” stated with regard to a rite indicates that it is valid only if performed precisely in accordance with all the details mentioned in the Torah concerning it. Accordingly, the term “his handful” must be specific.",
    "<b>Rather, Abaye said: With regard to</b> the <b>burning</b> of incense <b>in</b> the <b>inner</b> sanctum, i.e., in the Holy of Holies, on Yom Kippur, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the obligation is only fulfilled if a handful of incense is burned. Also, everyone agrees with regard to burning incense in the Sanctuary that the obligation is fulfilled even with an olive-bulk, as the <i>baraita</i> states, and one who burns an olive-bulk of incense outside the Temple is liable.",
    "<b>When they disagree</b> in the mishna, it is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>burning of</b> incense of the Holy of Holies <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard. One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>we derive</b> the measure for liability for incense of the <b>inner</b> sanctum <b>from</b> incense of the <b>outer</b> sanctum, i.e., the Sanctuary. Just as for the latter one is liable for an olive-bulk, so too, for the former one is liable for an olive-bulk. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not derive</b> one from the other. Rather, since the obligation inside the Holy of Holies is fulfilled only with a handful of incense, one is liable for burning that incense outside the Temple only if he burns that amount.",
    "<b>Rava said</b> in rejection of Abaye’s understanding: <b>Now,</b> if <b>the Rabbis do not derive</b> the measure for liability for offering up outside the Temple courtyard, with regard to other rites performed in the <b>outer</b> sanctum, <b>from</b> incense of the <b>outer</b> sanctum, is it <b>necessary</b> to question whether they would derive the measure for liability for incense of the <b>inner</b> sanctum <b>from</b> incense of the <b>outer</b> sanctum? Certainly, they would not.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the rite that Rava is referring to in his response to Abaye? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one who offers up</b> outside the courtyard <b>less than an olive-bulk of</b> the <b>handful</b> taken from a meal offering <b>or less than an olive-bulk of</b> the <b>sacrificial portions, or who pours as a libation</b> outside the courtyard <b>less than three <i>log</i> of wine</b> or who pours as a libation on <i>Sukkot</i> <b>less than three <i>log</i> of water,</b> that <b>he would be liable.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states:</b> “And he will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, <b>to sacrifice</b> it” (Leviticus 17:9). The term “to sacrifice it” indicates that one is <b>liable for the</b> sacrifice of <b>a complete</b> offering outside the courtyard <b>but one is not liable for the</b> sacrifice of <b>an incomplete</b> offering outside.",
    "The Gemara explains Rava’s inference: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that for a libation of <b>less than three <i>log</i></b> outside the courtyard one is exempt despite the fact <b>that</b> the libation still <b>contains a few olive-bulks. And</b> it is apparent then, that <b>the Rabbis do not derive</b> the measure for liability for the rite of libation that should be performed in the <b>outer</b> sanctum <b>from</b> incense that should be burned in the <b>outer</b> sanctum. Certainly then, they would not derive the measure for liability for incense of the inner sanctum from incense of the outer sanctum.",
    "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> to resolve Rabbi Zeira’s difficulty: Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis agree with regard to the incense of the Sanctuary, that the Torah does not specify an amount to be burned, and the community fulfills its obligation even if only an olive-bulk is burned, as is taught in the <i>baraita</i>. When they disagree in the mishna, it is in a case <b>where, for example, one designated two half-<i>peras</i></b> portions of incense, in accordance with the rabbinic requirement to burn one <i>peras</i>,"
