    "<b>And although two</b> of these distinctions <b>are not precise,</b> the other <b>two are in any event precise</b> distinctions, based upon which a distinction can be drawn.",
    "The Gemara explains why two of the distinctions are not precise: <b>What is different</b> about <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner,</b> such <b>that its disqualification does not concern</b> the offering <b>itself?</b> It is that this <b>merely</b> constitutes a change of <b>thought. Deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering is also merely</b> a change of <b>thought;</b> the offering is not physically affected. <b>Rather,</b> this distinction between deviation with regard to the owner and deviation from the type of offering is false; one should claim that if deviation from the type of offering <b>disqualifies it once</b> the one who slaughtered it <b>had</b> that <b>intent, here too, once</b> the one who slaughtered it <b>had intent</b> to deviate from its owner, <b>he disqualified it.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains the difficulty with the second distinction, the case where the owner died: <b>And according to Rav Pineḥas, son of Rav Mari, who says</b> that disqualification by <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner applies</b> even <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>death,</b> there is no distinction in this regard between deviation from the type of offering and deviation with regard to the owner. <b>In any event, there are two</b> remaining distinctions based on which the comparison between a deviation from the type of offering and a deviation with regard to the owner <b>can be refuted.</b>",
    "<b>Rather, Rav Ashi says</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to sprinkle the blood for the sake of one other than the owner is derived from a verse. <b>The verse states: “And it shall be accepted for him to atone for him”</b> (Leviticus 1:4), teaching that the sacrificial rite that atones for the owner, namely, the sprinkling of the blood, must be performed specifically for him, <b>and not for another.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But does this</b> verse <b>come to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>? Isn’t <b>it necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: <b>“And it shall be accepted for him to atone for him [<i>alav</i>],” Rabbi Shimon says:</b> This indicates that in a case where one consecrated an animal as an offering and it died or was lost, if it was initially incumbent <b>upon him [<i>alav</i>]</b> to bring an offering, i.e., if he had accepted upon himself a personal obligation to bring an offering, <b>he bears responsibility for it,</b> i.e., he is obligated to bring another offering in its stead. <b>But</b> if it was <b>not</b> incumbent <b>upon him [<i>alav</i>]</b> to bring an offering, i.e., if he consecrated a specific animal without accepting upon himself any personal obligation, <b>he does not bear responsibility for it</b> if it dies or is lost.",
    "<b>And Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says: What is the reasoning</b> behind this distinction? <b>Once</b> a person <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring an offering, it is considered <b>as though</b> the offering is <b>loaded upon his shoulders.</b> He does not discharge his obligation until he brings some offering.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ashi says</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to sprinkle the blood for the sake of one other than the owner is derived <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“And it shall be accepted for him,”</b> not from the term “for him,” on which the <i>baraita</i> is based.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>slaughter and</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood must be performed for the sake of the owner. <b>From where do we</b> derive that the <b>collection</b> of the blood must also be performed for the sake of the owner?",
    "<b>And if you would say: Let us derive from slaughter and sprinkling</b> that collection must also be performed for the sake of the owner, this derivation can be refuted: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about slaughter and sprinkling?</b> They are unique <b>in that</b> each is <b>a rite for which one is liable</b> to be punished with death at the hand of Heaven if he performs it <b>outside</b> the Temple.",
    "<b>Rather, Rav Ashi says</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that the collection of the blood must also be performed for the sake of the owner <b>is derived from</b> the case of <b>a nazirite’s ram. As it is written: “And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of peace offerings</b> unto the Lord” (Numbers 6:17), indicating <b>that its offering should be</b> performed <b>for the sake of a peace offering. And if</b> the verse <b>is not</b> necessary for the <b>matter of deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering, as we derived that from there,</b> i.e., the verses cited earlier (4a), <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner.</b> It is thereby derived that its sacrificial rites must be performed for the sake of its owner.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba said to Rava,</b> in objection to this derivation: <b>Say</b> that the term: <b>“Shall offer,” is a generalization</b> and: <b>“A sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>],” is a detail.</b> According to the principles of biblical hermeneutics, where there is <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization includes only that which is</b> specified <b>in the detail.</b> Accordingly, <b>slaughter [<i>zeviḥa</i>], yes,</b> must be performed for the sake of its owner; but <b>no other</b> rite must be performed for the sake of its owner in order for the offering to be fit.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it had been <b>written: Shall offer</b> the ram <b>for peace offerings as a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>],</b> it would be <b>as you say.</b> The clause: Shall offer the ram for peace offerings, would be considered a generalization, and: Sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>], would be a detail. <b>Now that it is written: “Shall offer</b> the ram <b>for a sacrifice [<i>zevaḥ</i>] of peace offerings,”</b> the term “shall offer” is <b>an incomplete generalization,</b> as the term “for a sacrifice” interrupts between “shall offer” and “peace offerings.” <b>And one cannot derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from <b>any incomplete generalization by</b> employing the principle of <b>a generalization and a detail.</b>",
    "<b>Ravina says</b> there is a different answer: <b>Actually, one can derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> from verses with incomplete generalizations using the principle of a generalization and a detail. <b>And</b> the reason this <i>halakha</i> applies to other rites besides slaughter is that by adding the term <b>“unto the Lord,”</b> it <b>then makes a generalization.</b>",
    "Before Ravina concluded his interpretation, <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: But the former generalization is dissimilar to the latter generalization. The former generalization includes</b> only the essential sacrificial <b>actions and nothing more,</b> whereas <b>the latter generalization</b> includes <b>any</b> sacrificial duty <b>unto the Lord, and even pouring</b> the <b>remains</b> of the blood on the base of the altar <b>and burning</b> the <b>sacrificial portions</b> of the offering on the altar. Ravina responded: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught generalizations and details in cases like this.</b>",
    "Ravina concludes his explanation: Since the term: “Unto the Lord,” is another generalization, the verse is formulated as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the</b> mentioned <b>detail,</b> slaughter, is <b>defined</b> as an essential <b>rite and we require</b> that it be performed <b>for the sake of</b> the owner, <b>so too, we require</b> that <b>every</b> essential <b>rite</b> be performed <b>for the sake of</b> the owner.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the verse is referring only to actions similar to the detail, not all of the essential rites are necessarily included. Perhaps it should be derived that <b>just as the</b> mentioned <b>detail,</b> slaughter, is <b>defined</b> as an essential <b>rite, and one is liable</b> to be punished with death at the hand of Heaven <b>for</b> performing <b>it outside</b> the Temple, <b>so too, any</b> essential <b>rite</b> for which <b>one is liable</b> to be punished with death at the hand of Heaven <b>for</b> performing <b>it outside</b> the Temple is included in the verse. Accordingly, <b>slaughter and sprinkling</b> the blood <b>are</b> included, but <b>collection</b> of the blood <b>and conveying</b> it are <b>not.</b>",
    "<b>Alternatively,</b> it could be derived that <b>just as the</b> item mentioned in the <b>detail</b> is clearly <b>defined</b> as <b>an action that requires</b> performance in the <b>north</b> of the Temple courtyard <b>and is</b> performed <b>in the</b> sacrifice of <b>inner sin offerings, so too, any</b> rite <b>that requires</b> performance in the <b>north and is</b> performed <b>in the</b> sacrifice of <b>inner sin offerings</b> is included in the <i>halakha</i>. Accordingly, <b>slaughter and collection are</b> included; <b>sprinkling</b> the blood is <b>not.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: Both possibilities are equally valid; <b>this</b> derivation <b>can be said and that</b> derivation <b>can be said.</b> Either collection or sprinkling might be included in the <i>halakha</i>. Consequently, <b>they are equal, and</b> therefore <b>both are included.</b> Or according to <b>another version</b> of the Gemara’s answer, they are equal, <b>and</b> therefore <b>each one,</b> i.e., both collection and sprinkling, <b>shall stand in</b> its <b>status.</b>",
    "The Gemara provides an alternative answer: <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that <b>sprinkling is derived from</b> the verse <b>that Rav Ashi</b> cited: “And it shall be accepted for him to atone for him.” Therefore, when the verse states: “And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the Lord,” indicating the inclusion of rites similar to slaughter, it is apparently referring not to sprinkling but to collection.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a nazirite’s ram</b> must be sacrificed for the sake of its owner. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this <i>halakha</i> applies with regard to <b>other peace offerings</b> as well?",
    "<b>And if you would say: Let us derive from a nazirite’s ram</b> that all peace offerings must be sacrificed for the sake of their owners, this derivation can be refuted: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a nazirite’s ram?</b> It is unique <b>in that there is other blood,</b> i.e., there are other offerings, a sin offering and a burnt offering, that must be brought by a nazirite together <b>with</b> his ram.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If that is so,</b> if this <i>halakha</i> is unique to a nazirite’s ram, <b>let</b> the verse <b>write: His peace offerings [<i>shelamav</i>]. What</b> is indicated by writing <b>“peace offerings [<i>shelamim</i>]”?</b> It is written <b>to include all</b> types of <b>peace offerings.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a peace offering</b> must be sacrificed for its own sake and for the sake of its owner. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this <i>halakha</i> applies with regard to <b>all other offerings?</b>",
    "<b>And if you would say: Let us derive from a peace offering</b> that all offerings must be sacrificed with these intentions, this derivation can be refuted: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a peace offering?</b> It is unique <b>in that it requires placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>and</b> it is accompanied by <b>libations, and</b> it requires the <b>waving of</b> the <b>breast and</b> the right <b>hind leg</b> by the priest and owner together. No other offering possesses all three of these requirements.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the guilt offering, and of the consecration offering, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings”</b> (Leviticus 7:37). <b>The verse juxtaposes</b> all types of offerings <b>with peace offerings,</b> indicating that <b>just as we require</b> the sacrifice of <b>a peace offering</b> to be performed <b>for its sake, both</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering and</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner, so too, we require</b> the sacrifice of <b>every</b> type of offering to be performed <b>for its sake, both</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> from the type of <b>offering and</b> concerning <b>deviation</b> with regard to the <b>owner.</b>",
    "§ Having established the source for the requirement to sacrifice offerings with the rightful owner and the specific type of offering in mind, the Gemara inquires: Why not <b>say</b> that in a case <b>where</b> one <b>slaughtered them not for their sake, they are disqualified?</b> Why, according to the mishna, do they remain fit?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states: “That which has gone out of your lips you shall observe and do; according to what you have vowed [<i>nadarta</i>]</b> freely [<i>nedava</i>] to the Lord your God, that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). The Gemara interprets the words <i>nadarta</i> and <i>nedava</i> exegetically: How can the offering mentioned in <b>this</b> verse be <b>a gift</b> offering <b>[<i>nedava</i>]? It is</b> already referred to as <b>a vow</b> offering <b>[<i>neder</i>]. Rather,</b> the verse indicates that <b>if you did what you had vowed</b> to do, i.e., sacrificed your vow offering properly, <b>it shall be</b> a satisfactory <b>vow</b> offering; <b>but if</b> you did <b>not</b> sacrifice it properly, <b>it shall be</b> rendered a voluntary <b>gift</b> offering. Although it does not satisfy the obligation of your vow, it remains a valid offering.",
    "<b>And it was necessary</b> for the Torah to include the verse: <b>“That which has gone out of your lips,” and it was necessary</b> to include the verse: <b>“This is the law.” As, had the Merciful One written</b> in the Torah only the verse: <b>“That which has gone out</b> of your lips,” <b>I would say</b>"
