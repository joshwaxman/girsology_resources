    "<b>Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> The slope of <b>each</b> of the <b>minor ramps,</b> was <b>one cubit</b> of rise <b>per three cubits</b> of run; this was true <b>aside from the</b> main <b>ramp of the altar, which</b> rose one cubit in <b>three and a half cubits and one fingerbreadth and one-third of a fingerbreadth,</b> measured <b>by the tip</b> of the thumb. The slope of the main ramp of the altar was slightly less than that of the minor ramps in order to make it easier for the priests to ascend the ramp while holding the sacrificial portions.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Handfuls were removed from the meal offerings in any place in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard and were consumed within</b> the area enclosed by <b>the curtains by males of the priesthood,</b> prepared <b>in any</b> form of <b>food</b> preparation that he chooses, e.g., roasted or boiled, <b>for</b> one <b>day and night, until midnight.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar says: A meal offering that had its handful removed in the Sanctuary</b> is <b>valid, as we found with regard to</b> the <b>removal of</b> the two <b>bowls</b> of frankincense that were placed beside the shewbread on the Table, which was located in the Sanctuary. On Shabbat, these bowls of frankincense were removed and burned on the altar, which allowed the shewbread to be eaten. Removal of the bowls of frankincense paralleled the process of removing a handful from a meal offering; just as the removal of the bowls took place in the Sanctuary, so could the removal of a handful of the meal offering be done in the Sanctuary.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the meal offerings: “And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests; <b>and he shall take from there</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:2). The term “from there” indicates that the handful must be taken <b>from a place where the feet of the non-priest</b> who brought the meal offering may <b>stand,</b> i.e., the Temple courtyard, but not the Sanctuary, in direct contradiction to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Ben Beteira says</b> there is a different explanation of the verse. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the priest <b>removed a handful with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>that he should return</b> the handful to the vessel <b>and</b> then <b>remove</b> another <b>handful with</b> his <b>right</b> hand? <b>The verse states:</b> “And he shall take <b>from there</b> his handful,” indicating that he may take it <b>from the place where he already removed a handful.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raises the objection and he resolves it,</b> and <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Taḥlifa: I will explain to you</b> the solution. The verse that indicates that the handful is taken from a place where non-priests may stand <b>is necessary only to render the entire</b> Temple <b>courtyard valid</b> for removing the handful, but not to indicate that one may not take the handful in the Sanctuary.",
    "This was necessary because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since a burnt offering</b> is one of the <b>offerings of the most sacred order, and a meal offering</b> is also one of the <b>offerings of the most sacred order, just as a burnt offering requires</b> slaughter specifically in the <b>north</b> side of the Temple courtyard, <b>so too, a meal offering requires</b> the taking of the handful specifically in the <b>north</b> side of the Temple courtyard.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a burnt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is <b>completely</b> burned upon the altar. Therefore, one would not have derived that just as a burnt offering must be slaughtered in the north side of the Temple courtyard, the handful must be taken from a meal offering in the north side of the Temple courtyard.",
    "And if one would attempt to derive that the handful of a meal offering must be taken in the north side of the Temple courtyard <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to <b>a sin offering,</b> which is an offering of the most sacred order whose slaughtering must take place in the north side, yet is not completely consumed upon the altar, this too can be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a sin offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that it atones for those liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b>",
    "And if one would attempt to derive that the handful of a meal-offering must be taken in the north side of the Temple courtyard <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to <b>a guilt offering,</b> which is an offering of the most sacred order that must be slaughtered in the north, and that does not share the unique characteristics of the burnt offering or sin offering, this too can be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a guilt offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is one of the <b>types of</b> offerings whose sacrificial rites are performed with their <b>blood,</b> which is not so with regard to a meal offering.",
    "The Gemara adds: It also cannot be suggested to draw an analogy <b>from</b> the common element shared by <b>all of the</b> offerings mentioned above. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about all of them?</b> They are notable <b>in that</b> they are all <b>types of</b> offerings whose sacrificial rites are performed with their <b>blood.</b>",
    "The Gemara presents a different answer: <b>Rather, it was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach that the handful may be taken from the meal offering anywhere in the Temple courtyard because it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it is written: “And he shall bring it to the altar”</b> (Leviticus 2:8), and then it states: <b>“And he shall take up from there his handful”</b> (Leviticus 6:8), indicating that the handful must be taken from the vessel in which the meal offering was brought near the altar, that the verses also indicate that the handful must be taken in the place where the vessel is brought near the altar.",
    "Therefore, <b>just as</b> one must <b>bring</b> the meal offering <b>to</b> the <b>southwest corner</b> of the altar, <b>so too,</b> the <b>removal of</b> its <b>handful</b> must take place <b>at</b> the <b>southwest corner</b> of the altar. To counter this, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the removal of the handful may take place anywhere in the Temple courtyard.",
    "§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Peace offerings that one slaughtered in the Sanctuary are valid, as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter it at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), i.e., in the courtyard; <b>and</b> the courtyard, which is of <b>secondary</b> sanctity, <b>should not be weightier than the</b> place of <b>primary</b> sanctity. Accordingly, as the offering is valid if it was slaughtered in the courtyard, it is certainly valid if it was slaughtered in the Sanctuary.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if gentiles surrounded the entire</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> and were attacking, making it impossible for the priests to remain there, <b>the priests may enter that area,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary, <b>and eat the offerings of the most sacred order there? The verse states: “In a most holy place shall you eat it”</b> (Numbers 18:10).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is there a need to derive the <i>halakha</i> from this source? <b>Let us say</b> that it can be derived from the verse: <b>“In the court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it”</b> (Leviticus 6:9), <b>and</b> the place of <b>secondary</b> sanctity <b>should not be weightier than the</b> place of <b>primary</b> sanctity. Therefore, similar to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, if the sacrificial food can be eaten in the courtyard, it can certainly be eaten in the Sanctuary. The fact that the <i>baraita</i> requires another source indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s method of derivation is not valid.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to slaughtering offerings, the act of slaughter is a sacrificial <b>rite,</b> and <b>a person serves in the presence of his master.</b> Therefore, <b>we say</b> that the place of <b>secondary</b> sanctity <b>should not be weightier than the</b> place of <b>primary</b> sanctity, and if one can slaughter an offering in the courtyard, he can certainly do so in the Sanctuary. By contrast, in the case of <b>eating</b> sacrificial food, <b>which</b> is different because <b>a person does not eat in the presence of his master, we do not say</b> the rationale that the place of <b>secondary</b> sanctity <b>should not be weightier than the</b> place of <b>primary</b> sanctity. Therefore, a verse was required to teach that the priest may partake of the offerings in the Sanctuary.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The sacrificial rite of <b>a bird sin offering would be performed at</b> the <b>southwest corner</b> of the altar. <b>And</b> if its sacrificial rite was performed <b>in any place</b> on the altar, the offering <b>was</b> deemed <b>valid; but that</b> corner <b>was its</b> designated <b>place. And</b> there were <b>three matters</b> for which the portion of <b>that corner below</b> the red line that served as the demarcation between the upper and lower portions of the altar <b>served</b> as the proper location, <b>and</b> there were <b>three</b> matters for which the portion of that corner <b>above</b> the red line served as their proper location. The following rites were performed <b>below</b> the red line: Sacrificing <b>a bird sin offering, and bringing</b> meal offerings <b>near</b> the altar before removal of the handful, <b>and</b> pouring out <b>the remaining blood.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> the following rites were performed <b>above</b> the red line: <b>The wine libation</b> that is brought together with animal offerings or as an offering by itself, <b>and the water</b> libation on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>and</b> sacrificing <b>a bird burnt offering when</b> they were <b>numerous</b> and it was impossible to perform the rite <b>in the east,</b> i.e., the southeastern corner where the bird burnt offering was sacrificed.",
    "<b>All</b> those <b>who ascend</b> the ramp <b>to the altar ascend via</b> the <b>right</b> side of the ramp toward the southeast corner"
