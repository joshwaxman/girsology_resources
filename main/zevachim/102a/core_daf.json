    "<b>and a non-priest may not inspect the</b> shades of leprous <b>marks</b> to diagnose them. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>Aaron quarantined her,</b> that is difficult, as <b>Aaron</b> was <b>a relative,</b> Miriam’s brother, <b>and a relative may not inspect the</b> shades of leprous <b>marks. Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, bestowed a great honor on Miriam at that time,</b> and said: <b>I</b> Myself <b>am a priest, and I</b> will <b>quarantine her</b> for seven days to see if the shades of leprous marks persist, and <b>I</b> will <b>declare her</b> a leper if she is impure, <b>and I</b> will <b>exempt her</b> if she is not impure.",
    "<b>In any event,</b> the midrash <b>teaches: Moses</b> was <b>a non-priest, and a non-priest may not inspect the</b> shades of leprous <b>marks,</b> which contradicts the statement of Rav that Moses was a priest.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of the examination of <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks are different, because</b> specifically <b>Aaron and his sons,</b> and not Moses, <b>are written in the passage</b> that discusses them: “Then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests” (Leviticus 13:2). Therefore, there is no proof from this <i>baraita</i> that Moses was not a priest.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Elisheva,</b> the daughter of Amminadav and the wife of Aaron, <b>had five more</b> reasons for <b>joy than</b> the other <b>daughters of Israel</b> on the day the Tabernacle was dedicated: <b>Her brother-in-law,</b> Moses, was <b>a king; her husband,</b> Aaron, was the <b>High Priest; her son,</b> Elazar, was the <b>deputy</b> High Priest; <b>her son’s son,</b> Pinehas, was the priest <b>anointed for war,</b> who would lead the army out to battle; <b>and her brother,</b> Nahshon, son of Amminadav, was <b>the prince of</b> the <b>tribe</b> of Judah, who brought his offering on that day, as the first of all the princes. <b>But</b> on that same day of joy she was <b>in mourning for her two sons,</b> Nadav and Avihu, who died on that day.",
    "<b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Her brother-in-law,</b> Moses, was <b>a king.</b> From this one can infer that <b>yes,</b> he was <b>a king,</b> but he was <b>not a High Priest,</b> contrary to Rav’s statement. The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means: Moses was <b>a king as well,</b> in addition to being a High Priest.",
    "The Gemara comments: The question of whether Moses was a High Priest is <b>subject to</b> a dispute among <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: When Moses was at the burning bush and expressed hesitation to deliver God’s message to Pharaoh, the verse states: <b>“And the anger of the Lord burned against Moses,</b> and He said: Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in his heart” (Exodus 4:14). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> For <b>every burning anger that</b> is stated <b>in the Torah, its effect is</b> also <b>stated,</b> i.e., the Torah records an action or pronouncement as a consequence of that anger, <b>but</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>no effect of</b> the anger <b>is stated.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: Even in this</b> case the anger’s <b>effect is stated, as it is stated</b> there: <b>“Is there not Aaron your brother the Levite?</b> I know that he can speak well.” <b>But isn’t</b> Aaron <b>a priest?</b> Why is he referred to as a Levite? <b>This</b> is what God <b>is saying</b> to Moses: <b>I</b> initially <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> would be the <b>priest and he</b> would be the <b>Levite; now he</b> will be the <b>priest and you</b> will be the <b>Levite.</b>",
    "<b>And the Rabbis say: Moses became a priest</b> for <b>the seven days of inauguration alone,</b> and after that his priesthood expired. <b>And some say:</b> The <b>priesthood expired only for the descendants of Moses,</b> but Moses himself remained a priest, <b>as it is stated: “But as for Moses the man of God, his sons are named among the tribe of Levi”</b> (I Chronicles 23:14). This verse indicates that it was his sons who were Levites, but he himself remained a priest. <b>And</b> so too the verse <b>states: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among them that call upon His name,</b> did call upon the Lord, and He answered them” (Psalms 99:6).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>And</b> so too the verse <b>states?</b> Why did the <i>tanna</i> need to cite a second proof? The Gemara explains: <b>And if you would say</b> the first verse <b>is written only for</b> future <b>generations,</b> to include Moses’ descendants in the tribe of Levi but not to exclude him, then there is a second proof: <b>And</b> so too, the verse <b>states: “Moses and Aaron among His priests.”</b> The statement of Rav that Moses was a High Priest is in accordance with the opinion in this <i>baraita</i>.",
    "The Gemara challenges the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: <b>And</b> is it true that for <b>every burning anger that</b> is stated <b>in the Torah, its effect is</b> also <b>stated? But isn’t it written</b> with regard to Moses: <b>“And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger”</b> (Exodus 11:8)? <b>And</b> Moses <b>did not say anything to</b> Pharaoh. <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> Moses <b>slapped him and left.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>And does Reish Lakish</b> actually <b>say this? But isn’t it written:</b> “Go unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goes out unto the water; <b>and you shall stand by the river’s brink to meet him,</b> and the rod which was turned to a serpent shall you take in your hand” (Exodus 7:15); <b>and Reish Lakish says:</b> God meant: Pharaoh <b>is a king, and</b> so you should <b>be amiable toward him, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> God meant: Pharaoh <b>is wicked, and</b> so you should <b>be insolent toward him.</b> If according to Reish Lakish Moses was commanded to greet Pharaoh with respect, how could he say that Moses slapped Pharaoh? The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the names of the Sages in this dispute; it is Reish Lakish who says that Moses was commanded to be insolent.",
    "With regard to the respect accorded to a king, <b>Rabbi Yannai says: Fear of</b> the <b>kingship should always be upon you,</b> even when the king does not deserve respect, <b>as it is written</b> that Moses said to Pharaoh: <b>“And all these your servants shall come down unto me</b> and bow down unto me, saying: Get you out, and all the people that follow you, and after that I will go out” (Exodus 11:8). He mentioned Pharaoh’s servants, <b>but he did not say</b> this <b>of</b> Pharaoh <b>himself,</b> even though this was the eventual outcome. Rather, he spoke to Pharaoh with the respect due to a king.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Derive the principle <b>from here: “And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he girded up his loins and ran before Ahab</b> to the entrance of Jezreel” (I Kings 18:46). Elijah the prophet ran before the evil king Ahab out of respect.",
    "The Gemara continues to discuss the roles of Moses: <b>Ulla says: Moses requested</b> that he be given the <b>kingship, but it was not given to him, as it is written: “Do not draw hither”</b> (Exodus 3:5); <b>and</b> the word <b>“hither”</b> refers to <b>nothing other than kingship, as it is stated:</b> “Then David the king went in and sat before the Lord, and he said: <b>Who am I, O Lord God,</b> and what is my house, <b>that You have brought me hither”?</b> (II Samuel 7:18).",
    "<b>Rava raises an objection</b> from the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> Elisheva’s <b>brother-in-law,</b> Moses, was <b>a king.</b> This teaches that Moses was in fact granted kingship. <b>Rava said:</b> Ulla <b>is saying</b> that Moses did not receive kingship <b>for himself and for his descendants,</b> i.e., it was not bequeathed to his sons.",
    "The Gemara counters: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>anywhere that it is written “hither”</b> the verse <b>is</b> referring to kingship <b>for</b> future <b>generations</b> as well? <b>But isn’t it written about</b> the kingship of <b>Saul:</b> “They asked of the Lord further: <b>Is there yet a man who comes hither”</b> (I Samuel 10:22), and Saul was <b>indeed</b> a king, but <b>his descendants</b> were <b>not.</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>If you wish, say: There was Ish-Bosheth,</b> Saul’s son, who was a king (see II Samuel 2:10), indicating that Saul’s kingship did pass to his son. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Saul is different, because</b> the kingship <b>did not stand even for himself,</b> and this is why it did not pass on to his descendants.",
    "The second response is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: When greatness is apportioned to a person</b> in Heaven, it <b>is apportioned to him and to his descendants until the end of all generations, as it is stated: “He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous; but with kings upon the throne</b> He sets them forever, and they are exalted” (Job 36:7). <b>But if he</b> then <b>became arrogant, the Holy One, Blessed be He, humiliates him, as is stated</b> in the next verse: <b>“And if they be bound in fetters, and be held in cords of affliction”</b> (Job 36:8). This was the case with Saul.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Blemished</b> priests, <b>whether</b> they are temporarily <b>blemished</b> or permanently blemished, receive a share and partake of offerings, but do not sacrifice them. The Gemara explains: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the meal offering: <b>“Every male</b> among the sons of Aaron shall eat it” (Leviticus 6:11). The phrase “every male” serves <b>to include blemished</b> priests.",
    "The Gemara clarifies: <b>For what</b> matter is this derivation necessary? <b>If</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>consumption, it is already stated</b> explicitly: “Any man of the seed of Aaron the priest who has a blemish…<b>He may eat the bread of his God, of the most sacred,</b> and of the sacred” (Leviticus 21:21–22). <b>Rather,</b> Leviticus 6:11 is necessary <b>for</b> the matter of <b>receiving a share,</b> teaching that blemished priests may do so along with the other priests. This is the source for the mishna’s statement.",
    "It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sin offering: <b>“Every male</b> among the priests may eat thereof” (Leviticus 6:22). The phrase “every male” serves <b>to include blemished</b> priests. The Gemara explains: <b>For what</b> matter is this derivation necessary? <b>If</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>consumption, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated</b> in Leviticus, chapter 21? <b>If</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>receiving a share, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated</b> in verse 6:11? Rather, the verse is necessary <b>because</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a priest who was at first <b>unblemished and</b> later <b>became blemished. From where</b> is it derived that one <b>blemished from birth</b> also receives a share? <b>The verse states</b> here: <b>“Every male.”</b>",
    "It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the guilt offering: <b>“Every male</b> among the priests may eat thereof” (Leviticus 7:6). The phrase “every male” serves <b>to include a blemished</b> priest. The Gemara explains: <b>For what</b> matter is this derivation necessary? <b>If</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>eating, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated? And if</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> the matter of <b>receiving a share, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated? And if</b> one suggests it is <b>for</b> a priest <b>blemished from birth, isn’t</b> that <b>already stated?</b> Rather, the verse is necessary <b>because</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a permanently blemished</b> priest. <b>From where</b> is it derived that a <b>temporarily blemished</b> priest also receives a share? <b>The verse states</b> here: <b>“Every male.”</b>",
    "The Gemara objects: <b>Isn’t it the opposite [<i>kelapei layya</i>]?</b> Wouldn’t I have thought that a priest with a permanent blemish would be treated more stringently than one with a temporary blemish? <b>Rav Sheshet said: Reverse</b> the wording as follows: One might have thought that I have derived only the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a priest with a temporary blemish; from where is it derived that one with a permanent blemish also receives a share?",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said: Actually, do not reverse</b> the wording, <b>and</b> this is not difficult. It <b>was necessary</b> to teach that even a priest with a temporary blemish receives a share, because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b>"
