    "<b>One day</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>heard</b> Rav Ashi <b>studying</b> and reciting the following statement. <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>one who removes a fish from the sea</b> on Shabbat, <b>when</b> an area <b>on</b> the skin of the fish <b>the size of a <i>sela</i></b> coin <b>has dried up,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for violating the prohibition against slaughtering an animal on Shabbat. A fish in that condition cannot survive, and therefore one who removed it from the water is liable for killing it. Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>And let the Master say</b> that this is the case provided that the skin that dried is <b>between its fins.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And doesn’t the Master maintain that Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Avin said this</b> ruling? Why didn’t you state it in his name? Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>said to him: I am he.</b>",
    "Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And didn’t the Master</b> sit <b>before</b> and <b>frequent</b> the study hall <b>of Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat?</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And what is the reason</b> that <b>the Master left</b> him <b>and came here?</b> Rabbi Yosei bar Avin <b>said to him:</b> I was concerned and departed because he is so severe and unforgiving. He is <b>a man who has no mercy on his</b> own <b>son, and no mercy on his daughter. How,</b> then, <b>could he have mercy on me?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the incident involving <b>his son? One day</b> Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat <b>hired</b> day <b>laborers to</b> work his <b>field. It grew late and he did not bring them food.</b> The workers <b>said to the son of</b> Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat: <b>We are starving. They were sitting under a fig tree,</b> so the son <b>said: Fig tree, fig tree. Yield your fruits,</b> so that my <b>father’s workers may eat.</b> The fig tree <b>yielded</b> fruit, <b>and they ate.</b>",
    "<b>In the meantime, his father came</b> and <b>said to</b> the workers: <b>Do not be angry with me for being late, as I was engaged in a mitzva, and until just now I was traveling</b> for that purpose and could not get here any sooner. <b>They said to him:</b> May <b>the Merciful One satisfy you just as your son satisfied us</b> and gave us food. <b>He said to them: From where</b> did he find food to give you? <b>They said: Such-and-such an incident occurred.</b> Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat <b>said to</b> his son: <b>My son, you troubled your Creator</b> to cause <b>the fig to yield its fruit not in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> so too, you will die young. And indeed, his son <b>died before his time.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the incident involving <b>his daughter? He had</b> a very <b>beautiful daughter. One day</b> Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat <b>saw a certain man piercing a hole in the hedge</b> surrounding his property <b>and looking at</b> his daughter. Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: What is this?</b> The man <b>said to him: My teacher, if I have not merited taking her</b> in marriage, shall <b>I not</b> at least <b>merit to look at her? Rabbi Yosei said to her: My daughter, you are causing people distress. Return to your dust, and let people no</b> longer <b>stumble</b> into sin <b>due to you.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara relates another story involving Rabbi Yosei from Yokrat. <b>He had a certain donkey that people hired each day</b> for work. <b>In the evening they would send it back</b> with <b>the money for its hire on its back, and</b> the animal would <b>go to its owner’s house. But if they added or subtracted from</b> the appropriate sum, the donkey <b>would not go. One day</b> someone <b>forgot a pair of sandals on</b> the donkey, <b>and it did not move until they removed</b> the sandals <b>from</b> its back, <b>after which it went off.</b>",
    "The Gemara cites more stories about miracles that occurred to righteous individuals. <b>Whenever the charity collectors would see Elazar of</b> the village of <b>Birta, they would hide from him, as any</b> money Elazar <b>had with him he would give them,</b> and they did not want to take all his property. <b>One day,</b> Elazar <b>went to the market to purchase</b> what he needed <b>for his daughter’s dowry. The charity collectors saw him and hid from him.</b>",
    "<b>He went and ran after them, saying to them: I adjure you,</b> tell me, <b>in what</b> mitzva <b>are you engaged? They said to him:</b> We are collecting money for the wedding <b>of an orphan boy and an orphan girl. He said to them:</b> I swear <b>by the Temple service that they take precedence over my daughter. He took everything he had with him and gave it to them. He was left with one</b> single <b>dinar,</b> with which <b>he bought himself wheat, and</b> he then <b>ascended</b> to his house <b>and threw it into the granary.</b>",
    "Elazar’s <b>wife came and said to her daughter: What has your father brought? She said to</b> her mother: <b>Whatever he brought he threw into the granary. She went to open the door of the granary,</b> and <b>saw that the granary was full of wheat,</b> so much so that <b>it was coming out through the doorknob, and the door would not open</b> due <b>to the wheat.</b> The granary had miraculously been completely filled. Elazar’s <b>daughter went to the study hall</b> and <b>said to</b> her father: <b>Come and see what He Who loves You,</b> the Almighty, <b>has performed for you. He said to her:</b> I swear <b>by the Temple service,</b> as far <b>as you</b> are concerned this wheat <b>is consecrated</b> property, <b>and you have</b> a share <b>in it only as one of the poor Jews.</b> He said this because he did not want to benefit from a miracle.",
    "The Gemara returns to the topic of fasting for rain. <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia decreed a fast</b> and <b>prayed for mercy, but rain did not come. He said,</b> lamenting: <b>How great</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the prophet <b>Samuel of Rama,</b> for whom rain fell even when he prayed for it in summer, <b>and</b> myself, <b>Yehuda ben Gamliel. Woe to the generation that is stuck</b> with this leadership; <b>woe to him in whose days this has occurred. He grew upset, and rain came.</b>",
    "The Gemara relates another story involving a <i>Nasi’s</i> decree of a fast for rain. <b>In the house of the <i>Nasi</i> a fast was declared, but they didn’t inform Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> of the fast the day before. <b>In the morning they informed them. Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> What are we to do? <b>We did not accept</b> this fast <b>upon ourselves the evening before,</b> and a fast must be accepted in the afternoon service of the day preceding the fast. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: We are drawn after</b> the community, and therefore, when the <i>Nasi</i> declares a public fast there is no need for an individual to accept it upon himself the day before.",
    "The Gemara further states that on another occasion, <b>a fast was declared in the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, but rain did not come. Oshaya, the youngest</b> member <b>of the group</b> of Sages, <b>taught them</b> a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“Then it shall be, if it shall be committed in error by the congregation, it being hidden from their eyes”</b> (Numbers 15:24). This verse indicates that the leaders are considered the eyes of the congregation.",
    "Oshaya continued: There is <b>a parable</b> that illustrates this, <b>involving a bride who is in her father’s home</b> and has not yet been seen by her bridegroom. <b>As long as her eyes are beautiful, her body need not be examined,</b> as certainly she is beautiful. However, if <b>her eyes are bleary [<i>terutot</i>], her entire body requires examination.</b> So too, if the leaders of the generation are flawed, it is a sign that the entire generation is unworthy. By means of this parable, Oshaya was hinting that rain was withheld from the entire nation due to the evil committed by the household of the <i>Nasi</i>. ",
    "The <b>servants</b> of the <i>Nasi</i> <b>came and placed a scarf around his neck and tormented him</b> as punishment for insulting the house of the <i>Nasi</i>. <b>His townsmen said to them: Let him be, as he also causes us pain</b> with his harsh reproof, but <b>since we see that all his actions are for the sake of Heaven we do not say anything to him and let him be. You too</b> should <b>let him be.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>declared a fast but rain did not come. Ilfa descended</b> to lead the service <b>before him, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Ilfi. He recited: He Who makes the wind blow, and the wind</b> indeed <b>blew.</b> He continued to recite: And <b>Who makes the rain come, and</b> subsequently, <b>the rain came.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: What are your</b> good <b>deeds,</b> in the merit of which your prayers are answered so speedily? <b>He said to him: I live in an impoverished city, in which there is no wine for <i>kiddush</i> or <i>havdala</i>. I go to the effort of bringing</b> the residents <b>wine for <i>kiddush</i> and <i>havdala</i>, and I</b> thereby enable them to <b>fulfill their duty.</b> In reward for this mitzva, my prayers for rain were answered.",
    "The Gemara relates a similar incident. <b>Rav happened</b> to come to <b>a certain place</b> where <b>he decreed a fast but rain did not come. The prayer leader descended</b> to lead the service <b>before him</b> and <b>recited: He Who makes the wind blow, and the wind blew.</b> He continued and <b>said:</b> And <b>Who makes the rain fall, and the rain came.</b> Rav <b>said to him: What are your</b> good <b>deeds? He said to him: I am a teacher of children, and I teach the Bible to the children of the poor as to the children of the rich, and</b> if there is <b>anyone who cannot</b> pay, <b>I do not take anything from him. And I have a fishpond, and any</b> child <b>who neglects</b> his studies, <b>I bribe him with</b> the fish <b>and calm him, and soothe him until he comes and reads.</b>",
    "The Gemara further relates: <b>Rav Naḥman decreed a fast, prayed for mercy, but rain did not come.</b> In his misery, he <b>said: Take Naḥman</b> and <b>throw him from the wall to the ground,</b> as the fast he decreed has evidently had no effect. <b>He grew upset, and rain came.</b>",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba decreed a fast. He prayed for mercy, but rain did not come. They said to him: But when</b> this <b>Rav Yehuda decreed a fast, rain would come. He said to them: What can I do? If</b> the difference between us is <b>due to</b> Torah <b>study, we are superior to</b> the previous generation, <b>as in the years of Rav Yehuda all of their learning</b>"
