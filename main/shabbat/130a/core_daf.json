    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> As a continuation to the discussion at the end of the previous chapter, which mentioned circumcision in the context of a discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of childbirth on Shabbat, the mishna continues to address the <i>halakhot</i> of circumcision. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: If he did not bring an implement</b> for circumcising the child <b>on Shabbat eve, he brings it on Shabbat</b> itself <b>uncovered</b> so that it will be clear to all that he is bringing a circumcision scalpel. <b>And in</b> times of <b>danger,</b> when decrees of persecution prohibit Jews from circumcising their children, <b>one covers it in the presence of witnesses</b> who can testify that he transported the scalpel to perform a mitzva.",
    "<b>And furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer said</b> with regard to this issue: <b>One</b> may even <b>cut down trees to prepare charcoal</b> in order <b>to fashion iron tools</b> for the purpose of circumcision.",
    "Rabbi Eliezer’s approach was not universally accepted, and <b>a principle was stated by Rabbi Akiva: Any prohibited labor that can be performed on Shabbat eve does not override Shabbat,</b> including transporting the circumcision scalpel. However, any prohibited labor involved in the mitzva of <b>circumcision</b> itself <b>that cannot be performed on Shabbat eve overrides Shabbat.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is <b>the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion that the scalpel must be uncovered <b>due to affection for the mitzva</b> and the desire to publicize it, <b>or perhaps</b> it is <b>due to</b> avoiding <b>suspicion?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> practical <b>difference is there</b> between the two reasons suggested for Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion? The Gemara answers: The difference is with regard to the question of whether or not it is permitted <b>to bring</b> the scalpel <b>covered in the presence of witnesses</b> who are aware that one is bringing the scalpel for the purpose of circumcision. <b>If you say</b> the reason is <b>due to affection for the mitzva,</b> then if it is <b>uncovered, yes,</b> there is a display of affection for the mitzva. If it is <b>covered, no,</b> there is no display of affection. <b>However, if you say</b> the reason for this ruling is <b>due to</b> avoiding <b>suspicion, even</b> if it is <b>covered</b> he may <b>well</b> do so, because the witnesses are aware that a circumcision will be performed. <b>What</b> is the resolution of this dilemma?",
    "<b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Levi said: Rabbi Eliezer only stated</b> this ruling <b>to</b> express <b>affection for the mitzva. That</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a child is to be circumcised on Shabbat and they failed to bring the scalpel on Shabbat eve, <b>one brings it</b> on Shabbat <b>uncovered,</b> but <b>he does not bring it covered;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rav Ashi said:</b> The language of <b>the mishna is also precise</b> in support of this opinion, <b>as it teaches: And in a time of danger he covers it in the presence of witnesses.</b> By inference, <b>in</b> a time of <b>danger, yes,</b> he covers it; when it is <b>not</b> a time of <b>danger, no,</b> he does not cover it. <b>Conclude from this</b> that the scalpel is uncovered <b>due to affection for the mitzva.</b> The Gemara states: Indeed, <b>conclude from this.</b>",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He brings</b> the scalpel <b>uncovered, and he does not bring it covered;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer: In a time of danger they would customarily bring</b> the scalpel <b>covered in the presence of witnesses.</b>",
    "With regard to these witnesses, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>The</b> necessary <b>witnesses that he is saying,</b> do they include <b>he</b> who is bringing the scalpel <b>and one</b> other witness? <b>Or perhaps</b> they include <b>he</b> who brought the scalpel <b>and two</b> other witnesses to testify on his behalf.",
    "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the language of the mishna, which stated: <b>And in</b> times of <b>danger he covers it in the presence of witnesses. Granted, if you say</b> it is referring to <b>him and two</b> other witnesses, <b>it</b> works out <b>well;</b> the wording is appropriate. <b>However, if you say</b> it is referring to <b>him and one</b> other witness, <b>what</b> is to be made of the use of the term <b>witnesses</b> in the plural when there is only one other witness? The Gemara refutes this proof: They may still be called witnesses, in the plural, because <b>they,</b> i.e., he and the other witness, <b>are fit to testify elsewhere.</b>",
    "We learned in our mishna: <b>And furthermore, Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> One may even cut down trees to prepare charcoal for the purpose of circumcision on Shabbat. With regard to this issue, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the locale of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> where they would follow his ruling, <b>they would</b> even <b>cut down trees</b> on Shabbat <b>to prepare charcoal</b> from it in order <b>to fashion iron</b> tools with which to circumcise a child <b>on Shabbat.</b> On a related note, the <i>baraita</i> relates: <b>In the locale of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili they would eat poultry meat in milk,</b> as Rabbi Yosei HaGelili held that the prohibition of meat in milk does not include poultry.",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>Levi happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Yosef the hunter. They served him the head of a peacock [<i>tavsa</i>] in milk</b> and <b>he did not eat. When</b> Levi <b>came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the latter <b>said to him: Why did you not excommunicate</b> these people who eat poultry in milk, contrary to the decree of the Sages? Levi <b>said to him: It was</b> in <b>the locale</b> of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, and I said: Perhaps he taught them</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> who permits the eating of poultry meat in milk. Given the possibility that their rabbi rules that it is permitted, I cannot come and prohibit it, and I certainly cannot excommunicate them for it.",
    "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna, <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“You shall not eat anything that dies of itself;</b> to the stranger at your gates you may give it, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a holy people to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and it is stated</b> later in the same verse: <b>“You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk.”</b> From the juxtaposition of the two issues it is derived: <b>That which is prohibited due to</b> the prohibition against eating an <b>unslaughtered animal, it is prohibited to cook</b> it <b>in milk.</b> The prohibition against cooking a creature in milk is not limited to only a kid. If so, with regard to <b>poultry, which is prohibited due to</b> the prohibition against eating an <b>unslaughtered animal,</b> I <b>might</b> have thought <b>it should be prohibited to cook</b> it <b>in milk; therefore, the verse states: “In its mother’s milk.”</b> This <b>excludes poultry, which does not have mother’s milk</b> and is therefore not included in the prohibition.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: There was one city in Eretz Yisrael where they would act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> with regard to circumcision, <b>and they would die at their appointed time</b> and not earlier, as a reward for their affection for this mitzva. <b>And not only that, but on one occasion the wicked empire,</b> Rome, <b>issued a decree against the Jewish people</b> prohibiting <b>circumcision; but against that city it did not</b> issue the <b>decree.</b>",
    "Apropos affection for the mitzva of circumcision, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>it was taught</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Every mitzva that</b> the Jews initially <b>accepted upon themselves with joy, such as circumcision, as it is written: “I rejoice at Your word as one who finds great spoil”</b> (Psalms 119:162), and as the Sages explained, this “word” refers to the mitzva of circumcision, over which they rejoiced, <b>they still perform</b> it <b>with joy. And every mitzva that</b> the Jews initially <b>accepted upon themselves with contentiousness</b> and regret, <b>such as</b> the prohibition against <b>incestuous relations, as it is written: “And Moses heard the people weeping, family by family”</b> (Numbers 11:10), and as the Sages interpreted homiletically: They wept <b>over matters</b> pertaining to <b>their families,</b> as they were prohibited at that time from marrying family members, <b>they still perform with contentiousness.</b> The fact is <b>that there is no marriage contract</b> and wedding <b>in which contentiousness does not arise,</b> as there is inevitably some conflict between the parties. The <i>baraita</i> asserts that this is because, initially, the Jews did not accept the laws governing marriage and family relationships willingly.",
    "<b>It was taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> in praise of the observance of the mitzva of circumcision: <b>Any mitzva for which the Jews sacrificed their lives at the time of the decrees of the</b> wicked <b>empire, such as</b> the prohibition of <b>idolatry and</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, is still steadfastly observed. And any mitzva for which the Jews did not sacrifice their lives at the time of the decrees of the</b> wicked <b>empire, such as phylacteries, is still casually observed,</b> meaning that they are not as careful in its fulfillment as they should be.",
    "The Gemara cites proof that the mitzva of phylacteries was not fulfilled properly at the time of the decrees, based upon an incident related to the following <i>halakha</i>. <b>As Rabbi Yannai said:</b> Donning <b>phylacteries requires a clean body like</b> that of <b>Elisha, Man of Wings. What is</b> included in the requirement to have a clean body? <b>Abaye said: That one may not pass wind in them. Rava said: That one may not sleep in them.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And why did they call him Elisha, Man of Wings? Because on one occasion the wicked empire</b> of Rome <b>issued a decree against the Jewish people that,</b> as punishment, <b>they would pierce the brain of anyone who dons phylacteries on his head.</b> Nevertheless, <b>Elisha would don them and</b> defiantly <b>go out to the marketplace.</b> One day, <b>an official</b> who was appointed to enforce the decree <b>saw him.</b> Elisha <b>ran</b> away <b>from him, and</b> the official <b>ran after him. When</b> the official <b>reached him,</b> Elisha <b>removed</b> the phylacteries <b>from his head and held them in his hand.</b> The officer <b>asked him: What is in your hand?</b> Elisha <b>said to him:</b> It is merely <b>a dove’s wings.</b> A miracle took place: <b>He opened his hand, and,</b> indeed, it <b>was found</b> to be <b>a dove’s wings. Therefore,</b> in commemoration of this miracle, <b>they</b> would <b>call him</b> Elisha, <b>Man of Wings.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>a dove’s wings,</b> that Elisha specifically <b>told him</b> that he was holding the wings of a dove <b>and he did not tell him</b> he was holding the wings of <b>other birds?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Because the congregation of Israel is likened to a dove, as it is stated:</b> “You shall shine as <b>the wings of a dove covered with silver and her pinions with yellow gold”</b> (Psalms 68:14). <b>Just as a dove</b> has only <b>its wings to protect it, so too, the Jewish people have</b> only <b>mitzvot to protect them.</b> Apparently, Elisha Man of Wings was vigilant in fulfilling the mitzva of phylacteries in the face of the decree, whereas the rest of the people were not.",
    "<b>Rabbi Abba bar Rav Adda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> as follows: <b>On one occasion</b> they were supposed to circumcise a baby on Shabbat, and <b>they forgot and did not bring a scalpel</b> with which to circumcise him <b>on Shabbat eve, and they brought it on Shabbat via roofs and via courtyards,</b>"
