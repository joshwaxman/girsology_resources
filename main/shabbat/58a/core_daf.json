    "the rabbinic decree prohibiting adorning brides with <b>bridal crowns</b> to commemorate the destruction of the Temple does <b>not</b> apply <b>to</b> an <i>istema</i>.",
    "Earlier, the Gemara cited Rabbi Abbahu’s opinion that the <i>kavul</i> mentioned in the mishna, which one may not wear into the public domain on Shabbat, is a woolen cap. <b>And Shmuel said: It is the seal of a slave</b> that <b>we learned</b> about in the mishna. The Gemara asks: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? Didn’t Shmuel say: A slave may go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with a seal that is around his neck but not with a seal that is on his clothes?</b> Apparently, Shmuel holds that one may go out into the public domain with a slave’s seal. How, then, could he say that <i>kavul</i> in the mishna, with which one may not go out into the public domain, is referring to the seal of a slave?",
    "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> where Shmuel said that one may go out with a slave’s seal on Shabbat, <b>is</b> referring to a case <b>where his master made it for him.</b> The slave will not remove it because he fears his master. Therefore, there is no concern lest he carry it. However, <b>that,</b> where the mishna said that it is prohibited to go out with a <i>kavul</i>, which according to Shmuel is the seal of a slave, is referring to a case <b>where he made it for himself</b> to indicate to all who his master is so that he may enjoy his master’s protection. In that case, since it is dependent solely upon his discretion, there is concern lest he remove the seal and carry it. Therefore, the Sages prohibited going out with it into the public domain.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> case <b>did you establish this</b> statement <b>of Shmuel?</b> It is in the case of a seal <b>that his master made for him.</b> If so, <b>why</b> may he <b>not</b> go out <b>with a seal on his clothes?</b> There too, since his master made it for him he will not remove it.",
    "The Gemara answers: There the concern is that <b>perhaps</b> the seal <b>will be severed, and</b> the slave <b>will fear</b> his master <b>and fold</b> his cloak <b>and place it on his shoulders</b> so that his master will not see that he has no seal on his clothing. That concern is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef; as Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who goes out</b> into the public domain <b>with a cloak folded and resting on his shoulders on Shabbat is liable to bring a sin-offering.</b> That is not the manner in which one wears a garment; it is the manner in which one carries a burden.",
    "<b>And</b> this is <b>like that which Shmuel said to Rav Ḥinnana bar Sheila: All of the Sages</b> affiliated with <b>the house of the Exilarch may not go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with sealed cloaks [<i>sarbal</i>],</b> i.e., garments with seals on them, <b>except for you, since</b> the people <b>of the Exilarch’s house are not particular with</b> regard to <b>you.</b> The Sages affiliated with the Exilarch were officially considered servants of the house and would wear the seal of the house of the Exilarch. Therefore, it was prohibited for them to go out into the public domain on Shabbat with a cloak bearing the Exilarch’s seal, lest the seal break and, in fear of the Exilarch, they remove the cloak, fold it, place it on their shoulders, and carry it on Shabbat. Only Rav Ḥinnana bar Sheila was permitted to go out with this seal on Shabbat since the people of the Exilarch’s house were not exacting with him. Even if he wore clothing with no seal, they would not consider it an act of insubordination against the Exilarch.",
    "The Gemara discusses <b>the matter itself: Shmuel said</b> that <b>a slave may go out with a seal that is around his neck but not with a seal that is on his clothes.</b> That opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A slave may go out with a seal that is around his neck but not with a seal that is on his clothes.</b>",
    "The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>The slave may neither go out with a seal that is around his neck nor with a seal that is on his clothes</b> on Shabbat, and both <b>this and that cannot become ritually impure. And</b> he may <b>not</b> go out <b>with a bell that is</b> hung <b>around his neck; however, he may go out with a bell that is on his clothes,</b> and both <b>this and that can become ritually impure.</b>",
    "<b>And an animal may neither go out with a seal that is around its neck, nor with a seal that is on its clothes, nor with a bell that is on its clothes, nor with a bell that is around its neck</b> since with regard to an animal these are considered burdens not ornaments. Both <b>this,</b> the seal, <b>and that,</b> the bell, <b>cannot become ritually impure</b> because animal ornaments and utensils do not fall into the category of objects that can become ritually impure. Apparently, it is even prohibited for a slave to go out with a seal around his neck, contrary to Shmuel’s opinion.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which permits going out, is referring to a case <b>where his master made him</b> the seal. Since he fears removing it, there is no concern that he will come to carry it. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits going out, is referring to a case <b>where he made it for himself</b> and there is concern lest he come to remove it and carry it.",
    "The Gemara rejects this resolution: <b>No,</b> both <b>this and that are</b> referring to a case <b>where his master made</b> it <b>for him.</b> The difference can be explained differently. <b>And here,</b> where it was prohibited, it is referring <b>to</b> a seal <b>of metal, and here,</b> where it was permitted, it is a seal <b>of clay. And as Rav Naḥman</b> said that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: With an object about which his master is particular, one may not go out</b> on Shabbat, lest it become detached from the garment, and fear of his master lead the slave to carry it in his hand. <b>With an object about which his master is not particular, one may go out with it.</b>",
    "The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the <i>baraita</i> <b>from the fact that it teaches</b> there: <b>This</b> seal <b>and that</b> seal <b>cannot become ritually impure. Granted, if you say</b> it is referring to a <b>metal</b> seal, it is possible to understand the novel aspect of the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>These are the</b> objects <b>that cannot become ritually impure; however, their vessels</b> made of the same material <b>can become ritually impure.</b>",
    "<b>However, if you say</b> that <b>we learned</b> with regard to seals <b>of clay,</b> can it be similarly inferred that <b>these</b> seals <b>are the</b> objects that <b>cannot become ritually impure; however, their vessels</b> made of the same material <b>can become ritually impure?</b>",
    "<b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Vessels of stone, vessels of dung, and vessels of earth</b> that are not made into earthenware <b>can neither become ritually impure by Torah law nor by rabbinic law?</b> Apparently, even an actual vessel made of clay cannot become ritually impure. <b>Rather, learn from it</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is referring to utensils made <b>of metal.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it.</b>",
    "In that same <i>baraita</i> <b>the Master said</b> that the slave may <b>not</b> go out <b>with a bell that is around his neck, but he may go out with a bell that is on his clothes.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: With <b>a bell that is around his neck, why</b> may he <b>not</b> go out? It is due to concern <b>lest it be severed and he come to carry it.</b> If so, with <b>a bell on his clothes too, let us be concerned lest it be severed and he come to carry it.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where</b> the bell <b>is woven into</b> the garment, <b>and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, as Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> A<b>nything that is woven</b> into a garment, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree</b> prohibiting going out with it on Shabbat.",
    "In the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier, it was taught that <b>the Master said: An animal may neither go out with a seal that is around its neck, nor with a seal that is on its clothes, nor with a bell that is on its clothes, nor with a bell that is around its neck.</b> Both <b>this and that cannot become ritually impure.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And does a bell of an animal not become ritually impure?</b> The Gemara proceeds to <b>raise a contradiction</b> from that which was taught in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>The bell of an animal</b> can become <b>ritually impure,</b>"
