    "<b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says</b> with regard to an amulet: <b>As long as he does not hold it in his hand and carry it four cubits in the public domain?</b> Apparently, even with regard to an amulet, there is a distinction between wearing it and carrying it.",
    "<b>Rather, with what are we dealing here? With</b> an amulet that is <b>covered in leather.</b> Since the writing itself is covered, the name of God is not degraded when the amulet is brought into the bathroom with him.",
    "The Gemara objects. There is writing on the scrolls of <b>phylacteries, which is covered in</b> the <b>leather</b> of boxes housing the scrolls, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who enters a bathroom</b> while wearing phylacteries <b>must remove</b> the <b>phylacteries at a distance of four cubits and</b> only then <b>enter.</b> There is no halakhic difference whether or not the writing is covered.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>There,</b> with regard to phylacteries, the prohibition to enter the bathroom is not due to the sacred writing on the scrolls inside the phylacteries. Rather, it is <b>due to the</b> letter <b><i>shin</i></b> that protrudes from the leather of the boxes housing the scroll in the phylacteries of the head, <b>as Abaye said:</b> The source of the requirement of the <b><i>shin</i> of the phylacteries is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai.</b> It is required by Torah law. <b>And, Abaye said:</b> The knot in the shape of the letter <b><i>dalet</i></b> in the straps <b>of the phylacteries</b> of the head <b>is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. And, Abaye said:</b> The <b>letter <i>yod</i> of the phylacteries is a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai.</b> It is due to those letters that one must safeguard the sanctity of the phylacteries and refrain from taking them into the bathroom.",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>And</b> he may <b>neither</b> go out <b>with <i>shiryon</i>, nor with a <i>kasda</i>, nor with <i>maggafayim</i>.</b> These terms were not understood, and therefore the Gemara explains them:",
    "<b><i>Shiryon</i></b> is <b>a coat of mail [<i>zerada</i>],</b> armor made of scales. <b><i>Kasda</i>: Rav said</b> that it is <b>a leather hat [<i>sanvarta</i>]</b> worn under a metal helmet. <b><i>Maggafayim</i>: Rav said</b> they are <b>leg armor</b> worn beneath the knee.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A woman may neither go out</b> to the public domain <b>with a perforated needle,</b> i.e., a standard needle with an eye, <b>nor with a ring that has a seal on it, nor with a <i>kulyar</i>, nor with a <i>kovelet</i>,</b> the identity of which will be discussed in the Gemara, <b>nor with a flask of balsam oil.</b>",
    "<b>And if she did go out</b> into the public domain, <b>she is liable to bring a sin-offering;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that in doing so she violated the Torah prohibition of carrying a burden in the public domain on Shabbat. <b>And the Rabbis exempt</b> one who goes out on Shabbat <b>with a <i>kovelet</i> and with a flask of balsam oil.</b> In their opinion, these are ornaments, and therefore they do not fundamentally violate the Torah prohibition of carrying in the public domain on Shabbat.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to that which we learned in the mishna that a woman may not go out on Shabbat with a ring that has a seal, and by inference that she may go out with a ring without a seal, <b>Ulla said: And the reverse</b> of <b>these</b> <i>halakhot</i> is true <b>with regard to a man.</b> A man who wears a ring with a seal in the public domain is exempt. However, if he wears a ring without a seal, he is liable to bring a sin-offering as it is not considered an ornament for a man. Based on that statement, the Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently, Ulla holds</b> that <b>every object that is suitable for a man is not suitable for a woman, and an object that is suitable for a woman is not suitable for a man.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Shepherds may go out</b> on Shabbat <b>in</b> garments made of <b>sacks. And not</b> with regard to <b>the shepherds alone did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that they are permitted to go out in sacks on Shabbat; <b>rather, any person</b> may do so. <b>However,</b> the Sages taught the <i>halakha</i> with regard to shepherds because <b>it is the</b> standard <b>practice of shepherds to go out in sacks.</b> Apparently, although a sack is not a typical garment for most people, it is permitted even for one who is not a shepherd and would not generally wear it. Based on the same principle, although men do not generally wear women’s ornaments and women do not generally wear men’s ornaments, since occasionally a man might wear an ornament belonging to a woman or vice versa, each should be permitted to go out into the public domain with the ornament of the other.",
    "<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said: Ulla holds</b> that <b>women are a people unto themselves.</b> The difference between the standard practice of men and women is greater than the difference between the standard practice of practitioners of different professions.",
    "<b>Abaye raised an objection</b> to Rav Yosef’s statement from the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who finds phylacteries</b> outside of the city on Shabbat <b>should</b> don them and <b>bring them into</b> the city <b>one pair at a time.</b> This applies to <b>both a man and a woman. And if you say</b> that <b>women are a people unto themselves, isn’t</b> the mitzva to don phylacteries <b>a time-bound, positive mitzva,</b> as there are times when the mitzva to don phylacteries is not in effect? <b>And</b> the following is a halakhic principle: <b>Women are exempt from every time-bound, positive mitzva.</b> If, in fact, the clothing and ornaments of a man are not suitable for a woman under any circumstances, why is a woman permitted to don the phylacteries and bring them into the city on Shabbat? Shouldn’t that be considered a prohibited act of carrying?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to phylacteries, <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>night is an</b> appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries, and Shabbat</b> and Festivals are similarly <b>an</b> appropriate <b>time</b> to don <b>phylacteries.</b> Consequently, the mitzva of phylacteries is <b>a positive mitzva</b> that is <b>not time bound; and</b> in <b>every positive mitzva</b> that is <b>not time bound, women are obligated.</b> Therefore, women are permitted to don the phylacteries and bring them into the city.",
    "With regard to Rabbi Meir’s ruling in the mishna that a woman is liable by Torah law if she goes out into the public domain wearing a ring with a seal, the Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it</b> considered <b>carrying out in a backhanded manner?</b> A ring with a seal is not an ornament for a woman; it is an object like any other. One typically carries objects holding them in his hand. Wearing an object around one’s finger is atypical. There is no Torah prohibition violated when a labor is performed in an atypical manner.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that <b>we are dealing</b> in the mishna <b>with a woman who is a treasurer</b> for charity. A woman with that occupation typically wears a ring with a seal on her finger in order to perform her job. She does not, though, wear it as an ornament. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You answered</b> and explained why, in the case of a <b>woman,</b> she would be liable to bring a sin-offering. However, in the case of a <b>man</b> who wore a ring without a seal, <b>what is there to say?</b> Why should he be liable?",
    "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that there is a different reason: <b>Sometimes a person gives his wife a ring that has a seal on it to take it to</b> his house and place it in <b>a box</b> for safekeeping, <b>and,</b> in order to ensure that she does not lose the ring, the woman <b>places it in on her hand,</b> i.e., on her finger, <b>until she reaches the box. And,</b> likewise, <b>sometimes a woman gives her husband a ring that does not have a seal on it to take it to a craftsman to repair it, and</b> the husband <b>places it on his hand,</b> i.e., on his finger, <b>until he reaches the craftsman.</b> The purpose of wearing these rings is not for ornamentation. Nevertheless, it is considered a typical manner of carrying them.",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>Nor with a <i>kulyar</i>, nor with a <i>kovelet</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> a <b><i>kulyar</i>? Rav said: A brooch</b> with which a woman fastens the collar of her garment. <b><i>Kovelet</i>: Rav said</b> that it is <b>a bundle of fragrant herbs [<i>pilon</i>]. And, similarly, Rav Asi said: A bundle of fragrant herbs.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman may not go out</b> on Shabbat <b>with a bundle of fragrant herbs, and if she did go out she is liable to bring a sin-offering,</b> as she violated a Torah prohibition; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: She may not go out</b> <i>ab initio</i>; <b>however, if she went out, she is exempt. Rabbi Eliezer says: A woman may go out with a bundle of fragrant herbs</b> even <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>it is a burden.</b> Therefore, one who takes it out into the public domain on Shabbat is liable to bring a sin-offering. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>it is an ornament.</b> Nevertheless, they prohibited going out with it <i>ab initio</i> due to concern <b>lest she remove</b> the bundle of herbs from its place, <b>and show it</b> to others, <b>and come to carry it</b> in the public domain. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer holds: Whose practice is it to place</b> fragrant herbs on herself? <b>A woman whose odor is foul.</b> But <b>a woman whose odor is foul does not remove and show</b> the bundle to others because, by doing so, her odor will be detected, a situation that she would prefer to avoid. <b>And,</b> therefore she <b>will not come to carry it four cubits in the public domain.</b>",
    "This <i>baraita</i> cites the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who permits, even <i>ab initio</i>, going out into the public domain with a bundle of herbs. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer exempts</b> a woman who goes out on Shabbat <b>with a bundle of herbs and with a flask of balsam oil?</b> With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, exempt means that although it is not prohibited by Torah law, it is prohibited <i>ab initio</i> by rabbinic law.",
    "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult.</b> When Rabbi Eliezer made <b>this</b> statement, it was <b>when he was addressing</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Meir.</b> When Rabbi Eliezer made <b>that</b> statement, it was <b>when he was addressing</b> the statement <b>of the Rabbis.</b> To clarify: <b>When he was addressing</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who <b>said</b> that <b>she is liable to bring a sin-offering, he said to him</b> that she is <b>exempt</b> from bringing the sacrifice. <b>When he was addressing</b> the statement of <b>the Rabbis, who said</b> that she is <b>exempt but</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> <i>ab initio</i><b>, he said</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> even <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>"
