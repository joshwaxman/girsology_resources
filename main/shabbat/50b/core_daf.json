    "<b>A nazirite,</b> for whom it is prohibited to cut his hair, <b>may wash</b> his hair with sand and natron <b>and separate</b> it with his fingers; <b>however, he may not comb</b> it, as combing will certainly cause hair to fall out. Apparently, Rabbi Shimon permits washing hair even in a case where it is prohibited to cause hair to fall out; in his opinion, the fact that washing one’s hair might inadvertently cause that to happen is not a source of concern.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which disagree with regard to cleaning silver utensils with sand and natron, are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that an unintentional act is prohibited. <b>And</b> there are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i> in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> They disagree with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion. <b>This <i>tanna</i>, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, holds</b> that sand and natron <b>scrape</b> and smooth the utensils. Therefore, their use on Shabbat is prohibited. <b>And that <i>tanna</i>,</b> also <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, holds</b> that sand and natron <b>do not scrape</b> and smooth the utensils. Therefore, their use on Shabbat is permitted.",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>How did you establish</b> that <i>baraita</i>? It was <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But his face, his hands, and his feet,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to wash with sand and natron. <b>Doesn’t he</b> thereby <b>cause hair to fall out?</b> It should be prohibited according to Rabbi Yehuda.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the permission to wash one’s face with sand and natron refers to <b>a child; and if you wish, say</b> instead that it refers to <b>a woman; and if you wish, say</b> instead that it refers to <b>a eunuch.</b> All of them have no facial hair, and that is why there is no concern that use of sand and natron to clean their faces will cause hair to fall out.",
    "The Gemara continues: <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> Washing one’s face with <b>powdered frankincense</b> (Rav Hai Gaon) <b>is permitted</b> on Shabbat, even if he has a beard, as it does not cause hair to fall out. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> Washing with the <b>solid residue of jasmine</b> from which its fragrant oil was squeezed <b>is permitted. Rava said:</b> Washing with <b>ground pepper is permitted. Rav Sheshet said:</b> Washing with <b><i>berada</i> is permitted</b> on Shabbat.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>berada</i>? Rav Yosef said:</b> It is a mixture of <b>one-third aloe, one-third myrtle,</b> and <b>one-third violets. Rav Neḥemya bar Yosef said: Everywhere that there is</b> a mixture with <b>no majority of aloe,</b> it may <b>well</b> be used. Even if the mixture contains more than a third aloe, as long as it constitutes less than a majority, it does not cause hair to fall out.",
    "The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>splitting olives</b> on a rock <b>on Shabbat</b> in order to wash with the oil that oozes from them (<i>ge’onim</i>)? <b>He said to them: And did they permit</b> doing so <b>on a weekday?</b> Rav Sheshet <b>holds</b> that crushing olives in that manner is prohibited even during the week <b>because</b> it involves <b>ruining food.</b> After the olives are split in that manner, they are no longer fit for consumption.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say</b> that Rav Sheshet <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel said: A person may perform all his needs with bread,</b> and he need not be concerned that it might be ruined. The Sages <b>said</b> in response: Rav Sheshet does not necessarily disagree with Shmuel. Using <b>bread</b> does <b>not</b> render it <b>disgusting</b> and inedible; splitting <b>these</b> olives renders them <b>disgusting</b> and inedible.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Ameimar, Mar Zutra, and Rav Ashi were sitting</b> on Shabbat, <b>and they brought <i>berada</i> before them</b> for washing. <b>Ameimar and Rav Ashi washed</b> with it; <b>Mar Zutra did not wash. They said to him: Doesn’t the Master hold in accordance with that which Rav Sheshet said:</b> Washing with <b><i>berada</i> is permitted</b> on Shabbat? <b>Rav Mordekhai,</b> who was also there, <b>said to them: Except for him, the Master;</b> i.e., do not draw conclusions from Mar Zutra, <b>as he does not hold</b> that one is permitted to use <i>berada</i>, <b>even on a weekday.</b>",
    "Mar Zutra <b>holds in accordance with that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may scrape off</b> dried <b>excrement crusts and scabs of a wound that are on his flesh because of</b> the <b>pain</b> that they are causing <b>him.</b> However, <b>if</b> he does so in order <b>to</b> clean and <b>beautify himself, it is prohibited.</b> According to the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i>, it is prohibited to adorn or beautify oneself, as the verse: “Neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment” (Deuteronomy 22:5) prohibits dressing or conducting oneself in the manner of women.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> Ameimar and Rav Ashi, who permit use of <i>berada</i>, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do they hold?</b> They hold <b>in accordance with that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person must wash his face, his hands, and his feet every day for</b> the sake of <b>his Maker, as it is stated: “The Lord has made everything for His own purpose”</b> (Proverbs 16:4). Every beautiful thing that exists in the world sings the praise of God Who created beautiful things. Therefore, it is appropriate for one to beautify himself in praise of God.",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> If he placed the pot in <b>a basket</b> filled with fleece, <b>he leans</b> the basket <b>on its side</b> so that the fleece will fall to the side of the pot, <b>and takes</b> the pot. Otherwise, there is room for concern <b>lest</b> the wool collapse when <b>he lifts</b> the pot from the basket. Then he will be unable to replace the pot. It is prohibited to move the fleece to make room for the pot, since the fleece is set-aside. However, the Rabbis disagree and say: He may lift the pot and afterward replace it. <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Everyone agrees,</b> even the Rabbis, <b>that if the cavity</b> in which the pot had been placed <b>was destroyed,</b> its walls having collapsed inward, <b>it is prohibited to return</b> the pot to the basket.",
    "The Gemara asks, based on what <b>we learned</b> in the mishna. <b>And the Rabbis say: He may lift</b> the pot <b>and</b> afterward <b>replace it.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>What are the circumstances? If the cavity</b> in which the pot had been placed <b>was not destroyed, the Rabbis say fittingly</b> that it is permitted to replace the pot; why would Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya prohibit the practice? <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the Rabbis permit returning the pot <b>even though the cavity was destroyed?</b> Apparently, that is the subject of the dispute in the mishna.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, actually,</b> everyone agrees that if the cavity was destroyed, it is prohibited to return the pot to the basket. The mishna is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the cavity <b>was not destroyed, and here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether or not <b>one</b> need be <b>concerned</b> lest, if one is allowed to remove the pot from the basket without tilting it to the side, the cavity be destroyed and he will come to return the pot to the basket anyway. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, <b>holds</b> that <b>one</b> need be <b>concerned lest the cavity be destroyed</b> and he return the pot anyway; <b>and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> a reference to the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>one</b> need <b>not</b> be <b>concerned</b> about that.",
    "The Gemara records several rulings with regard to placing an object into another object that is set-aside. <b>Rav Huna said:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> fragrant <b>daffodil branch</b> that was kept in a pot of moist earth in the house; if on Shabbat eve one <b>inserted it</b> into the earth, then <b>pulled it out, and then inserted it</b> again into the earth, <b>it is permitted</b> to pull it out again on Shabbat. By inserting it and then pulling it out, he has already widened the cavity in which the branch was placed. There is no room for concern that when he pulls it out again on Shabbat he will cause earth to shift from its place. <b>And if</b> he did <b>not</b> do so on Shabbat eve, <b>it is prohibited</b> to pull it out on Shabbat.",
    "<b>Shmuel said: This knife that is</b> stored <b>between bricks; if one stuck it</b> between the bricks on Shabbat eve, <b>pulled it out, and then stuck it</b> between the bricks, <b>it is permitted</b> to pull it out on Shabbat. <b>And if</b> he did <b>not</b> do so on Shabbat eve, <b>it is prohibited</b> to pull it out on Shabbat.",
    "<b>Mar Zutra, and some say Rav Ashi, said:</b> Placing a knife <b>between</b> the branches of <b>a hedge of reeds</b> (<i>ge’onim</i>) may <b>well</b> be done and there is no concern lest one come to cut the reeds when he removes it.",
    "<b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rava: Rav Ketina raised a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinions of Rav Huna and Shmuel from that which we learned in a mishna: With regard to <b>one who conceals a turnip or radish</b> in the ground <b>beneath a vine</b> for safekeeping, <b>if some of its leaves were showing,</b> allowing access to pull the turnip or the radish from the ground, <b>he need neither be concerned;</b>"
