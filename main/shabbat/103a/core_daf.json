    "<b>One who drills a hole of any size is liable. Granted,</b> according <b>to Rav,</b> who said that one who makes a hole is liable due to the prohibited labor of building, here too, he should be liable because he <b>appears as one who is making a hole for</b> the purpose of <b>building. However,</b> according <b>to Shmuel,</b> drilling a hole is <b>not a completion of the labor.</b> The labor will be complete only when a stake or pin is inserted into the hole. Until he does so, he cannot be liable for completing the labor. The Gemara answers: <b>With what we are dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where one drilled a hole with an iron nail and left it inside</b> the surface in which he drilled the hole. <b>That is</b> considered <b>a completion of labor</b> because there is no intention to remove the nail from its hole.",
    "We learned in the mishna that <b>this is the principle:</b> Anyone who performs a prohibited labor and his labor endures on Shabbat is liable. The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> the phrase: <b>This is the principle,</b> come <b>to include?</b> The Gemara explains: It comes <b>to include</b> a case <b>where one carved out</b> a vessel with a capacity of <b>half a <i>kav</i> [<i>kefiza</i>]</b> into a piece of wood <b>in</b> which it was possible to chisel a vessel with a capacity of <b>a</b> whole <b><i>kav</i>.</b> Since this labor endures on Shabbat and it can be used, it is considered a complete labor and he is liable.",
    "We also learned in the mishna that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> Even <b>one who strikes an anvil with a sledgehammer</b> is liable. The Gemara wonders: <b>What has he done</b> by striking the anvil that would render him liable? It was <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef who both said</b> in explanation: He is liable <b>because he trains his hand</b> for his work by striking the anvil. <b>The sons of</b> a man named <b>Raḥava</b> found <b>this</b> answer <b>difficult: If so, one who observed a craft</b> being performed <b>on Shabbat and learned</b> to perform that craft through observation, would <b>he also be liable?</b> Only one who performs an actual labor on Shabbat is liable. <b>Rather,</b> it was <b>Abaye and Rava who both said</b> in explanation: He is liable, <b>as those who flatten plates</b> of metal <b>for the Tabernacle do so.</b> They would strike the anvil with the sledgehammer in order to straighten the sledgehammer’s handle, which became crooked. <b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even one who strikes an anvil with a sledgehammer during his labor is liable, as those who flatten plates</b> of metal <b>for the Tabernacle do so.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who plows</b> is liable for plowing <b>any amount</b> of land on Shabbat. <b>One who weeds</b> and removes grass on Shabbat, <b>and one who removes dry branches and who prunes any amount is liable.</b> With regard to <b>one who gathers wood, if</b> he did so <b>to enhance</b> the tree or the land, he is liable for <b>any amount; if</b> he did so <b>for fuel,</b> he is liable for collecting a measure <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to cook an easily</b> cooked <b>egg.</b> With regard to <b>one who gathers grass, if</b> he did so <b>to enhance</b> the plants or the land, he is liable for <b>any amount; if</b> he did so to feed <b>an animal,</b> he is liable for collecting a measure <b>equivalent to a goat’s mouthful.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: For <b>what</b> use <b>is</b> plowing any amount of land <b>suited?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>suited</b> for <b>a</b> single <b>pumpkin seed.</b> The <b>corresponding</b> situation <b>in the Tabernacle</b> was <b>as it is suitable</b> for planting <b>a single stalk of herbs</b> to make dyes.",
    "We also learned in the mishna: <b>One who weeds, and one who removes dry branches, and who prunes</b> any amount is liable. <b>The Sages taught</b> that in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who severs endives</b> that grow like weeds, <b>or who prunes reeds [<i>zeradim</i>]; if</b> he did so <b>for</b> human <b>consumption,</b> he is liable in the measure of <b>a fig-bulk; if</b> he did so <b>for animal</b> consumption, he is liable in a measure <b>equivalent to a goat’s mouthful. If</b> he did so <b>for fuel,</b> he is liable for severing a measure <b>equivalent</b> to that which is used <b>to cook an easily</b> cooked <b>egg. If</b> he did so <b>to enhance the land,</b> he is liable for <b>any amount.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Aren’t all these</b> done <b>to enhance the land?</b> Each stalk that a person uproots enhances the land. It was <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef who both said</b> in explanation: <b>They taught</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to swampland,</b> where grass is not uprooted to enhance the land. <b>Abaye said: Even if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a field that is not a swampland,</b> it can be referring to <b>a case where one did not intend</b> to enhance the land. The Gemara asks: <b>However,</b> is it not <b>Abaye and Rava who both say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one is liable only for performing an intentional action, <b>concedes</b> that one is liable in a case of <b>cut off its head, will it not die?</b> In any case where the outcome is inevitable, as in this case where the land will be enhanced, one’s lack of intention does not exempt him. The Gemara answers: Abaye’s statement <b>was</b> only <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where one did so on another’s land.</b> Since he did not intend for that outcome to eventuate and he derives no benefit from enhancing the land, he is not liable in that case.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who writes two letters</b> on Shabbat, <b>whether</b> he did so <b>with his right</b> hand <b>or his left, whether</b> they were <b>the same letter or two</b> different <b>letters, whether</b> he did so <b>using two</b> different types of <b>ink, in any language, he is liable. Rabbi Yosei said: One is deemed liable</b> for writing <b>two letters only due to marking, as they</b> would <b>write</b> symbols <b>on</b> adjacent <b>beams of the Tabernacle to know which</b> beam was another beam’s <b>counterpart. Rabbi Yehuda said: We found</b> that one is liable for writing even if he did not complete what he was writing, so that he wrote <b>a small name</b> that constituted part <b>of a longer name,</b> e.g., <b>Shem [<i>shin mem</i>] from</b> the name <b>Shimon</b> or <b>from Shmuel; Noaḥ [<i>nun ḥet</i>] from Naḥor; Dan [<i>dalet nun</i>] from Daniel; Gad [<i>gimmel dalet</i>] from Gaddiel.</b> In all of these cases, the first two letters of the longer name constitute the shorter name.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions the beginning of the mishna: <b>Granted, for</b> writing with <b>the right</b> hand <b>let one be liable, as that is the</b> typical <b>manner of writing. However, for</b> writing with <b>the left</b> hand, <b>why</b> is one liable? <b>That is not the</b> typical <b>manner of writing. Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> When the mishna taught that one who writes with his left hand is liable, <b>they taught</b> it <b>with regard to</b> one who is <b>left-handed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if so, <b>let his left</b> hand have the same legal status <b>as everyone’s right</b> hand; for writing <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> hand, <b>let him be liable,</b> for writing <b>with</b> his <b>right</b> hand, <b>let him not be liable. Rather, Abaye said:</b> This mishna refers to an <b>ambidextrous</b> person, who is liable for writing with either hand.",
    "<b>Rav Ya’akov, son of the daughter of Ya’akov, said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said: One is deemed liable</b> for writing <b>two letters only due to marking.</b> As such, one is liable for writing a letter even if he writes it imprecisely with his left hand. The Gemara asks: <b>From the fact that the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The Gemara answers: That is not necessarily the case. <b>The entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and the attribution of his second statement was for emphasis alone.",
    "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: We found</b> that one is liable for writing even if he did not complete what he was writing, so that he wrote a small name that constituted part of a longer name. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather,</b> is that to say that according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it is one who writes <b>two letters that are two different types</b> of letters <b>who is liable;</b> however, one who writes <b>two letters that are one type</b> of letter <b>is not liable?</b>",
    "<b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “When a leader sinned, <b>and he</b> unwittingly <b>performed one</b> of any of the commandments which the Lord his God commanded not to do, and is guilty” (Leviticus 4:22)? The Sages taught: I <b>might</b> have thought that one is not guilty until he performs a complete labor, e.g., <b>until he writes the entire name</b> that he intended to write, <b>or until he weaves the entire garment, or until he crafts the entire sieve</b> made from the reeds of the warp and the woof; therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “A soul who sins unintentionally in any of the Lord’s commandments which one shall not perform, and did an action <b>from one</b> of these” (Leviticus 4:2).",
    "The emphasis on the phrase “from one” teaches that in order for one to be liable, it is sufficient that he perform only part of the prohibited labor. However, <b>if</b> that is derived from the use of the phrase <b>“from one,”</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that one is liable <b>even if he wrote only a single letter, or</b> even if <b>he wove only a single thread, or</b> even if <b>he crafted only a single eye of the sieve,</b> i.e., arranging the reeds to create a warp, and then interweaving a single reed as a woof;"
