    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, why did You penalize Adam, the first man, with</b> the <b>death</b> penalty? <b>He said to them: I gave him a simple mitzva, and he violated it. They said to Him: Didn’t Moses and Aaron, who observed the whole Torah in its entirety,</b> nevertheless <b>die?</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>said to them,</b> citing the verse: “All things come alike to all; <b>there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good</b> and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices, and to him who does not sacrifice; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he who swears, as he who fears an oath” (Ecclesiastes 9:2). Apparently, death is not dependent upon one’s actions. Everyone dies.",
    "The Gemara answers: Rav Ami <b>stated</b> his position <b>in accordance with this <i>tanna</i>, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Even Moses and Aaron died due to their sin, as it is stated:</b> “And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron: <b>Because you did not believe in Me</b>, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation in to the land which I have given them” (Numbers 20:12). <b>Had you believed in Me</b> and spoken to the rock as commanded, <b>your time would not</b> yet <b>have come to leave the world.</b> Apparently, even Moses and Aaron died due to their sins.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from what was taught in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Four</b> people <b>died due to</b> Adam’s sin with <b>the serpent,</b> in the wake of which death was decreed upon all of mankind, although they themselves were free of sin. <b>And they are: Benjamin, son of Jacob; Amram, father of Moses; Yishai, father of David; and Kilab, son of David. And all of them</b> were learned through <b>tradition, except for Yishai, father of David, with regard to whom there is an explicit verse</b> interpreted homiletically, <b>as it is written: “And Absalom placed Amasa in charge of the army in place of Joab, and Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Israelite, who had taken to himself Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeruiah, the mother of Joab”</b> (II Samuel 17:25).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And was</b> Abigail <b>the daughter of Nahash? Wasn’t she the daughter of Yishai, as it is written:</b> “And Yishai begot his firstborn Eliab, and Abinadab the second, and Shimea the third, Nethanel the fourth, Raddai the fifth, Ozem the sixth, David the seventh: <b>and their sisters were Zeruiah and Abigail.</b> And the sons of Zeruiah: Abishai, and Joab, and Asahel, three. And Abigail bore Amasa; and the father of Amasa was Jether the Ishmaelite” (I Chronicles 2:13–17)? Apparently, Abigail was the daughter of Yishai. <b>Rather,</b> the verse states that Abigail was the daughter of Nahash in order to teach us that she was <b>the daughter of one who died on account of</b> Adam’s sin with <b>the serpent [<i>naḥash</i>],</b> though he himself was free of sin.",
    "The Gemara now clarifies the matter: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> that states that four people did not die due to their own sins? <b>If you say</b> that it is the <b><i>tanna</i></b> who taught the conversation between <b>the ministering angels</b> and God, it is difficult, <b>as weren’t there</b> also <b>Moses and Aaron</b> who did not die due to their own sins? <b>Rather, it must be Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who holds that even Moses and Aaron died because of their own sins. <b>Learn from it</b> then that, in principle, he agrees that <b>there is death without sin and there is suffering without iniquity, and</b> this is a <b>conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Ami.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, it is a <b>conclusive refutation.</b>",
    "Having mentioned the sins of some of the significant ancestors of the Jewish people, the Gemara now addresses several additional ancestors. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who says that Reuben sinned</b> with Bilhah <b>is nothing other than mistaken, as it is stated:</b> “And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine; and Israel heard of it. <b>Now the sons of Jacob were twelve”</b> (Genesis 35:22). The fact that the Torah stated the number of Jacob’s sons at that point in the narrative <b>teaches that,</b> even after the incident involving Bilhah, <b>all</b> of the brothers <b>were equal</b> in righteousness. Apparently, Reuben did not sin. <b>How</b> then <b>do I establish</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And he lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine”?</b> The plain understanding of the verse indicates sin. <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches that</b> Reuben <b>rearranged his father’s bed</b> in protest of Jacob’s placement of his bed in the tent of Bilhah and not in the tent of his mother Leah after the death of Rachel. <b>And the verse ascribes to him</b> liability for his action <b>as if he had</b> actually <b>lain with</b> Bilhah.",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: This righteous person,</b> Reuben, <b>was saved from that sin</b> of adultery, <b>and that action did not come to</b> be performed by <b>him? Is it possible</b> that <b>his descendants are destined to stand on Mount Eival and say: “Cursed be he that lies with his father’s wife;</b> because he uncovers his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say, amen” (Deuteronomy 27:20), <b>and this sin will come to</b> be performed by <b>him?</b> Is it conceivable that the members of a tribe would curse their ancestor? <b>How</b> then <b>do I establish</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And he lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine”?</b> It is understood as follows: <b>He protested the affront to his mother. He said: If my mother’s sister</b> Rachel <b>was a rival to my mother, will my mother’s sister’s concubine be a rival to my mother? He</b> immediately <b>stood and rearranged her bed</b> so that Jacob would enter Leah’s tent.",
    "<b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: He rearranged two beds, one of the Divine Presence and one of his father. And that is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written:</b> “Unstable as water, you shall not excel; because you went up to your father’s bed; <b>then you did defile it; he went up to my bed [<i>yetzu</i>’<i>i</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:4). <b>Do not read it as <i>yetzu’i</i>,</b> in the singular; <b>rather, read it as <i>yetzu</i>’<i>ai</i>, my beds,</b> in the plural, referring to both the bed of his father and to the bed of the Divine Presence, which rests in the tents of the righteous.",
    "The Gemara notes that the matter of Reuben’s innocence is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Unstable [<i>paḥaz</i>] as water, you shall not excel.”</b> The Sages understood <i>paḥaz</i> as an acronym. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that it means: <b>You were impulsive [<i>pazta</i>], you were liable [<i>ḥavta</i>], and you acted contemptuously [<i>zalta</i>]. Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that it means: <b>You trampled the law [<i>pasata al dat</i>], you sinned [<i>ḥatata</i>],</b> and <b>you were promiscuous [<i>zanita</i>]. Rabban Gamliel says:</b> The acronym does not refer to Reuben’s sin. It refers to his repentance: <b>You prayed [<i>pilalta</i>], you trembled</b> in fear <b>[<i>ḥalta</i>],</b> and <b>your prayer shone forth [<i>zarḥa</i>].</b>",
    "<b>Rabban Gamliel said: We still need</b> the explanation of <b>the Modaite,</b> as <b>Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i said: Reverse</b> the order of the letters in <b>the word</b> <i>paḥaz</i> <b>and</b> then <b>interpret it homiletically: You shook [<i>zizata</i>], you recoiled</b> [<b><i>hirtata</i>];</b> the <i>ḥet</i> in <i>paḥaz</i> is interchanged with the letter <i>heh</i>, so that you would not sin, and <b>the sin flew [<i>parḥa</i>] from you.</b> Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i are of the opinion that Reuben did not sin. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua held that he did. <b>Rava said, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said:</b> Reverse the letters in <i>paḥaz</i> and interpret: <b>You remembered [<i>zakharta</i>] the punishment</b> for that offense, <b>you made yourself gravely ill [<i>ḥalita</i>]</b> in order to refrain from sinning, and <b>you</b> successfully <b>withdrew [<i>peirashta</i>] from sinning.</b>",
    "The Gemara prefaces the following statements of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani with a <b>mnemonic: Reuben, the sons of Eli, the sons of Samuel, David, Solomon, and Josiah.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who says that the sons of Eli sinned is nothing other than mistaken, as it is written: “And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Pinehas, were there priests of the Lord”</b> (I Samuel 1:3).",
    "The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yonatan <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as Rav said: Pinehas did not sin.</b> And the verse <b>juxtaposes Hophni to Pinehas; just as Pinehas did not sin, so too Hophni did not sin.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How,</b> then, <b>do I establish</b> the meaning of the verse: “Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and <b>how they lay with the women</b> that assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting” (I Samuel 2:22), which indicates otherwise? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the sons of Eli <b>delayed</b> sacrificing <b>the bird-offerings</b> of women who had given birth, a pair of doves brought as part of the purification process, and this delay caused the women <b>not to go to their husbands</b> in timely fashion, <b>the verse ascribes to</b> Hophni and Pinehas liability <b>as if they had lain with them.</b> They were guilty of nothing more than negligence and carelessness.",
    "The Gemara now examines <b>the matter itself</b> of Rav’s statement cited in the course of the previous discussion. <b>Rav said: Pinehas did not sin, as it is stated: “And Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Pinehas, the son of Eli, was the Lord’s priest</b> in Shiloh, wearing an ephod” (I Samuel 14:3). <b>Is it possible that sin came to</b> Pinehas’ <b>hand and,</b> nevertheless, <b>the verse traces the lineage</b> of his grandson, Ahijah, back <b>to him?</b>",
    "<b>Wasn’t it was already stated</b> with regard to those who engage in promiscuous relations: <b>“The Lord will cut off from the man that does this, him that is awake and him that answers from the tents of Jacob, or any to present an offering to the Lord of hosts”</b> (Malachi 2:12). The Sages interpreted the verse homiletically: <b>If</b> the sinner is <b>an Israelite, he will not have</b> among his descendants <b>one who is</b> sharp and <b>awake among the Sages, or</b> even <b>one among</b> their <b>disciples who can answer</b> questions. <b>And if he is a priest, he will not have a son who will present a meal-offering.</b> If Pinehas had sons and grandsons serving as priests, <b>conclude from it that Pinehas did not sin.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>However, isn’t it written: “And how they lay [<i>yishkevun</i>]</b> with the women.” The verb <i>yishkevun</i> is in the plural, indicating that both sons were guilty. The Gemara answers: It <b>is written</b> without a <i>vav</i> so that it can be read as <b><i>yishkeven</i></b> in the singular, i.e., how he lay, indicating that only one of them sinned.",
    "The Gemara asks further: <b>Isn’t it written</b> that Eli said: <b>“No, my sons [<i>banai</i>]; for it is not a good report</b> that I hear; you make the Lord’s people to transgress” (I Samuel 2:24). The fact that Eli referred to his sons in the plural indicates that they both sinned. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is written</b> in a manner that can be read as <b>my son [<i>beni</i>]</b> in the singular.",
    "The Gemara raises another question: <b>Isn’t it written: “You make</b> the Lord’s people <b>to transgress [<i>ma’avirim</i>]</b> in the plural, indicating that both sons were guilty. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> Here too, the word <b>is written</b> without a <i>yod</i> so that it can be read as: <b>You cause</b> the Lord’s people <b>to transgress [<i>ma’aviram</i>]</b> in the singular, indicating that only one of them sinned.",
    "The Gemara raises one last challenge: <b>Isn’t it written:</b> “Now the sons of Eli were <b>scoundrels;</b> they knew not the Lord” (I Samuel 2:12), indicating that they were both sinners. The Gemara answers: <b>Since Pinehas should have protested Hophni’s</b> conduct, <b>but he did not protest, the verse ascribes to him</b> liability <b>as if he</b> too <b>had sinned.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who says</b>"
