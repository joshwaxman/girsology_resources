    "Consequently, it should <b>also</b> be permitted <b>to send</b> to a gentile a thigh that has been <b>cut, because</b> Jews <b>will not come to purchase</b> it <b>from him. Rather,</b> if the mishna is referring <b>to a place where</b> all the butchers are Jewish, and <b>they announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i> to a gentile, in which case Jews may purchase meat from the local gentiles when such an announcement is not made, one should <b>not</b> be permitted <b>to send even a whole</b> thigh to a gentile, due to the concern <b>that</b> he might <b>cut it up and sell it to</b> Jews who would not realize that it still contains the sciatic nerve.",
    "The Gemara offers two answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i>; <b>and if you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i>.",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i>, and nevertheless it is permitted to send a whole thigh of meat to a gentile. There is no concern that the gentile will sell the thigh to a Jew, because the Jew <b>would know</b> that it is non-kosher by the manner of <b>cutting of the gentile.</b> Jewish butchers would cut the meat in a distinctive manner that would not be replicated by a gentile who cut the meat.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i>, and nevertheless it is prohibited to give the gentile a thigh that has been cut up. The Sages issued a <b>decree</b> against doing so, <b>lest he give it to</b> the gentile <b>in the presence of another Jew,</b> who will think that it is kosher and purchase it from the gentile.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that there is an entirely different reason why one may not send a gentile a cut-up thigh without removing the sciatic nerve: <b>Because he</b> thereby <b>deceives</b> the gentile. The gentile will think that the Jew has exerted himself to cut up the leg and remove the sciatic nerve and that although the Jew could have eaten the meat himself he decided to send it to the gentile. The gentile will therefore be more appreciative of the gift than he would be if he realized that the sciatic nerve had not been removed. This is <b>as Shmuel said: It is prohibited to deceive people, and even</b> to deceive <b>a gentile.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara points out that <b>this</b> ruling <b>of Shmuel was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference,</b> i.e., it was inferred based upon the following incident: <b>Shmuel was</b> once <b>crossing</b> a river <b>in a ferry [<i>mavra</i>]. He said to his attendant: Compensate the ferryman</b> with an appropriate gift. The attendant <b>compensated him, but</b> Shmuel <b>became angry</b> with his attendant.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Shmuel <b>became angry? Abaye said:</b> The compensation that the attendant gave the ferryman <b>was a chicken</b> that was <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, and he gave it to him as though it were a slaughtered,</b> kosher chicken. <b>Rava said:</b> Shmuel <b>told him to give</b> the ferryman wine <b>for drinking</b> in <b>an <i>anpaka</i>,</b> i.e., a utensil that holds a quarter-<i>log</i> and which was generally used for undiluted wine, <b>but he gave him diluted wine for drinking.</b> According to both Abaye and Rava, Shmuel was upset that his attendant deceived the gentile ferryman.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> Shmuel’s opinion was derived <b>by inference, what</b> of it? The story clearly demonstrates that according to Shmuel it is prohibited to deceive a gentile. The Gemara answers that it cannot be ascertained with certainty that this is the reason Shmuel became angry. <b>According to the one who said it was</b> a chicken that was <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> that was given as compensation, perhaps Shmuel became angry and <b>said to</b> his attendant: <b>Why did you retain</b> in your possession an animal that is <b>forbidden</b> for consumption? This could have led to a Jew accidentally eating it.",
    "Similarly, <b>according to the one who said</b> that Shmuel <b>told him to give</b> the ferryman wine <b>to drink</b> in <b>an <i>anpaka</i>,</b> since <b><i>anpaka</i> indicates undiluted</b> wine and the attendant gave the ferryman diluted wine, perhaps Shmuel became angry simply because his attendant disobeyed his instruction.",
    "§ Apropos the prohibition against acting deceitfully, the Gemara cites other statements on this topic. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A person may not importune [<i>yesarhev</i>] another to eat with him,</b> making it seem as though he genuinely wants his company, <b>but</b> in reality he entreats him only because <b>he knows that</b> the other <b>will not eat</b> with him, i.e., will not accept the invitation. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>one may not</b> send another person <b>many gifts</b> merely because <b>he knows that</b> the other <b>will not accept</b> them.",
    "<b>And one may not open barrels</b> of wine for a guest if they have already been <b>sold to a storekeeper, unless he notifies</b> the guest beforehand that the barrel had been sold. <b>And he may not say to</b> another: <b>Anoint</b> yourself with <b>oil,</b> and place <b>an empty</b> jug before him with the knowledge that he will not attempt to anoint himself. <b>But if</b> he does so <b>for</b> the guest’s <b>honor,</b> to show that he holds his guest in high esteem, rather than to deceive the guest so that he will feel indebted to him, <b>it is permitted.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Ulla happen</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Yehuda,</b> and Rav Yehuda <b>opened barrels</b> of wine <b>for</b> Ulla <b>that</b> had already been <b>sold to a storekeeper?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Yehuda <b>notified</b> Ulla that he was not opening the barrels especially for him. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Ulla is different</b> from an ordinary guest <b>because he was</b> very <b>dear to Rav Yehuda, so that even without this,</b> i.e., even if he had not already sold the barrels to a storekeeper, Rav Yehuda would have <b>opened</b> the barrels <b>for him.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not go to a house of mourning with a</b> wine <b>jug [<i>lagin</i>] in his hand that</b> is mostly empty and where the small amount of wine <b>rattles</b> about, because the mourner will think that his visitor is bringing him a full jug of wine. <b>And he may not fill up</b> that jug of wine with <b>water, because he</b> thereby <b>misleads</b> the mourner into thinking he has brought him a full jug of undiluted wine. <b>But if there is a crowd of people [<i>ḥever ir</i>]</b> and the guest wants to honor the mourner in their presence, <b>it is permitted.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not sell to another a sandal</b> made from the hide <b>of</b> an animal that <b>died</b> of natural causes <b>as</b> though it were a sandal made from the hide <b>of a healthy animal that was slaughtered.</b> This is prohibited <b>due to two factors: One, because he misleads</b> the customer into thinking that the leather is of higher quality than it really is; <b>and another, because of the danger</b> involved, as it is possible that the animal died from a snakebite and the poison seeped into the part of the animal’s hide from which the sandal is made.",
    "<b>And</b> furthermore <b>a person may not send a barrel of wine to another with oil floating at its mouth,</b> such that the recipient thinks that it is a barrel of oil. There was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> individual <b>who sent a barrel of wine to another with oil floating at its mouth, and that</b> recipient, thinking it was a barrel of oil, <b>went and invited guests</b> to share <b>it</b> with him, <b>and</b> the guests <b>arrived.</b> When the host went to bring them oil, <b>he found that it was</b> a barrel <b>of wine</b> rather than oil, <b>and</b> in his shame at not having oil for them, <b>he hanged himself</b> and died.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And guests are not permitted to give</b> some <b>of</b> the food <b>that is</b> placed <b>before them to the son or to the daughter of the host unless they</b> first <b>receive permission from the host.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> there was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> individual <b>who invited three guests during years of famine, and he had</b> enough <b>to place only three eggs before them. The son of the host came,</b> and <b>one of</b> the guests <b>took his portion and gave it to</b> the son. <b>And similarly the second</b> guest gave his portion to the son, <b>and similarly the third</b> guest. <b>The father of the child came and found that</b> his son was <b>holding one</b> egg <b>in his mouth and two in his hand.</b> The father became so angry with his son for taking all the food that <b>he hit</b> the son <b>to the ground, and</b> the son <b>died. When his mother saw</b> what had happened, <b>she ascended to the roof and fell</b> down to the ground <b>and died.</b> And when the father saw that both his son and his wife were dead <b>he also ascended to the roof and fell</b> down to the ground <b>and died.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: For this matter</b> of giving food to the child of the host, <b>three Jewish souls were killed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What does this</b> statement <b>teach us?</b> It is obvious from the incident that three people were killed. The Gemara answers: It teaches <b>that the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> taught by <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov.</b>",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who sends</b> a whole <b>thigh</b> of an animal <b>to another, he is not required to</b> first <b>remove the sciatic nerve from it.</b> This is because the recipient can see that it has not yet been removed and will not eat it until he removes the sciatic nerve himself. But if one sends a thigh that has been <b>cut</b> up, <b>he is required to</b> first <b>remove the sciatic nerve from it</b> so that the recipient does not eat it unwittingly. <b>And in</b> the case of one who sends a thigh to <b>a gentile,</b> regardless of <b>whether it is cut or whole he is not required to remove the sciatic nerve from it.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> it was <b>due to two factors</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may not sell</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses or <i>tereifot</i> to a gentile: One, because it misleads him,</b> as he thinks that it is kosher meat, which is more desirable; <b>and another</b> factor is the concern <b>lest</b> the gentile <b>then sell</b> the meat <b>to another Jew,</b> who will think it is kosher since it originally was sold by a Jew.",
    "<b>And</b> similarly, <b>a person may not say to a gentile: Purchase meat for me</b> from a Jewish butcher <b>with this dinar, due to two factors:</b>"
