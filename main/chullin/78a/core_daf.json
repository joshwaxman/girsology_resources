    "<b>that</b> the tree’s <b>strength will lessen.</b> It is possible that the tree shed its fruits prematurely due to excessive blossoming.

    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And he will cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), that a leper must publicize the fact that he is ritually impure. <b>He must announce</b> his pain <b>to the masses, and the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf.

    "<b>Ravina said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we hang bunches of</b> unripe <b>dates on a palm tree</b> that casts off its dates, despite the fact that this is the practice of the Amorites?

    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> in a single day <b>applies to sacrificial</b> animals? It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born</b>…but from the eighth day and forward it may be accepted for an offering…to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27), <b>and it is written</b> in the <b>following</b> verse: <b>“And whether it be a bull or a sheep, you shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day.”</b> The juxtaposition of the verses <b>teaches with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring that it applies to sacrificial</b> animals as well.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> since this prohibition is taught in the context of other <i>halakhot</i> of consecrated animals, perhaps <b>I will say: Yes,</b> it applies <b>to sacrificial</b> animals, but it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to non-sacred</b> animals. The Gemara explains: The repetitive phrase “and whether it be <b>a bull</b> or a sheep” in the second verse, when those types of animals, i.e., bulls and sheep, were already mentioned in the first verse, <b>interrupted the topic,</b> clarifying that the second verse is not referring to sacrificial animals.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, <b>I will say: Yes,</b> the prohibition applies <b>to non-sacred</b> animals, but it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to sacrificial</b> animals. The Gemara explains: Since in that verse <b>it is written: “And whether it be a bull</b>…you shall not slaughter it and its offspring,” the conjunction <b>“and” adds</b> the prohibition stated in the second verse <b>to the first matter,</b> including sacrificial animals as well.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> this prohibition also applies to sacrificial animals, perhaps <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> is <b>not</b> included, e.g., the offspring of a ewe and a goat is unfit to be an offering, <b>so too</b> with regard to the prohibition of: <b>A mother and its offspring,</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> should <b>not</b> be included, so that in the case of the offspring of a ewe and a goat, it would be permitted to slaughter the mother and offspring on the same day. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see <i>Tosefta</i> 5:1): The prohibition of: <b>A mother and its offspring, applies to</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds and to a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both domesticated and undomesticated animals?",
    "<b>And additionally,</b> why should the prohibition of: A mother and its offspring, apply to the offspring of diverse kinds? <b>“A sheep,” is written</b> in the verse with regard to that prohibition, <b>and Rava said</b>"
