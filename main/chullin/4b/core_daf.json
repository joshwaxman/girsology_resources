    "it is <b>permitted immediately, due to</b> the fact <b>that they exchange</b> the forbidden leavened bread in their possession with permitted leavened bread belonging to gentiles immediately after Passover.",
    "The Sages who cited this proof <b>assumed</b> that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion? They assumed it <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: Leavened bread</b> that was not eradicated before Passover is forbidden <b>after Passover by Torah law.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> nevertheless <b>it is taught</b> that it is permitted <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the transgressors <b>exchange</b> their leavened bread with that of gentiles. <b>Apparently,</b> even one who performs transgressions <b>does not</b> intentionally <b>forsake the permitted and eat forbidden</b> food, where the permitted food is easily accessible.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the <i>baraita</i> can this be proven? <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says: Leavened bread</b> that was not eradicated before Passover is prohibited <b>after Passover by rabbinic law. And</b> accordingly, <b>when we are lenient it is with regard to</b> prohibitions <b>by rabbinic law,</b> whereas <b>with regard to</b> prohibitions <b>by Torah law,</b> e.g., the prohibition of an unslaughtered carcass, <b>we are not lenient.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>And let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>be even</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. Does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach: As I say</b> that <b>they exchanged</b> their leavened bread for the leavened bread of a gentile, which would indicate that it is an assumption? <b>He teaches: Due to</b> the fact <b>that they exchange,</b> as a statement of fact, <b>as they certainly exchange. And if in</b> cases involving prohibitions <b>by rabbinic law</b> the transgressor <b>does not</b> intentionally <b>forsake the permitted and eat forbidden</b> food, then <b>in</b> prohibitions <b>by Torah law</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> reasonable that he would not forsake the permitted in favor of the forbidden?",
    "<b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rava: <b>Everyone slaughters, and even a Samaritan, and even an uncircumcised</b> man, <b>and even a Jewish transgressor.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>This uncircumcised</b> man, <b>what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he is an uncircumcised man <b>whose brothers died due to circumcision</b> and the concern is that he might suffer a similar fate, clearly he may slaughter, as <b>he is a full-fledged Jew</b> and not a transgressor at all. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he is <b>a transgressor with regard to</b> remaining <b>uncircumcised,</b> as he refuses to be circumcised, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that he may nevertheless slaughter an animal since <b>a transgressor concerning one matter is not a transgressor concerning the entire Torah.</b>",
    "<b>Say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And even a Jewish transgressor. This transgressor, what are the circumstances? If he is a transgressor concerning another matter</b> besides eating unslaughtered animal carcasses, <b>that is</b> identical to the case of <b>a transgressor with regard to</b> remaining <b>uncircumcised. Rather, is it not</b> that he is <b>a transgressor concerning the same matter</b> of eating unslaughtered carcasses, <b>and</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who said that one may even rely on the slaughter of a Jewish transgressor whose transgression is that he eats unslaughtered animal carcasses to satisfy his appetite, <i>ab initio</i>?",
    "The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No, actually I will say to you:</b> The slaughter of <b>a transgressor concerning the same matter</b> is <b>not</b> valid. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>since he has become accustomed to</b> performance of that transgression, it is <b>like a permitted</b> act <b>for him,</b> and the concern is that he is not at all careful to slaughter the animal properly. <b>Rather,</b> the transgressor mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Anan, as Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a Jew</b> who is <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship, it is permitted to eat from</b> what <b>he slaughters.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a Jew</b> who is <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship, it is permitted to eat from</b> what <b>he slaughters, as we found with regard to Jehoshaphat, king of Judea, who partook of the feast</b> prepared by <b>Ahab,</b> king of Israel, who was a transgressor with regard to idol worship, <b>as it is stated: “And Ahab slaughtered sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and incited him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead”</b> (II Chronicles 18:2).",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>And perhaps</b> Ahab <b>slaughtered</b> the animals, but Jehoshaphat <b>did not eat</b> the meat of those animals. The Gemara explains: <b>It is written: “And incited him,”</b> indicating that there was an element of persuasion that presumably involved food. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>And perhaps</b> Ahab incited him <b>with</b> his <b>words.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is no incitement with words.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>not</b> incitement with words? <b>But isn’t it written: “If your brother…entices you</b> secretly, saying: Let us go and serve other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:7)? The Gemara answers: There too the incitement is <b>with eating and with drinking.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> that God said to Satan, who denounced Job: <b>“And you incited Me against him, to destroy him gratuitously”</b> (Job 2:3)? Clearly Satan did not incite God with food and drink. The Gemara answers: Incitement against the One <b>on High is different,</b> as the term is used metaphorically. By contrast, incitement with regard to people involves food and drink.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>And perhaps</b> Jehoshaphat <b>drank</b> at the feast but <b>did not eat.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>What is different</b> about <b>drinking</b> wine with Ahab that it would be permitted? It would be permitted because <b>we say: A transgressor with regard to idol worship is not</b> considered <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah</b> and therefore his wine is not forbidden. With regard to <b>eating</b> a transgressor’s food <b>too, a transgressor with regard to idol worship is not</b> considered <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah.</b> Therefore, the meat of an animal that he slaughters is not forbidden.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b> With regard to <b>drinking,</b> Ahab’s wine <b>is</b> considered <b>ordinary wine</b> of gentiles, <b>and the ordinary wine of gentiles was not yet prohibited,</b> as the Sages issued that decree only several generations later. Therefore, it was permitted for Jehoshaphat to drink Ahab’s wine. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>eating, I will say to you: A transgressor with regard to idol worship is</b> considered <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah.</b> Therefore, it was prohibited for Jehoshaphat to eat the meat from the animals slaughtered by Ahab.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say:</b> It is clear that Jehoshaphat ate at the feast, as it is <b>not typical conduct of a king to drink</b> wine <b>without eating. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>“And</b> Ahab <b>slaughtered</b> sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, <b>and incited him,” is written,</b> indicating: <b>With what did</b> Ahab <b>incite</b> Jehoshaphat? It was <b>with slaughter</b> of an animal. Apparently, it is permitted to eat from an animal slaughtered by a transgressor with regard to idol worship.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps Obadiah,</b> who was the majordomo of Ahab’s household and a righteous man, <b>slaughtered</b> the animals. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>“In abundance” is written,</b> and <b>Obadiah would not have managed</b> to slaughter all the animals himself.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps</b> the <b>seven thousand</b> righteous people <b>slaughtered</b> the animals, <b>as it is written: “And I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal,</b> and every mouth that has not kissed it” (I Kings 19:18). The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>They were hiding from Jezebel,</b> Ahab’s wife, and would not have gone to the palace to slaughter animals for the feast.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps,</b> although Ahab was an idolater, <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Ahab were upstanding</b> people, not idolaters, and they slaughtered the animals. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “If a ruler hearkens to matters of falsehood, all his servants are wicked”</b> (Proverbs 29:12).",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps the men</b> in the employ <b>of Jehoshaphat were also not upstanding,</b> and the animals that <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Ahab slaughtered, the men</b> in the employ <b>of Jehoshaphat ate,</b> and the animals that <b>Obadiah slaughtered, Jehoshaphat ate.</b>",
    "The Gemara rejects that suggestion: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind; from</b> the fact <b>that</b> it is written: <b>“If a ruler hearkens to matters of falsehood, all his servants are wicked,”</b> it may be inferred that if a ruler hearkens <b>to matters of truth, all his servants are righteous.</b>",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps</b> the animals that <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Ahab slaughtered, Ahab and his men ate,</b> and the animals that <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Jehoshaphat slaughtered, Jehoshaphat and his men ate.</b>"
