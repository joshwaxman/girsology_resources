    "<b>but he does not bring</b> the <b>offering</b> for <b>impurity.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: From the words: But if he becomes impure he does not bring an offering for impurity, one can infer that <b>it is the offering that he does not bring. However,</b> all of the prohibitions of <b>naziriteship apply to him,</b> and it is prohibited for him to become impure from a corpse.",
    "This leads to the following question: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A nazirite</b> like <b>Samson is permitted to become impure from a corpse</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>as we find with Samson that he became impure. Rabbi Shimon says: One who says</b> he will be <b>a nazirite</b> like <b>Samson has not said anything, since we do not find with Samson that</b> an utterance of a vow of <b>naziriteship left his mouth.</b> Samson never took a vow to be a nazirite. He received his status from the angel’s instructions to his mother (see Judges 13:5). Consequently, Rabbi Shimon holds that one who vows to be a nazirite like Samson is not considered to have taken a nazirite vow.",
    "The Gemara explains the question: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the mishna? <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t he say</b> that it is permitted for a nazirite of this kind to become impure from a corpse <b>even <i>ab initio</i>, but the mishna teaches: If he becomes impure,</b> which indicates that he is prohibited from doing so <i>ab initio</i>? However, <b>if</b> you say that the mishna is according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, didn’t he say</b> that <b>naziriteship does not apply to him at all?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and a nazirite like Samson may become impure from a corpse even <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And since it teaches with regard to a permanent nazirite: If he becomes impure,</b> as it is prohibited for a permanent nazirite to become impure from a corpse <i>ab initio</i>, the <i>tanna</i> <b>also taught</b> the same expression <b>with regard to a nazirite</b> like <b>Samson</b> and used the expression: <b>If he becomes impure.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one says: This object <b>is hereby</b> forbidden <b>to me like a firstborn, Rabbi Ya’akov prohibits</b> the individual from deriving benefit from the object, as he holds that a vow of this sort is valid. <b>And Rabbi Yosei permits</b> it, because the sanctity of a firstborn is not the result of a vow or sanctification. Rather, it is sacred of its own accord, and therefore its forbidden status cannot be extended by means of a vow to other items.",
    "<b>What, is it not</b> the case that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, who said</b> that in order for a vow to take effect, <b>we do not require</b> one to extend the forbidden status of <b>an item</b> rendered forbidden by means of <b>a vow?</b> Consequently, just as one can render an object forbidden by extending to it the sanctity of a firstborn animal, one can become a nazirite by accepting upon himself the status of Samson, whose prohibitions were not established by a vow. <b>And Rabbi Shimon holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who said</b> that in order for a vow to take effect, <b>we do require</b> one to extend the forbidden status of <b>an item</b> rendered forbidden by means of <b>a vow.</b> Consequently, one cannot become a nazirite by accepting upon himself the status of Samson.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it can be explained <b>that everyone</b> agrees that <b>we require</b> one to extend the forbidden status of <b>an item</b> rendered forbidden by means of <b>a vow. And</b> according to Rabbi Ya’akov, the <i>halakha</i> <b>is different with regard to a firstborn, as it is written about</b> this in the verse pertaining to vows: “When a man vows a vow <b>to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 30:3). This comes <b>to include the firstborn</b> and teach that since the firstborn is consecrated, its status is comparable to animals designated as offerings by means of a vow, and one can extend its forbidden status to another item.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response that <b>he needs that</b> expression: <b>“To the Lord,” to include a sin-offering and a guilt-offering.</b> One may not obligate himself to bring these offerings by means of a vow. They are brought only when one becomes liable due to a transgression. Nevertheless, one can take a vow by extending to another item the forbidden status of a sin-offering or guilt-offering.",
    "The Gemara questions Rabbi Yosei’s explanation: <b>And what did you see</b> that indicated to you <b>to include a sin-offering and a guilt-offering and to exclude a firstborn?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>I include a sin-offering and a guilt-offering, as one grants</b> consecrated status to the animals designated for these offerings <b>by</b> means of <b>a vow,</b> i.e., the act of designating specific animals for these offerings is comparable to taking a vow. <b>And I exclude a firstborn, as one does not grant it</b> consecrated status <b>by</b> means of <b>a vow.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Ya’akov</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>Also</b> in the case of <b>a firstborn, one grants it</b> consecrated status <b>by</b> means of <b>a vow, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>of the house of our Rabbi,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> when <b>a firstborn</b> male animal <b>is born in one’s herd,</b> there is <b>a mitzva for him to consecrate it,</b> although it is consecrated from the time it is born? <b>As it is stated:</b> “All firstborns <b>males</b> that are born to your herd and to your flock <b>you shall sanctify”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19).",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>Granted that</b> there is <b>a mitzva to consecrate it.</b> But <b>if he does not consecrate it, is it not consecrated</b> of its own accord? Since a firstborn is forbidden principally because of its inherent sanctity and not because of a vow, one cannot express a vow by extending a firstborn’s forbidden status to another item.",
    "The Gemara asks: Both Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Yosei agree that the phrase “to the Lord” indicates that one can take a vow by associating the object of his vow with an item whose prohibition does not stem from a vow. <b>With regard to a nazirite as well, isn’t it written:</b> “Shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself <b>to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 6:2)? Why doesn’t Rabbi Shimon derive from this verse that one can become a nazirite by accepting the naziriteship of Samson, despite the fact that Samson did not accept his naziriteship by means of a vow?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase <b>is required by him for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaTzaddik said: In</b> all <b>my days</b> as a priest, <b>I never ate the guilt-offering of a ritually impure nazirite, apart from</b> the offering of <b>one man who came to me from the South,</b> who had <b>beautiful eyes and a fine countenance, and his locks were arranged in curls. I said to him: My son, what did you see</b> to become a nazirite, which would force you <b>to destroy this beautiful hair,</b> as a nazirite must cut off all his hair at the conclusion of his term?",
    "<b>He said to me: I was a shepherd for my father in my town, and I went to draw water from the spring, and I looked at my reflection</b> in the water. <b>And my</b> evil <b>inclination quickly</b> rose <b>against me and sought to drive me from the world. I said to</b> my evil inclination: <b>Empty one! For what</b> reason <b>are you proud in a world that is not yours, as your end is to be maggots and worms</b> when you die. I swear by <b>the</b> Temple <b>service that I will</b> become a nazirite and <b>shave you for</b> the sake of <b>Heaven.</b>",
    "Shimon HaTzaddik relates: When I heard his response, <b>I arose and kissed him on his head,</b> and <b>said to him: May there be more nazirites like you in Israel,</b> whose intentions are noble, and who would not regret their vow of naziriteship even if they became impure. <b>With regard to you the verse states: “When</b> either <b>a man</b> or a woman <b>shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 6:2). The verse speaks of a vow that is not undertaken out of anger or spite, but purely for the sake of God. The phrase “to the Lord” in this context means: For the sake of Heaven. It cannot be used to teach that if one declares his intention to become a nazirite like Samson, his statement constitutes a nazirite vow.",
    "The Gemara challenges the assumption that Samson’s naziriteship was not accepted through a vow: <b>And was Samson not a nazirite</b> whose naziriteship was accepted by a vow? <b>Isn’t it written: “For the child shall be a nazirite of God from the womb”</b> (Judges 13:5)? The Gemara answers: <b>There it was the angel who spoke.</b> Samson’s nazirite status did not stem from a vow uttered by a human being.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Samson <b>became impure from corpses? If we say</b> it is <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written:</b> “And Samson said: <b>With the jawbone of an ass, I smote a thousand men”</b> (Judges 15:16), <b>perhaps he thrust</b> the jawbone <b>at them but did not touch them,</b> and he remained pure.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And he smote thirty men of them, and took their garments”</b> (Judges 14:19). Since he stripped the clothes off the dead he must have come into contact with them. The Gemara counters: <b>Perhaps he stripped them first and afterward killed them.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>It is written: “And he smote…and took,”</b> in that order, indicating that first he killed them and then he took their clothing.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> he mortally wounded them and thereby <b>caused them</b> to be in the process of <b>dying,</b> and he then took their clothes before they died so that he would not touch their corpses. <b>Rather,</b> it must be concluded that <b>it is learned as a tradition</b> that Samson would become impure from corpses.",
    "§ The Gemara clarifies a <i>halakha</i> taught in the mishna: <b>And where is</b> the concept of <b>a permanent nazirite written? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Absalom was a permanent nazirite, as it is stated: “And it came to pass at the end of forty years, that Absalom said to the king: I pray to you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the Lord, in Hebron”</b> (II Samuel 15:7). <b>And he cut</b> his hair <b>once</b> every <b>twelve months, as it is stated:</b> “And when he polled his head, <b>now it was at every year’s [<i>yamim</i>] end</b> that he polled it; because the hair was heavy on him” (II Samuel 14:26)."
