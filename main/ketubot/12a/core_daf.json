    "<b>Rabba said: That is to say,</b> if <b>one married</b> a woman <b>with the presumptive status of a virgin,</b> as there were witnesses that she did not engage in intercourse, <b>and she was found</b> to be <b>a non-virgin, she is</b> entitled to <b>a marriage contract of one hundred dinars.</b> The Gemara rejects the proof. <b>Rav Ashi said: In general, actually, I</b> would <b>say to you</b> that in that case <b>she does not</b> receive a marriage contract <b>at all,</b> as it is a mistaken transaction. <b>But here it is different,</b> and she does not totally lose her marriage contract, <b>because the first</b> husband <b>brought her into</b> his house. Therefore, the second husband should have considered that a woman who entered her husband’s home is no longer a virgin.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> since there are witnesses that she did not engage in intercourse with the first husband, <b>let us be concerned that perhaps she committed adultery</b> after betrothal, <b>while under</b> the jurisdiction of the second husband, and rule that she is forbidden to him due to suspicion of adultery and is not entitled to a marriage contract at all. <b>Rav Sherevya said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he betrothed</b> her <b>and engaged in intercourse immediately.</b> Therefore, there was no opportunity to engage in adultery between her betrothal and her marriage to the second husband.",
    "<b>Others taught this</b> statement of Rabba <b>with regard to the mishna:</b> Concerning <b>a virgin</b> who is <b>a widow, a divorcée,</b> or <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i></b> who achieved that status <b>from</b> a state of <b>marriage,</b> for all these women <b>their marriage contract is one hundred dinars, and they are not subject</b> to <b>a claim</b> concerning their <b>virginity.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How can you find a virgin from</b> a state of <b>marriage?</b> It is in a case <b>where she entered the wedding canopy and did not engage in intercourse.</b>",
    "<b>Rabba said: That is to say,</b> if <b>one married</b> a woman <b>with the presumptive status of a virgin and she was found</b> to be <b>a non-virgin, her marriage contract is one hundred dinars.</b> The Gemara rejects the proof. <b>Rav Ashi said: In general, actually, I</b> would <b>say to you</b> that <b>in general, she does not</b> receive a marriage contract <b>at all,</b> as it is a mistaken transaction. <b>But here it is different,</b> and she does not totally lose her marriage contract, <b>because she entered the wedding canopy.</b> Therefore, the second husband should have considered that a woman who entered her husband’s home is no longer a virgin.",

    "The Gemara notes: <b>The one who taught</b> the exchange between Rabba and Rav Ashi <b>with regard to the <i>baraita</i>,</b> where there is explicit testimony that she did not engage in intercourse with the first husband and nevertheless no proof can be brought that if he discovers that she is not a virgin she receives a marriage contract of one hundred dinars, <b>all the more so</b> would he say that the same is true <b>with regard to the mishna.</b> And <b>the one who taught</b> the exchange <b>with regard to the mishna, however,</b> would <b>not</b> say the same <b>with regard to the <i>baraita</i>, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the husband could <b>say to her: I relied on witnesses.</b> Therefore, proof can be brought from the <i>baraita</i> that if he discovered that she is not a virgin, she receives a marriage contract of one hundred dinars.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A man <b>who eats at</b> the house of <b>his father-in-law in Judea</b> after betrothal and <b>without witnesses</b> to attest to the fact that he was not alone with his betrothed <b>is unable to make a claim concerning virginity</b> after marriage <b>because</b> in accordance with the custom in Judea, the assumption is <b>that he secluded himself with her,</b> and the concern is that it was he who engaged in intercourse with her.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> employing the phrase: A man <b>who eats, by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that there is also a place in Judea where</b> the groom <b>does not eat</b> at the house of his father-in-law, and does not enter into seclusion with his betrothed. <b>Abaye said: Conclude from it that in Judea too there are</b> different <b>places</b> with different customs, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: In Judea, at first they would seclude the groom and bride</b> together <b>for a brief period before their entry into the wedding canopy, so that he would</b> grow <b>accustomed to her</b> companionship in order to ease the awkwardness when they would consummate the marriage. <b>And in the Galilee they did not do so.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>In Judea, at first they would appoint for them two groomsmen [<i>shushvinin</i>], one for him and one for her, in order to examine the groom and the bride at the time of their entry into the wedding canopy</b> and thereafter, to ensure that neither would engage in deception with regard to the presence or absence of blood from the rupture of the hymen. <b>And in the Galilee they would not do so.</b> As the custom of appointing groomsmen would be relevant only in a case where the groom and the bride had not been together in seclusion prior to marriage, this is apparently a custom in Judea different from the first custom cited in the mishna, where they would enter into seclusion prior to marriage.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>In Judea, at first the groomsmen would sleep in the house in which the groom and bride sleep,</b> in order to examine the sheet on which the marriage was consummated immediately following intercourse. This was in order to ensure that the groom would not attempt to obscure the blood of the rupture of the hymen and claim that the bride was not a virgin. <b>And in the Galilee they would not do so.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And anyone who did not conduct</b> himself <b>in accordance with this custom cannot make a claim concerning virginity</b> against the bride. The Gemara asks: <b>Concerning which</b> case in the <i>baraita</i> was this principle stated? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>concerning the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, regarding the custom to seclude the couple prior to marriage, in that case, the phrase: <b>Anyone who conducted</b> himself in accordance with this custom cannot make a claim concerning virginity, is what <b>it needed to say,</b> due to the concern that perhaps they had sexual relations before the marriage.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>concerning the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: They would appoint for them two groomsmen to examine them, that the principle was stated. In that case, the phrase: <b>Anyone who was not examined</b> by the groomsmen, is what <b>it needed</b> to say, as it is dependent on the family of the bride, and not the phrase: Anyone who did not conduct himself in accordance with this custom, which indicates that it depends on him.",
    "<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> the principle is stated <b>concerning the first clause; and</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> <b>and teach: Anyone who conducted</b> himself in accordance with this custom. <b>Rava said to him: But isn’t it teaching</b> explicitly: <b>Anyone who did not conduct</b> himself in accordance with this custom? One should not corrupt a <i>baraita</i> due to a difficulty that arose in understanding it. <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Anyone who did not practice the custom of the Galilee in the Galilee, but</b> instead observed <b>the custom of Judea in the Galilee, cannot make a claim concerning virginity</b> against the bride. <b>Rav Ashi said: Actually,</b> this principle could be applied <b>concerning the latter clause, and teach: Anyone who was not examined.</b> When it said in the <i>baraita</i>: Anyone who did not conduct himself in accordance with this custom, it is referring to the custom of being examined.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <b>both a widow</b> who is <b>an Israelite woman and a widow</b> who is the daughter <b>of priests, her marriage contract is one hundred dinars. A court of priests would collect</b> a marriage contract of <b>four hundred dinars for a virgin</b> daughter of a priest, twice the sum of the standard marriage contract for a virgin, <b>and the Sages did not reprimand them.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> for <b>a widow</b> who is the daughter <b>of priests, her marriage contract is two hundred</b> dinars. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: For <b>both a widow</b> who is <b>an Israelite woman and a widow</b> who is the daughter <b>of priests, their marriage contract is one hundred dinars?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said: There were two ordinances</b> instituted: <b>Initially, the</b> court of priests <b>instituted for a virgin</b> daughter of a priest a marriage contract of <b>four hundred dinars, and for a widow,</b> a marriage contract of <b>one hundred dinars.</b>"
