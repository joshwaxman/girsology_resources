    "<b>Wines are not allotted to a wife. And if you say</b> that in the verse: <b>“I will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink”</b> (Hosea 2:7), “drink [<i>shikkuyai</i>]” is apparently a reference to wine, which indicates that it is usual for a woman to receive wine, this is invalid, since actually <i>shikkuyai</i> is not referring to wine but rather to <b>items that a woman desires [<i>mishtokeket</i>]. And what are these? Jewelry</b> or other ornaments, not wine.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehuda of the village of Neviraya, and some say of the village of Nefor Ḥayil, interpreted</b> a verse: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not allot wines for a woman? As it is stated: “So Hannah rose up after she had eaten in Shiloh and after he had drunk”</b> (I Samuel 1:9). It states: <b>“He had drunk,” and not: She had drunk.</b> This teaches that although she ate, she did not drink wine.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>However, if that is so,</b> by the same reasoning, should the phrase <b>“she had eaten,”</b> which is in the feminine, <b>indeed</b> be interpreted to mean that only she ate, <b>and</b> that <b>he did not eat?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> this interpretation <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the verse changed its language. Since</b> the verse <b>was already dealing with her, what is the reason</b> that it <b>changed</b> the terminology and did not state: And had drunk, in the feminine? One can <b>learn from this</b> that <b>“he had drunk”</b> means that he drank, <b>but she did not drink.</b>",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman is <b>accustomed</b> to wine, <b>she is given</b> wine. The Gemara explains: If the woman is <b>accustomed</b> to wine it <b>is different, as Rav Ḥinnana bar Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> If a woman is <b>accustomed</b> to drinking wine, <b>she is given one cup,</b> and if she <b>is not accustomed</b> to wine, <b>she is given two cups.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Shmuel <b>saying?</b> His statement is the opposite of what one would logically expect. <b>Abaye said: This is what</b> he <b>is saying:</b> If <b>she is accustomed</b> to wine, then <b>in the presence of her husband</b> she is given <b>two cups,</b> and if she <b>is not in the presence of her husband she is given one cup.</b> If <b>she is not accustomed</b> to drinking wine, then <b>in the presence of her husband</b> she is given <b>only one cup,</b> and if she <b>is not in the presence of her husband she is not given</b> wine <b>at all.</b>",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: If <b>she is accustomed</b> to wine, <b>she is given</b> wine, but not for drinking, rather <b>for</b> meat <b>pudding [<i>tzikei</i>],</b> made with wine, flour, and leftover meat <b>in a pot. As Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving the daughter-in-law of Nakdimon ben Guryon,</b> whose husband had died. <b>The Sages apportioned for her</b> from his estate <b>two <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>wine for pudding, from one Shabbat eve to another. She said to them,</b> as a blessing out of gratitude: <b>So may you apportion for your</b> own <b>daughters</b> an amount as large as this. It was <b>taught: She was a widow waiting for her <i>yavam</i>, and</b> consequently, <b>the Sages did not answer amen after her</b> blessing, as they did not want their daughters to reach her unfortunate state.",
    "It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One cup</b> of wine is <b>good for a woman; two</b> cups <b>is a disgrace,</b> as she will start to become drunk; after <b>three</b> cups, she will become lustful and <b>verbally request</b> sexual intercourse, which is unseemly; after <b>four</b> cups of wine, she will <b>even request</b> intercourse from <b>a donkey in the marketplace, as</b> at this stage she is so drunk that <b>she is not particular</b> about with whom she has relations. <b>Rava said: They taught</b> that a woman should not drink much wine <b>only if her husband is not with her. However,</b> if <b>her husband is with her, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b> If she feels an urge for intercourse her husband is available.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> the case of <b>Hannah was</b> one <b>in which her husband was with her,</b> and yet this episode is cited as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that a woman should not drink wine. The Gemara answers: The case of <b>a guest is different, as Rav Huna said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a guest is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>conjugal relations? As it is stated: “And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the Lord, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah; and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her”</b> (I Samuel 1:19). This verse indicates that <b>now,</b> after they returned home, <b>yes,</b> they engaged in relations; <b>at the outset,</b> when they were still in Shiloh, <b>no,</b> they did not. Therefore, Hannah did not drink wine in Shiloh.",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>Abaye’s wife, Ḥoma, came before Rava</b> after Abaye died, as Rava was the local judge. <b>She said to him: Apportion sustenance for me,</b> as I am entitled to be sustained by Abaye’s heirs. Rava <b>apportioned</b> sustenance <b>for her.</b> She subsequently said to him: <b>Apportion wine for me</b> as well. Rava <b>said to her: I know that Naḥmani,</b> i.e., Abaye, <b>did not drink wine.</b> Since you were not accustomed to drinking wine during your husband’s lifetime, you are not entitled to it after his death. <b>She said to him: By the Master’s life,</b> this is not correct. In fact, <b>he would give</b> me wine <b>to drink in cups [<i>shufrazei</i>] as large as this.</b> She gestured with her hands to show how large the cups were. <b>While she was showing him</b> the size of the cups, <b>her arm became uncovered,</b> and she was so beautiful that it was as though <b>a light had shined in the courtroom.</b>",
    "<b>Rava arose, went home,</b> and <b>requested</b> intercourse <b>from</b> his wife, the <b>daughter of Rav Ḥisda.</b> The <b>daughter of Rav Ḥisda said to him: Who was</b> just <b>now in the courtroom?</b> Noticing his unusual behavior, she suspected that there must have been a woman in the court. <b>He said to her: Ḥoma, Abaye’s wife,</b> was there. Upon hearing this, Rava’s wife <b>went after</b> Ḥoma and <b>struck her with the lock of a chest [<i>kulpei deshida</i>] until she drove her out of the entire</b> city of <b>Meḥoza, saying to her: You have</b> already <b>killed three</b> men, as Abaye was your third husband, <b>and</b> now <b>you come to kill another</b> one, my husband Rava? Since you showed him your beauty, he will want to marry you.",
    "The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>The wife of Rav Yosef, son of Rava, came before Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef,</b> for judgment. <b>She said to him: Apportion sustenance for me.</b> Rav Neḥemya <b>apportioned</b> a certain amount of sustenance <b>for her. She said to him: Apportion wine for me</b> as well. <b>He apportioned</b> wine <b>for her. He said to her: I know that the residents of Meḥoza</b> are accustomed to <b>drinking wine,</b> and therefore you, too, are entitled to wine, in accordance with the local custom.",
    "Similarly, <b>the wife of Rav Yosef, son of Rav Menashya of D’vil, came before Rav Yosef. She said to him: Apportion sustenance for me. He apportioned</b> sustenance <b>for her.</b> She added: <b>Apportion wine for me. He apportioned</b> wine <b>for her.</b> She continued: <b>Apportion silk</b> garments <b>for me.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to her: Why</b> do you need <b>silk</b> garments? <b>She said to him: For you, for your friends, and for your friends’ friends.</b> Even as a widow, I should not have to be ashamed in front of you and your colleagues.",
    "§ The mishna taught: <b>And he</b> must <b>give her a bed, a soft mat,</b> and a hard mat. The Gemara asks: <b>Why does he</b> need <b>to give her a soft mat and</b> a hard <b>mat</b> if she already has a bed? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The mishna is speaking <b>of a place where it is the custom to fill a bed with ropes. Because</b> these ropes cause her suffering and <b>age [<i>mevager</i>] her,</b> she covers them with a mat, which serves as a kind of mattress upon which she can lie in comfort.",
    "<b>The Sages taught: One does not give</b> a poor woman <b>a pillow and a cushion. In the name of Rabbi Natan, they said: One</b> does <b>give her a pillow and a cushion.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If it is her</b> usual <b>manner</b> to use a pillow and cushion, <b>what is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> that she is not given these items? <b>And if it is not her</b> usual <b>manner, what is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> it is <b>his manner</b> to use a pillow and cushion, <b>but</b> it is <b>not her manner. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the husband <b>says to her: When I go away</b> from you, <b>I will take</b> my bedding with me, <b>and when I come</b> back <b>I will bring it with me. And Rabbi Natan holds</b> that <b>she</b> can <b>say to him: Sometimes it happens</b> that you arrive <b>at twilight and you are unable to bring it</b> with you, <b>and you</b> will <b>take my</b> bedding <b>and you</b> will <b>make me lie on the ground.</b> Therefore, I require extra pillows and cushions.",
    "§ The mishna further taught: <b>And he</b> must <b>give her a cap,</b> and shoes every Festival, and clothes once a year. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b>"
