    "<b>What</b> is the purpose of emphasizing: <b>To the place where her mother</b> lives? <b>Conclude from here</b> that a <b>daughter</b> lives <b>with</b> her <b>mother;</b> it is <b>no different</b> if she is <b>an adult woman, and</b> it is <b>no different</b> if she is <b>a minor girl.</b>",
    "§ It was taught in the mishna that if two men are obligated to support this girl, <b>both of them may not</b> jointly <b>say</b> that they will be partners in her support. Rather, each one fulfills his obligation independently.",
    "The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain man who rented out a millstone to another for</b> the price of <b>grinding,</b> i.e., the one who rented the millstone was to pay the cost of the rental by grinding whatever the owner needed to be ground. <b>In the end,</b> the owner of the millstone <b>became rich,</b> and <b>he purchased</b> another <b>millstone and a donkey,</b> and he no longer required the services of the renter to grind things for him.",
    "The owner of the millstone <b>said to</b> the renter: <b>Until now I would</b> have what I needed <b>ground by you,</b> and the service that you provided was in place of payment for the rental of the millstone. <b>Now,</b> since I no longer require this service, <b>give me payment</b> for the millstone. The renter <b>said</b> back <b>to him: I will grind for you</b> because that is what I agreed to, but I did not agree to have to pay money.",
    "<b>Ravina thought to say</b> that <b>this is the same as the mishna</b> that states that <b>both of them may not</b> jointly <b>say: We will sustain</b> the girl <b>as one</b> in a partnership. <b>Rather, one sustains her,</b> providing her with food, while <b>the other gives her the monetary</b> value <b>of the sustenance.</b> In that case, although the original condition was to provide the girl with support in the form of food, when circumstances changed, the previous husband became obligated to pay her support in the form of money. So too here, due to the change in circumstances, the renter should pay the owner of the millstone with money.",
    "<b>Rav Avira said to</b> Ravina: <b>Are the</b> two cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of the girl, <b>she has</b> only <b>one stomach; she does not have two stomachs.</b> Therefore, it is impossible for both of them to support her with food. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the millstone, the renter <b>is able to say to him: Grind and sell, grind and store</b> for later use, i.e., the owner of the millstone can use his new millstone to grind for others at a profit, and at the same time the renter will continue grinding the owner’s grain as per their agreement. Therefore, the renter is not obligated to change the terms of the original agreement.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>We said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the renter <b>does not have</b> any other <b>grinding</b> to do <b>with the millstone</b> and without the grinding that the renter does for the owner the mill will remain inoperative. <b>However,</b> if <b>he has</b> other <b>grinding</b> to do <b>with the millstone,</b> i.e., instead of grinding the owner’s grain he can grind the grain of others for a fee and thereby pay money for his rental, in a case <b>such as this one forces him</b> to cease his <b>conduct</b> characteristic <b>of Sodom</b> and to pay his rental fee in the form of money.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a widow who said: I do not want to move from my husband’s house,</b> but instead I wish to remain there, <b>the heirs are not able to say to her: Go to your father’s house and we will sustain you. Rather, they sustain her</b> in her husband’s house <b>and they give her living quarters befitting her dignity.</b>",
    "However, if <b>she said: I do not want to move from my father’s house,</b> and you should bring me my support there, <b>the heirs are able to say to her: If you are</b> living <b>with us, you</b> will <b>have sustenance</b> from us, <b>but if you are not</b> living <b>with us, you</b> will <b>not have sustenance</b> from us.",
    "<b>If she argued</b> that she does not wish to live in her deceased husband’s house <b>because she is young, and they,</b> the heirs, <b>are</b> also <b>young,</b> and it is improper for them to be living in the same house together, then <b>they sustain her and she</b> stays <b>in her father’s house.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> A widow that remains in her husband’s house <b>uses the living quarters in the</b> same <b>manner that she</b> would <b>use</b> them <b>in her husband’s lifetime.</b> She uses <b>the slaves and the maidservants in the</b> same <b>manner that she</b> would <b>use</b> them <b>in her husband’s lifetime, the pillows and the sheets in the</b> same <b>manner that she</b> would <b>use</b> them <b>in her husband’s lifetime,</b> and <b>the silver utensils and gold utensils in the</b> same <b>manner that she</b> would <b>use</b> them <b>in her husband’s lifetime.</b> She maintains all the rights she had during her husband’s lifetime <b>because this</b> is what <b>he wrote to her</b> in the text of the marriage contract: <b>And you will reside in my house and be sustained from my property all the days that you live in my house as a widow.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Yosef taught:</b> The husband stipulated in the marriage contract: You will reside <b>in my house,</b> with the implication: <b>And not in my hut.</b> Therefore, if the house is too small, she cannot obligate the heirs to allow her to live in the house with them.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman said: Orphans who sold the living quarters of a widow did not do anything,</b> i.e., the sale is invalid.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way is this case <b>different from that which Rabbi Asi</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said? As Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>orphans who preemptively sold from the small quantity of property</b> left to them by their father before the court appropriated it for the purpose of providing for female children, who do not inherit, <b>what they sold is sold,</b> even though they acted improperly. Why, then, is the sale of a widow’s living quarters invalid?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of orphans selling property that according to <i>halakha</i> should be retained in order to support the orphaned daughters, the property <b>is not mortgaged to</b> the orphaned daughters <b>from</b> the <b>lifetime</b> of their father, since the lien on the property arising from the obligation to provide support for the daughters occurs only after the father’s death. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the widow’s living quarters, the property is <b>mortgaged to her from</b> the <b>lifetime</b> of her husband, who was obligated even while he was alive to provide her with a place to live.",
    "<b>Abaye said: We hold</b> on the authority of tradition that in the case of <b>a widow’s living quarters that collapsed, the heirs are not obligated to rebuild it,</b> since they are obligated to maintain her in the residence that was mortgaged to her and are not required to provide her with a place to live.",
    "<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a widow’s living quarters that collapsed, the heirs are not obligated to rebuild it. And not only</b> this, <b>but</b> even <b>if she says: Leave me</b> be <b>and I will rebuild it from my own</b> funds, <b>one does not listen to her,</b> and the heirs do not have to let her rebuild it.",
    "<b>Abaye raised a dilemma:</b> If <b>she repaired</b> the house, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it as though the house collapsed and was rebuilt, in which case she no longer has rights to it, or may she stay in the house as long as it remains standing? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
    "§ We learned in the mishna: If <b>she said: I do not want</b> to move from my father’s house and you should bring me my support there, the heirs are not obligated to support her.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why is this so? <b>They should give her</b> support just <b>as</b> they would if <b>she were living there,</b> i.e., in her husband’s house. The Gemara answers: This <b>supports</b> the view of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna said: The blessing of the house is in its abundance</b> of residents. This means that the amount of blessing in a home is proportionate to the number of people who live there. When there are many people living together in one home, the expenses per capita are decreased. The heirs can say to her that if she stays with them in the house, the expense of her upkeep will be less than if she lives on her own.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And they should give her</b> the support in her father’s house <b>according to the blessing of the house,</b> i.e., according to the amount they would be required to pay if she lived with them. The Gemara answers: <b>Indeed,</b> the intent of the mishna is that they may pay her this amount, not that they may entirely avoid supporting her.",
    "<b>Rav Huna said:</b> The <b>language of the Sages</b> teaches <b>blessing,</b> the <b>language of the Sages</b> teaches <b>wealth,</b> and the <b>language of the Sages</b> teaches <b>healing.</b> One can learn important lessons about these matters from the manner in which the Sages formulated their halakhic rulings. How is this so? With regard to <b>blessing,</b> it is <b>that which we said</b> above about the blessings of the home.",
    "The language of the Sages teaches about <b>wealth, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 84b): <b>One who sells produce to another,</b> if the buyer <b>pulled</b> the produce as an act of acquisition <b>but did not measure</b> it, <b>he has acquired</b> the produce. If <b>he measured</b> the produce <b>but did not pull</b> it, <b>he has not acquired</b> it. <b>And if</b> the buyer <b>was perspicacious</b> and wanted to ensure that the seller would not back out of the deal, he would <b>rent the place</b> where the produce was located, and he would thereby acquire the produce immediately from the time he measures it. This mishna teaches good counsel in money-related matters.",
    "The language of the Sages teaches about <b>healing, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 39b): <b>A person should not chew wheat and</b> then <b>place it on his wound during Passover because</b> the wheat <b>will become leavened</b> as a result. This comment of the Sages indicates that chewed wheat is beneficial for treating a wound.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught: At the time of the passing of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>he said: I need my sons. His sons entered his</b> room. <b>He said to them</b> as a last will and testament: <b>Be careful with the honor of your mother.</b> He said further: My <b>lamp should be lit in its</b> usual <b>place,</b> my <b>table should be set in its</b> usual <b>place,</b> and <b>the bed should be arranged in its</b> usual <b>place. Yosef Ḥeifani</b> and <b>Shimon Efrati; they served me during my lifetime and they will serve me in my death.</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies the various requests that he made of his sons: <b>Be careful with the honor of your mother.</b> The Gemara asks: Why would he need to say this? After all, <b>this</b> is required <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is written: “Honor your father and your mother”</b> (Exodus 20:11)? The Gemara answers: <b>She was</b> their <b>father’s wife.</b> She was not their mother, but their stepmother, and he therefore needed to caution them concerning her honor.",
    "The Gemara asks: Honoring <b>a father’s wife is also</b> required <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Honor your father [<i>et avikha</i>] and your mother [<i>ve’et immekha</i>].</b> The preposition <i>et</i> in the phrase: <b>Your father; this</b> teaches that you must honor <b>your father’s wife.</b> Similarly, the preposition <i>et</i> in the phrase: <b>And your mother; this</b> teaches that you must honor <b>your mother’s husband.</b> And <b>the extra</b> letter <b><i>vav</i>,</b> which is appended as a prefix in the phrase “<i>ve’et immekha</i>” is included in order <b>to add your older brother</b> to those who must be honored.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one is obligated by Torah law to respect his father’s wife, <b>applies</b> only <b>during</b> his father’s <b>lifetime.</b> While the father is alive, out of respect for him, his wife must also be treated with respect. <b>However, following</b> his <b>death, no,</b> there is no longer any obligation to honor a stepmother. It was for this reason that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi had to caution his sons in this matter.",
    "Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi commanded his sons: My <b>lamp should be lit in its</b> usual <b>place,</b> my <b>table should be set in its</b> usual <b>place,</b> and <b>the bed should be arranged in its</b> usual <b>place.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> he made these requests? The Gemara explains: <b>Every Shabbat eve,</b> even after his passing, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>would come to his house</b> as he had done during his lifetime, and he therefore wished for everything to be set up as usual.",
    "The Gemara relates the following incident: It happened on <b>a certain Shabbat eve</b> that a <b>neighbor came</b> by and <b>called</b> and knocked <b>at the door. His maidservant said</b> to her: <b>Be quiet, for Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is sitting. When he heard</b> his maidservant reveal his presence to the neighbor, <b>he did not come again, so as not to cast aspersions on earlier righteous</b> individuals who did not appear to their families following their death.",
    "The Gemara elaborates on Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement: <b>Yosef Ḥeifani</b> and <b>Shimon Efrati, they served me during my lifetime and they will serve me in my death.</b> It was <b>understood from</b> this statement that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>was speaking of this world,</b> that these two should serve him in his death and administer his burial. However, <b>when they saw that their biers preceded his bier,</b> i.e., they died before him, <b>they said: Conclude from here that he was speaking of that world.</b> They will attend to him in the World-to-Come.",
    "<b>And the</b> reason <b>he said this</b> was so that <b>people should not say: There was something</b> wrong <b>with them, and until now, too, it was the merit of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>that benefited them</b> and prevented them from dying due to their sins. Now that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is dying, his merit no longer protects them. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi therefore clarified that the reason for their deaths was in order to enable them to escort him in death as in life.",
    "§ Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> further <b>to</b> his attendants: <b>I need the Sages of Israel. The Sages of Israel entered his</b> room. <b>He said to them: Do not eulogize me in the</b> small <b>towns</b>"
