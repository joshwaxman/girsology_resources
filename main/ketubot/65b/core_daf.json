    "<b>This <i>tanna</i></b> creates a bizarre situation in which the woman is <b>left naked but wearing shoes,</b> as the husband must give his wife shoes three times a year but new clothing only once a year. Abaye <b>said to him: The <i>tanna</i> is standing,</b> i.e., speaking of, <b>a mountainous region, in which she cannot do without three pairs of shoes,</b> as shoes wear out quickly in hilly areas. <b>And in passing,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that he should give them to her on a Festival, so that she will rejoice in them</b> during the Festival.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And he</b> must <b>give her clothes</b> with a value <b>of fifty dinars. Abaye said:</b> This is referring to <b>fifty simple [<i>peshitei</i>] dinars,</b> used as the money of the state, which are worth only one-eighth of Tyrian dinars. <b>From where</b> did Abaye derive this? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it teaches: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>with</b> regard to <b>the poorest of Jews. However,</b> in the case <b>of a prominent man, all</b> the amounts are increased <b>in accordance with his prominence. And if it enters your mind</b> that the mishna means <b>literally fifty dinars, from where</b> would such <b>a poor man</b> get <b>fifty dinars?</b> How could a pauper afford to give such a large sum to his wife for her clothing? <b>Rather, learn from this</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>fifty simple dinars.</b>",
    "§ The mishna further states: <b>And he may not give her new</b> clothes in the summer, nor worn garments in the rainy season, and the leftover, worn clothes belong to her. <b>The Sages taught: Leftover sustenance</b> belongs <b>to the husband,</b> whereas <b>leftover, worn clothes</b> belong <b>to the wife.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to the statement that <b>worn clothes</b> belong <b>to the wife, why</b> does <b>she</b> need these old clothes? <b>Raḥava said:</b> She requires them, <b>as she covers herself with them during her days of menstruation, so that she does not become repulsive to her husband.</b> If she wears her normal clothes when she is menstruating, he will later be disgusted by her.",
    "<b>Abaye said: We have a tradition</b> that the <b>leftover, worn clothes</b> of <b>a widow</b> belong <b>to</b> the husband’s <b>heirs.</b> The reason is that <b>it is</b> only in that case <b>there,</b> concerning a woman whose husband is alive, that the reasoning <b>so that she does not become repulsive to her husband</b> can be applied. Whereas <b>here,</b> when he is dead, <b>let her become repulsive.</b> There is no need to ensure that she find favor in the eyes of his heirs.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that <b>he gives her a silver <i>ma’a</i>,</b> and she eats with him from one Shabbat evening to the next. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>She eats,</b> in this context? <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> It means <b>literally</b> that <b>she eats</b> with him once a week. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is referring to <b>sexual relations.</b>",
    "<b>The mishna states: And she eats with him</b> from <b>Shabbat evening</b> to Shabbat evening. <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that it means actual <b>eating, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which is taught: She eats. However, according to the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>sexual relations, what is</b> the meaning of: <b>She eats?</b> The Gemara explains: It is <b>a euphemism, as it is written:</b> “So is the way of an adulterous woman; <b>she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says: I have done no wickedness”</b> (Proverbs 30:20).",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says,</b> disagreeing with the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna: <b>She eats on Shabbat evening and</b> on <b>Shabbat. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that it means actual <b>eating, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which is taught: And Shabbat,</b> i.e., she dines with him also on the day of Shabbat. <b>However, according to the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>sexual relations, are there sexual relations on</b> the day of <b>Shabbat? But didn’t Rav Huna say: The Jewish people are holy and</b> therefore <b>do not engage in sexual relations during the day?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rava said:</b> If they are <b>in a dark house, it is permitted</b> to engage in relations even during the day.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if she is nursing,</b> the required amount is reduced from her earnings and is added to the sum she receives for her sustenance. <b>Rabbi Ulla the Great taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>: Although</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>a person is not</b> obligated <b>to sustain his sons and daughters when they are young, still, he</b> must <b>sustain the very young ones.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Until when</b> are they considered very young? <b>Until the age of six, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi, as Rav Asi said: A six-year-old minor may go out by</b> means of <b>his mother’s <i>eiruv</i>,</b> if she prepared an <i>eiruv</i> on one side of the city. He is included in his mother’s <i>eiruv</i> rather than that of his father, as he is considered subordinate to his mother.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Ulla taught derived? The Gemara explains that it is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches: If she is nursing,</b> the required amount <b>is reduced from her earnings and is added</b> to the sum she receives <b>for her sustenance. What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not because</b> the baby <b>needs to eat</b> together <b>with her?</b> This shows that a father is responsible to provide for his young child. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps</b> he increases her sustenance not due to the baby but <b>because she is</b> considered <b>ill</b> due to her weakness while nursing, in which case the obligation stems from his obligation to his wife, not to his child.",
    "The Gemara retorts: <b>If so, let</b> the mishna <b>teach: If she was ill. What</b> is the reason that it specifies: <b>If she was nursing?</b> The reason for this <i>halakha</i> must certainly be due to the child. The Gemara again rejects this answer: <b>But perhaps</b> the mishna <b>teaches us this,</b> that in an <b>ordinary</b> situation, <b>nursing women are</b> considered <b>ill,</b> and that a husband must increase the sustenance all the more so if his wife is actually ill. Consequently, this does not prove that a father is obligated to sustain his very young child. <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Wine is added for</b> a nursing woman, <b>as wine is good for milk.</b>",
    "May we return to you chapter “Even though.”",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A lost <b>object found by a wife and</b> the wife’s <b>earnings</b> belong <b>to her husband. And</b> with regard to <b>her inheritance,</b> the husband <b>enjoys the profits</b> of this property <b>in her lifetime.</b> If she is humiliated or injured, the perpetrator is liable to pay compensation for <b>her humiliation and her degradation,</b> as relevant. This payment belongs <b>to her.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: When</b> it is an injury <b>that</b> is <b>in a concealed</b> part of the woman’s body, <b>she</b> receives <b>two parts,</b> i.e., two-thirds, of the payment for humiliation and degradation, <b>and</b> the husband receives <b>one</b> part, i.e., one-third, as the injury affects him as well. <b>And when</b> it is an injury <b>that</b> is <b>in an exposed</b> part of her body, <b>he</b> receives <b>two parts,</b> as he suffers public humiliation due to her condition, <b>and she</b> receives <b>one</b> part. <b>His</b> payment <b>should be given</b> to him <b>immediately. And</b> with <b>her</b> portion, <b>land should be purchased with it, and he enjoys the profits</b> of that property.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mishna <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (46b) that <b>the father is entitled, in</b> the case of <b>his daughter, to</b> authority over <b>her betrothal,</b> whether it is effected <b>with money, with a document, or through sexual intercourse.</b> Furthermore, as long as she is single, her father <b>is entitled to</b> any lost <b>object</b> that <b>she finds, and to her earnings, and to</b> effect <b>nullification of her vows</b> (see Numbers, chapter 30). Her father also <b>receives her bill of divorce</b> on her behalf, <b>but he does not enjoy the profits</b> of her property <b>in her lifetime.</b> If <b>she is married, the</b> rights of the <b>husband are greater than his, as</b> the husband <b>enjoys the profits</b> of her property <b>in her lifetime.</b> What, then, is the mishna teaching beyond that which was taught elsewhere?",
    "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention the <i>halakhot</i> concerning compensation for <b>her humiliation and her degradation,</b> as ownership of these payments is subject to <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and the Rabbis.</b>",
    "§ <b>A <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rava:</b> A lost <b>object found by a wife</b> belongs <b>to her; Rabbi Akiva says</b> it belongs <b>to her husband.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> that <i>tanna</i>: This <i>baraita</i> is puzzling. <b>Now, if,</b> with regard to the <b>surplus</b> of the wife’s earnings beyond the minimum sum stipulated by the Sages,"
