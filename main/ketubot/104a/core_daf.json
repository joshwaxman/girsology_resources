    "<b>which is</b> situated at a <b>high</b> altitude <b>and</b> whose <b>air is scented.</b>",
    "§ It is related that <b>on the day that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>died, the Sages decreed a fast, and begged for</b> divine <b>mercy</b> so that he would not die. <b>And they said: Anyone who says that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>has died will be stabbed with a sword.</b>",
    "<b>The maidservant of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>ascended to the roof</b> and <b>said: The upper</b> realms <b>are requesting</b> the presence of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and the lower</b> realms <b>are requesting</b> the presence of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>May it be</b> the <b>will</b> of God <b>that the lower</b> worlds <b>should impose</b> their will <b>upon the upper</b> worlds. However, <b>when she saw how many times he would enter the bathroom and remove</b> his <b>phylacteries,</b> and then exit <b>and put them</b> back <b>on, and</b> how <b>he was suffering</b> with his intestinal disease, <b>she said: May it be</b> the <b>will</b> of God <b>that the upper</b> worlds <b>should impose</b> their will <b>upon the lower</b> worlds.",
    "<b>And the Sages,</b> meanwhile, <b>would not be silent,</b> i.e., they would not refrain, <b>from begging for mercy</b> so that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would not die. So <b>she took a jug [<i>kuza</i>]</b> and <b>threw it from the roof to the ground.</b> Due to the sudden noise, the Sages <b>were</b> momentarily <b>silent</b> and refrained <b>from</b> begging for <b>mercy, and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>died.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages said to bar Kappara: Go and ascertain</b> the condition of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. <b>He went</b> and <b>found that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>had died. He tore his clothing and reversed</b> them so that <b>the tear</b> would be <b>behind him</b> and not be noticed. When he returned to the Sages <b>he opened</b> his remarks <b>and said:</b> The <b>angels [<i>erelim</i>] and righteous</b> mortals [<i>metzukim</i>] both <b>clutched the sacred ark. The angels triumphed</b> over <b>the righteous, and the sacred ark was captured. They said to him:</b> Has <b>he died? He said to them: You have said it and I did not say it,</b> as it had been decided that no one should say that he died.",
    "It is further related: <b>At the time of the death of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>he raised his ten fingers toward Heaven</b> and <b>said</b> in prayer: <b>Master of the Universe, it is revealed and known before You that I toiled with my ten fingers in the Torah, and I have not derived any benefit</b> from the world <b>even with</b> my <b>small finger. May it be Your will that there be peace in my repose. A Divine Voice emerged and said: “He enters in peace, they rest in their beds”</b> (Isaiah 57:2).",
    "The Gemara asks: Why does it say: “They rest in their beds,” in the plural? <b>It should have</b> said: <b>In your bed,</b> in the singular, as the beginning of the verse is phrased in the singular. The Gemara notes: This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda. As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Shaul said: At the time when a righteous individual departs from the world, the ministering angels say before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, the righteous</b> individual <b>so-and-so is coming.</b> The Holy One, Blessed be He, then <b>says to them: The righteous should come</b> forth <b>and they should go out toward him. And</b> the righteous <b>say to</b> the newly deceased individual: <b>He enters in peace,</b> and subsequently, the righteous <b>rest in their beds.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Elazar said: At the time when a righteous individual departs from the world, three contingents of ministering angels go out toward him. One says to him: Enter in peace; and one says</b> to him: Each one <b>that walks in his uprightness; and one says to him: He enters in peace, they rest in their beds. At the time when a wicked person perishes from the world, three contingents of angels of destruction go out toward him. One says</b> to him: <b>“There is no peace, says the Lord concerning the wicked”</b> (Isaiah 48:22); <b>and one says to him: “You shall lie down in sorrow”</b> (Isaiah 50:11); <b>and one says to him: “Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised”</b> (Ezekiel 32:19).",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>As long as</b> a widow <b>is</b> living <b>in the house of her father</b> and is being supported by her husband’s heirs, <b>she may always collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract,</b> even after many years. <b>As long as she is</b> living <b>in the house of her husband, she may collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract until twenty-five years</b> later, at which point she may no longer collect the payment. This is <b>because there is</b> enough time <b>in twenty-five years for her to do favors</b> and give to others, thereby spending the resources of the orphans, until what she has spent <b>equals</b> the value of <b>her marriage contract.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir, who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>",
    "<b>And the Rabbis say</b> the opposite: <b>As long as she is</b> residing <b>in the house of her husband she may always collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract,</b> since during this time the heirs are caring for her and she is therefore embarrassed to sue them for payment of her marriage contract. However, <b>as long as she is in the house of her father she may collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract until twenty-five years</b> later, and if by then she has not sued for it, it is assumed that she has waived her rights to it.",
    "If <b>she died, her heirs mention her marriage contract</b> up <b>until twenty-five years</b> later.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna stated that according to Rabbi Meir, over a period of twenty-five years a woman will spend a sum equal to her marriage contract from the resources of the orphans. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef:</b> Is it true that <b>the poorest</b> woman <b>among the Jewish people,</b> whose marriage contract is of minimal value, will not spend this amount <b>until twenty-five years</b> have passed, <b>and Marta bat Baitos,</b> who was very wealthy and whose marriage contract was worth a huge sum, will also spend a sum equal to her marriage contract <b>within twenty-five years?</b>",
    "<b>He said to him: According to the camel is the load,</b> i.e., a wealthy woman, whose marriage contract is of greater value, will spend more money over a particular period of time than a poor woman, whose marriage contract is of lesser value.",
    "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to Rabbi Meir,</b> the amount of benefit she gains is determined by the years that have passed. If so, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>she divides</b> the value of her marriage contract in accordance with the number of years that have gone by, such that if some of the twenty-five years passed, she forfeits the proportionate value of her marriage contract? No answer was found for this dilemma, and the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
    "§ We learned in the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say: As long as</b> she is in her husband’s house she may collect payment of her marriage contract at any time, but while she is in her father’s house she may collect it only within twenty-five years. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef:</b> If <b>she came before the setting of the sun</b> at the end of the twenty-five-year period, <b>she collects</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract,</b> but if she came <b>after the setting of the sun she may not collect</b> it? <b>In that slight</b> period of time <b>did she waive</b> her rights to the payment of her marriage contract?",
    "<b>He said to him: Yes. All the measures of the Sages</b> that prescribe specific parameters or sizes <b>are such</b> that if one oversteps the fixed limits, he has not accomplished anything as far as the <i>halakha</i> is considered. Consequently, <b>in</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>one may immerse</b> and become ritually pure. However, <b>in</b> a ritual bath containing <b>forty <i>se’a</i> less</b> one <b><i>kortov</i>,</b> a small amount, <b>he is unable to immerse therein</b> and become ritually pure.",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, testified before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and <b>said in the name of his father,</b> Rabbi Yosei: <b>They taught</b> all of the above <b>only</b> in a case where <b>she does not have a marriage contract in her possession,</b> such as in a locale where the custom is not to write a marriage contract, <b>but</b> in a situation <b>where she does have a marriage contract in her possession, she may collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract forever. And Rabbi Elazar said: Even if she has a marriage contract in her possession, she</b> still <b>collects</b> payment of her marriage contract <b>only within twenty-five years</b> after the death of her husband.",
    "<b>Rav Sheshet raised an objection</b> against the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, based upon the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 12:3): <b>A creditor may collect</b> the money he is owed even after a long time has passed <b>without</b> his having <b>mentioned</b> the debt. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances? If he does not hold the document</b> that records the debt, <b>with what is he collecting</b> the debt? <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>he does hold the document.</b> It can be inferred that even so, it is specifically <b>a creditor, who</b> it could be assumed <b>is not one</b> to have <b>forgiven</b> his debt, who may continue to collect the debt after a long period of time. <b>But a widow</b> is presumed to have <b>waived</b> her rights to the payment of her marriage contract even if she has the marriage contract in her possession. This conclusion contradicts the statement of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei.",
    "The Gemara states that Rav Sheshet <b>raised the objection and he resolved it: Actually,</b> the case in the <i>Tosefta</i> is where the creditor <b>does not hold a document</b> that records the debt, <b>and</b> the reason he may collect the debt is because <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where the debtor admits</b> that he owes the creditor money. Consequently, it cannot be proven from this case that a widow who has a marriage contract in her possession is unable to collect its payment.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ela say:</b> The Sages <b>teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A divorcée is like a creditor</b> and may collect her marriage contract after a long period of time even if she has not made mention of it during the course of that time? The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances? If she does not hold a marriage contract</b> in her possession, <b>with what is she collecting</b> payment? <b>Rather, is it not</b> that <b>she holds a marriage contract</b> in her possession, <b>and it is a divorcée</b> who may collect under these circumstances, <b>as she is not one</b> who could be assumed to have <b>waived</b> the rights to the payment owed to her, as she does not maintain a relationship with the family that would prompt her to waive the rights to her claims? <b>But a widow</b> is likely to <b>waive</b> the rights to her claim, even though she is in possession of a contract.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> the case is one <b>where the debtor,</b> i.e., the husband, <b>admits</b> to owing the divorcée payment for her marriage contract, although she does not have the marriage contract in her possession.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Rav Yehuda bar Kaza teaches in a <i>baraita</i> of the school</b> of <b>bar Kaza:</b> If the widow <b>demanded</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract,</b>"
