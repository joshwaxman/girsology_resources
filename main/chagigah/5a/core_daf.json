    "<b>and sweeping the oven. She took</b> the fire <b>and set it on her foot; she was scalded and her luck suffered,</b> which gave me the opportunity, <b>and I brought her.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said to</b> the Angel of Death: Do <b>you have the right to act in this</b> manner, to take someone before his time? The Angel of Death <b>said to him: And</b> is it <b>not written: “But there are those swept away without justice”</b> (Proverbs 13:23)? Rav Beivai <b>said to him: And isn’t it written: “One generation passes away, and another generation comes”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:4), which indicates that there is a predetermined amount of time for the life of every generation.",
    "<b>He said</b> to him: <b>I shepherd them,</b> not releasing them <b>until</b> the years of <b>the generation are completed, and then I pass them on to</b> the angel <b>Duma</b> who oversees the souls of the dead. Rav Beivai <b>said to him: Ultimately, what do you do</b> with <b>his</b> extra <b>years,</b> those taken away from this individual? The Angel of Death <b>said</b> to him: <b>If there is a Torah scholar who disregards his</b> personal <b>matters,</b> i.e., who overlooks the insults of those who wrong him, <b>I add those</b> years <b>to him and he becomes</b> the deceased’s <b>replacement</b> for that time.",
    "§ The Gemara returns to the previous topic. <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried,</b> as God said to the Satan about Job: <b>“Although you did incite Me against him, to destroy him without cause”</b> (Job 2:3). Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With regard to <b>a slave whose master</b> is one whom others <b>incite</b> to act harshly against the slave <b>and</b> the master <b>is incited</b> to do so, <b>is there a remedy for</b> the slave? Additionally, <b>when Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “Behold He puts no trust in His sacred ones”</b> (Job 15:15), saying: <b>If He does not place trust in His sacred ones, in whom</b> does <b>He place trust?</b>",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>One day</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>was walking along the road,</b> and <b>he saw a certain man who was picking figs</b> in an unusual manner: <b>He left the ones that had reached</b> the stage of ripeness <b>and took those that had not</b> yet <b>reached</b> that state. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Aren’t these</b> ripe ones <b>much better? He said to him: I need these</b> figs <b>for the road; these</b> that are not yet ripe <b>will be preserved, and these</b> that are already ripe <b>will not be preserved.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said: This is</b> the same <b>as is written: “Behold He puts no trust in His sacred ones”;</b> there are righteous people whom God takes from this world before their time, as He knows that in the future they will stumble.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But there was a certain student in the neighborhood of Rabbi Alexandri, and he died while</b> he was still <b>young. And</b> Rabbi Alexandri <b>said: If this</b> young <b>Sage had wanted, he would have lived,</b> i.e., his actions caused him to die young. <b>And if it is so,</b> as Rabbi Yoḥanan suggested, <b>perhaps</b> this student was <b>from</b> those concerning whom it is written: <b>“Behold he puts no trust in his sacred ones,”</b> and it was not his sins that caused his death. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> student <b>was</b> one who acted <b>irreverently toward his teachers,</b> and Rabbi Alexandri knew of his improper behavior.",
    "<b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false witnesses, and against those who oppress the hireling in his wages,</b> the widow, and the fatherless, and who turn aside the convert from his right, and do not fear Me, says the Lord” (Malachi 3:5). He said: With regard to <b>a slave whose master comes near to him to judge him and is swift to testify</b> against <b>him,</b> is <b>there a remedy for him?</b>",
    "With regard to that same verse, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Woe to us, as the verse weighs lenient</b> mitzvot <b>for us like</b> more <b>stringent</b> mitzvot, as it lists both those who violate sins punishable by death, e.g., sorcerers and adulterers, with those who violate apparently less severe sins, e.g., those who withhold payment from a hired worker.",
    "<b>Reish Lakish said: Anyone who distorts the judgment of a convert, it is</b> considered <b>as if he distorted the judgment of</b> the One <b>above, as it is stated: “And who turn aside [<i>umattei</i>] the convert”</b> (Malachi 3:5). This term <b>is written</b> as: <b><i>Umatti</i>,</b> turn Me aside, i.e., one who distorts the judgment of a convert is considered as though he distorts the judgment of God, as it were. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Anyone who does something</b> sinful <b>and regrets it, he is forgiven immediately, as it is stated: “And do not fear Me”</b> (Malachi 3:5), which indicates that if <b>they</b> do <b>fear Me</b> and are embarrassed to sin before God, <b>they are forgiven immediately.</b>",
    "Additionally, <b>when Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “For God shall bring every work into the judgment concerning every hidden thing”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:14). He said: With regard to <b>a slave whose master weighs his unwitting</b> sins <b>like intentional</b> ones, i.e., God punishes him even for an action that was hidden from him, <b>is there a remedy for him?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> sin is the verse referring to when it states: <b>“Concerning every hidden thing”? Rav said: This</b> is referring to <b>one who kills a louse in the presence of another and</b> his friend <b>is disgusted by it.</b> God judges him for the unintentional discomfort he caused. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>Shmuel said: This</b> is referring to <b>one who spits in the presence of another</b> and his friend <b>is disgusted</b> by his action.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the end of that verse: <b>“Whether it be good, or whether it be evil”</b> (Ecclesiastes 12:14)? This verse indicates that God judges man harshly even for the good deeds he performs. The Sages <b>from the school of Rabbi Yannai say: This</b> verse is referring to <b>one who gives charity to a poor person in public.</b> Although he performed a good deed, he embarrassed the pauper, <b>as in this</b> case <b>of Rabbi Yannai,</b> who <b>saw a certain man who was giving a dinar to a poor person in public. He said to him:</b> It would have been <b>better had you not given</b> it <b>to him than</b> what you did, as <b>now you gave</b> it to <b>him and embarrassed him.</b>",
    "The Sages from <b>the school of Rabbi Sheila say: This</b> verse is referring to <b>one who gives charity to a woman in private, as he subjects her to suspicion,</b> for people might think that he is engaging her services as a prostitute. <b>Rava said: This</b> is referring to <b>one who sends his wife meat that is not sliced,</b> i.e., that has not yet had the prohibited sciatic nerve removed, <b>on Shabbat eve.</b> Since she is in a hurry she might not notice and will perhaps cook the prohibited meat.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> yet <b>Rava</b> himself would <b>send</b> this type of meat to his wife on Shabbat eve. The Gemara answers: <b>The daughter of Rav Ḥisda,</b> Rava’s wife, <b>is different, as he was certain about her that she was an expert</b> in this matter. Rava trusted that his wife would realize the sciatic nerve had not been removed even when she was in a hurry on Shabbat eve.",
    "Additionally, <b>when Rabbi Yoḥanan reached this verse, he cried: “Then it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are come upon them”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:21). He said: With regard to <b>a slave whose master brings upon him evils and troubles, is there a remedy for him?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the verse referring to when it states: <b>“Evils and troubles”? Rav said: Evils that become troubles for one another,</b> i.e., the remedy for one problem has a deleterious effect on the other. <b>For example,</b> one who is stung by a <b>hornet and a scorpion.</b> The sting of a hornet must be treated only with a cold ointment, while that of a scorpion must be treated with a hot ointment. As these medicaments are mutually exclusive, one cannot treat both stings at the same time.",
    "<b>And Shmuel said: This</b> verse is referring to <b>one who provides money to a poor person</b> as a loan <b>during his exigent</b> financial <b>circumstances,</b> but immediately after the borrower is released from the initial pressure by receiving the loan, the lender begins to demand repayment, subjecting the recipient to further pressure. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> explains the folk saying <b>that people say: A dinar for produce is not found; for hanging</b> it can be <b>found.</b> A poor person cannot find money to buy basic necessities; however, when the lenders hang on and pressure him he must come up with the money somehow.",
    "On the same topic the Gemara states: <b>“Then My anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them,</b> and they shall be devoured” (Deuteronomy 31:17). <b>Rav Bardela bar Tavyumei said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone who is not subject to</b> His <b>hiding of the face,</b> i.e., whose prayers are invariably answered, <b>is not from</b> the Jewish people, as the verse states about the Jewish people that God will hide His face from them as a result of their sins. Similarly, <b>anyone</b> who <b>is not subject to: “And they shall be devoured,”</b> i.e., gentiles do not steal his money,"
