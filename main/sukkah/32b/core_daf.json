    "<b>And others raise it as a contradiction. We learned in the mishna:</b> A <i>lulav</i> from the <b>palms of the Iron Mountain is fit. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is <b>unfit? Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the mishna, where the <i>lulav</i> is fit, it is referring to a case <b>where the top of this</b> leaf <b>reaches the base of that</b> next leaf, whereas, <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, where the <i>lulav</i> is unfit, it is referring to a case <b>where the top of this</b> leaf <b>does not reach the base of that</b> next leaf.",
    "The Gemara describes the location of these <i>lulavim</i>. <b>Rabbi Maryon said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, and some say that Rabba bar Mari taught</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: There are two date palms in the valley of ben Hinnom, and smoke arises from between them. And this is</b> the place about <b>which we learned</b> in the mishna: A <i>lulav</i> from the <b>palms of the Iron Mountain is fit. And that</b> site <b>is the entrance of Gehenna.</b>",
    "The mishna continues: <b>A <i>lulav</i> that has three handbreadths</b> in length, sufficient to enable one to wave with it, is fit for use in fulfilling the mitzva. <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The</b> minimum <b>measure of a myrtle branch and a willow branch is three</b> handbreadths. <b>And</b> the minimum measure of <b>a <i>lulav</i> is four</b> handbreadths. The difference between the measures is <b>so that the <i>lulav</i> will extend</b> at least one <b>handbreadth from the myrtle branch.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Parnakh</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The spine of the <i>lulav</i>,</b> and not merely its leaves, <b>must</b> be at least four handbreadths long, so that it will <b>extend from the myrtle branch</b> at least one <b>handbreadth.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: Didn’t <b>we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>A <i>lulav</i> that has three handbreadths</b> in length, <b>sufficient</b> to enable one <b>to wave with it,</b> is <b>fit</b> for use in fulfilling the mitzva? That indicates that a <i>lulav</i> three handbreadths long is fit. The Gemara answers: Emend the language of the mishna and <b>say:</b> A <i>lulav</i> that has three handbreadths <b>and</b> an additional handbreadth that is <b>sufficient</b> to enable one <b>to wave with it</b> is <b>fit.</b> This emendation is understood by each <i>amora</i> according to his opinion. It is understood by <b>this Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>as per his</b> opinion that only one additional handbreadth is required including the leaves; <b>and</b> it is understood by <b>this Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>as per his</b> opinion that the additional handbreadth must be in the length of the spine of the <i>lulav</i>, and the leaves are not taken into consideration.",
    "The Gemara cites proof from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: The</b> minimum <b>measure of a myrtle branch and of a willow branch is three</b> handbreadths, <b>and</b> that of <b>a <i>lulav</i> is four</b> handbreadths. <b>What, is it not</b> that this measure is calculated <b>with the leaves,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel? The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> it can be understood that the measure is calculated <b>without the leaves.</b>",
    "Apropos the <i>baraita</i> cited above, the Gemara discusses <b>the matter itself. The</b> minimum <b>measure of a myrtle branch and of a willow branch is three</b> handbreadths, <b>and</b> that of <b>a <i>lulav</i> is four</b> handbreadths. <b>Rabbi Tarfon says: With a cubit of five handbreadths.</b> The preliminary understanding of Rabbi Tarfon’s opinion is that the minimum measure of a myrtle branch is five handbreadths, not three.",
    "<b>Rava said: May his Master,</b> the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>forgive Rabbi Tarfon</b> for this extreme stringency. <b>Now, we do not find</b> even <b>a dense-leaved</b> myrtle branch <b>three</b> handbreadths long; is it <b>necessary</b> to say that finding one <b>five</b> handbreadths long is nearly impossible?",
    "<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that this is the correct understanding of the statement of Rabbi Tarfon: Take <b>a cubit of six handbreadths,</b> and <b>render it</b> a cubit of <b>five</b> handbreadths. Rabbi Tarfon is saying that for the purpose of measuring the myrtle branch, willow branch, and <i>lulav</i>, the standard six-handbreadth cubit is divided into five handbreadths, each slightly larger than the standard handbreadth. <b>Take three of</b> these large handbreadths <b>for the myrtle branch, and</b> three of these handbreadths plus <b>the extra</b> handbreadth <b>for the <i>lulav</i>.</b> The Gemara calculates: <b>How many</b> standard handbreadths <b>are there</b> in the minimum measure of a myrtle branch or willow branch? There are <b>three and three-fifths</b> standard handbreadths.",
    "However, on that basis, there is <b>a difficulty,</b> as one statement <b>of Shmuel</b> contradicts another statement <b>of Shmuel. Here, Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The minimum <b>measure of</b> the <b>myrtle branch and</b> of <b>the willow branch is three</b> handbreadths, <b>and there, Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon,</b> who requires a larger handbreadth. There is a discrepancy of three-fifths of a handbreadth between the measures. The Gemara answers: When Shmuel said that the measure is three handbreadths, he <b>was not precise</b> and merely approximated the measure. The Gemara asks: <b>Say that we say: He was not precise when</b> the approximation leads <b>to stringency,</b> but when it leads <b>to leniency, do we say: He was not precise?</b> That would result in using an unfit myrtle branch in performing a mitzva.",
    "<b>When Rabin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that this is the correct understanding of the statement of Rabbi Tarfon: Take <b>a cubit of five handbreadths,</b> and <b>render it</b> a cubit of <b>six</b> handbreadths. Rabbi Tarfon said that for the purpose of measuring the myrtle branch, willow branch, and <i>lulav</i>, a five-handbreadth cubit is divided into six handbreadths, each slightly smaller than the standard handbreadth. <b>Take three of</b> these smaller handbreadths <b>for the myrtle branch, and</b> three of these handbreadths plus <b>the extra</b> handbreadth <b>for the <i>lulav</i>.</b> The Gemara calculates: <b>How many</b> standard handbreadths <b>are there</b> in the minimum measure of a myrtle branch or willow branch? There are <b>two and a half</b> standard handbreadths.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately,</b> there remains <b>a difficulty,</b> as one statement <b>of Shmuel</b> contradicts another statement <b>of Shmuel.</b> In one statement he said the minimum measure of a myrtle branch is two and a half handbreadths, and in another he said that the measure is three handbreadths. The Gemara answers: When Shmuel said that the measure is three handbreadths, he <b>was not precise</b> and merely approximated the measure. <b>And this</b> is a case of: <b>He was not precise,</b> where the approximation leads <b>to a stringency, as Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon.</b> Shmuel holds that the actual measure required is two and a half handbreadths, and he rounded it off to three, which is a more stringent measure.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A myrtle branch that was stolen or that is</b> completely <b>dry is unfit. A myrtle branch of a tree worshipped as idolatry [<i>asheira</i>] or</b> a myrtle branch <b>from a city</b> whose residents were <b>incited</b> to idolatry <b>is unfit.</b> If <b>the top</b> of the myrtle branch <b>was severed,</b> if <b>the leaves were severed</b> completely, or if <b>its berries were more numerous than its leaves, it is unfit. If one diminished their</b> number by plucking berries so that they no longer outnumbered the leaves, the myrtle branch is <b>fit. But one may not diminish</b> the number <b>on the Festival</b> itself.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> It is written: <b>“Boughs of a dense-leaved tree”</b> (Leviticus 23:40); this is referring to <b>a tree whose leaves obscure its tree. And which tree is that? You must say it is the myrtle tree.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And say</b> it is <b>the olive</b> tree, whose leaves obscure the tree. The Gemara answers: <b>We require a “dense-leaved”</b> tree, whose leaves are in a chain-like configuration, <b>and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case with an olive tree.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>And say it is the Oriental plane tree,</b> whose leaves are in a braid-like configuration. The Gemara answers: <b>We require</b> a tree whose <b>leaves obscure its tree, and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case with <b>an Oriental plane tree.</b> ",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>And say</b> the verse is referring to <b>oleander,</b> which has both characteristics. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is written with regard to the Torah: <b>“Its ways are ways of pleasantness”</b> (Proverbs 3:17), <b>and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case with the oleander tree, because it is a poisonous plant and its sharp, thorn-like leaves pierce the hand of one holding it. <b>Rava said:</b> The unfitness of the oleander is derived <b>from here: “Love truth and peace”</b> (Zechariah 8:19), and poisonous plants that pierce are antithetical to peace.",
    "<b>The Sages taught: Plaited like a braid and chain-like; that is</b> characteristic of the <b>myrtle branch</b> used in the fulfillment of the mitzva. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> another characteristic. It is written: <b>“Boughs of a dense-leaved tree,”</b> indicating <b>a tree that the taste of its branches and</b> the taste of <b>its fruit are alike. You must say this is the myrtle branch.</b>",
    "<b>A Sage taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>A dense-leaved branch is fit, and one that is not dense-leaved is unfit,</b> even though it is a myrtle branch.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>“dense-leaved tree”? Rav Yehuda said: And</b> it <b>is</b> a configuration where <b>three leaves</b> emerge from <b>each base. Rav Kahana said: Even two</b> leaves emerging from one base <b>and one</b> leaf that covers the other two emerging from a lower base is called thick. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, would</b> purposely <b>seek</b> a myrtle branch configured with <b>two</b> leaves emerging from one base <b>and one</b> emerging from a lower base, <b>since</b> this statement <b>emerged from the mouth of Rav Kahana. Mar bar Ameimar said to Rav Ashi:</b> My <b>father called</b> a myrtle branch with that configuration <b>a wild myrtle branch.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>most of its leaves fell and only a minority</b> of the leaves <b>remained,</b> the myrtle branch is <b>fit, provided that its dense-leaved</b> nature remains <b>intact.</b>",
    "The Gemara wonders: <b>This matter itself is difficult,</b> as there is an internal contradiction in this <i>baraita</i>. On the one hand, <b>you said:</b> If <b>most of its leaves fell it is fit, and then</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: Provided that its dense-leaved</b> nature remains <b>intact. Once two</b> of every three leaves <b>fell, how can you find</b> a branch whose <b>dense-leaved</b> nature is intact?",
    "<b>Abaye said: You can find it</b>"
