    "<b>a</b> molded or protruding <b>cornice [<i>amaltera</i>]</b> crowning the entrance <b>should not be effective</b> in rendering an alleyway fit to carry within it if it is higher than twenty cubits, <b>as the Sanctuary had a cornice, and even so</b> it was <b>twenty cubits high,</b> and no more. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>Over it were five oak cornices, one</b> protruding <b>above the other.</b>",
    "The Gemara attempts to dismiss this difficulty: <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>that</b> mishna, <b>what is the refutation? Perhaps when that</b> mishna <b>with regard to cornices was taught, it was taught with regard to the Entrance Hall,</b> whose height was forty cubits, and not with regard to the Sanctuary.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>And what is the difficulty</b> with <b>that? Perhaps the design of the Sanctuary was like the design of the Entrance Hall.</b> Just as there were cornices in one doorway, there were cornices in the other.",
    "The Gemara returns to its question with regard to a cornice: <b>Why</b> then <b>did Rabbi Ile’a say</b> that <b>Rav</b> himself <b>said:</b> If the <b>width</b> of a cross beam is <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>even if it is not sturdy,</b> it renders the alleyway fit for carrying within it. <b>And if it has a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, one need not diminish</b> its height.",
    "<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>cornice</b> was not actually stated by Rav, but rather it <b>is a <i>baraita</i>. Who,</b> in fact, <b>teaches</b> that <i>baraita</i>? Perhaps it is not an authoritative <i>baraita</i>, and Rav does not have to accept what it says.",
    "<b>Abaye said: Isn’t it Ḥama, son of Rabba bar Avuh, who teaches it? And</b> therefore, even if the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <b>cornice will be a <i>baraita</i>, it</b> nevertheless <b>poses a difficulty to Rav.</b>",
    "<b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> Even if you <b>eliminate me</b> and my explanation <b>from</b> the discussion <b>here, don’t the</b> two <b><i>baraitot</i></b> themselves, the <i>baraita</i> that states that the Rabbis derive the dimensions of an entrance from the doorway of the Sanctuary and the <i>baraita</i> that states that in the case of a cornice, even if it is higher than twenty cubits, it need not be lowered, <b>contradict each other? Rather, what have you to say</b> to reconcile the contradiction? The matter is the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>; so too, according to my</b> opinion, it <b>is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Without Rav, the <i>baraitot</i> do not contradict each other,</b> as <b>according to the Rabbis, what is the reason</b> that <b>a</b> cross <b>beam</b> renders an alleyway fit for carrying? Because it serves <b>as a conspicuous marker</b> between the alleyway and the public domain. Ordinarily a cross beam more than twenty cubits high is not noticeable; however, a cornice attracts attention even at that height. <b>And that which is taught</b> in the other <i>baraita</i> with regard to the height of a beam at the entrance to an alleyway: <b>Greater than the entrance of the Sanctuary,</b> is <b>merely</b> a <b>mnemonic</b> device. No actual <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the entrance of the Sanctuary.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> that the explanation of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak works out well if he does not hold this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba; however, if he holds this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba,</b> it is difficult. As <b>Rabba said</b> with regard to the fitness of a <i>sukka</i> whose roofing is higher than twenty cubits that <b>it is written: “In order that your generations should know that I made</b> the children of Israel <b>dwell in booths</b> when I brought them out of the land of Egypt; I am the Lord your God” (Leviticus 23:43). When the roofing of a <i>sukka</i> is <b>up to twenty cubits</b> high, <b>a person is aware that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>;</b> however, when the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> is <b>above twenty cubits, a person is not aware</b> that he is dwelling in a <i>sukka</i>, <b>because the eye does not discern</b> the <i>sukka</i> roofing. One does not usually raise his head to look that high, and consequently, he sees the walls and does not notice the defining feature of the <i>sukka</i>, its roofing.",
    "The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Apparently, with regard to <i>sukka</i> as well,</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree</b> whether or not an item more than twenty cubits high is <b>conspicuous.</b> According to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, <b>why do I</b> need them to <b>disagree</b> about the same point <b>in two cases,</b> that of <i>sukka</i> and that of an alleyway? That the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda with regard to <i>sukka</i> revolves around this issue indicates that their dispute with regard to an alleyway revolves around a different point, as asserted by Rav.",
    "The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to teach both disputes, <b>as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to <i>sukka</i>,</b> one might have thought that only <b>in this</b> case does <b>Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that an object is conspicuous even above twenty cubits; <b>since</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>is designed for</b> extended <b>dwelling, the eye</b> undoubtedly <b>discerns</b> the roofing at some point. <b>However,</b> in the case of <b>an alleyway,</b> which <b>is designed for walking, say</b> that <b>he concedes to</b> the <b>Rabbis</b> that a person walking in an alleyway does not notice objects at so significant a height. <b>And had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case of an alleyway, one might have thought that only <b>in that</b> case do <b>the Rabbis say</b> that people do not notice objects at so significant a height; <b>however, in that</b> case of <i>sukka</i>, <b>say</b> that <b>they concede to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> for the above-stated reason. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both disputes.",
    "The Gemara seeks to arrive at a precise definition of <i>amaltera</i>, translated above as cornice. <b>What</b> is <b>an <i>amaltera</i>? Rav Ḥama, son of Rabba bar Avuh, said:</b> It refers to decorative wood carvings in the shape of <b>birds’ nests. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, it is referring to <b>cedar poles.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>The one who said</b> that <i>amaltera</i> refers to <b>cedar poles</b> would <b>all the more so</b> permit use of carvings of <b>birds’ nests,</b> as a cross beam engraved with images attracts attention and is noticeable even at a great height. However, <b>the one who said</b> that <i>amaltera</i> refers to carvings of <b>birds’ nests</b> would say that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a cornice applies only to them, <b>but not to cedar poles.</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies the opinion of <b>the one who said cedar poles. What is</b> the <b>reason</b> for his opinion? He holds that <b>since its length is great,</b> a cedar pole attracts attention. <b>But isn’t the length of a <i>sukka</i> great</b> as well, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Rabbis say that</b> a <i>sukka</i> higher than twenty cubits is <b>not</b> fit?",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the reason is as follows: <b>Since</b> a cedar pole <b>is</b> of <b>significant</b> value, <b>it</b> generates <b>publicity.</b> People passing through an alleyway stop and stare at a cross beam of that kind, even when it is higher than twenty cubits, leading others to do so as well.",
    "The Gemara raises a question: If <b>part of the</b> cross <b>beam</b> of an alleyway is <b>within twenty</b> cubits of the ground, <b>and part of the</b> cross <b>beam</b> is <b>above twenty</b> cubits, and similarly, if <b>part of the roofing</b> of a <i>sukka</i> is <b>within twenty</b> cubits, <b>and part of the roofing</b> is <b>above twenty</b> cubits, what is its legal status? <b>Rabba said: In</b> the case of <b>an alleyway, it is fit; in</b> the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, it is unfit.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different in</b> the case of <b>an alleyway</b> that the ruling is <b>that it is fit?</b> It is because <b>we say: Thin</b> the part of the cross beam that is beyond twenty cubits, i.e., consider it as if it were not there. If so, in the case of <b><i>sukka</i> too, say: Thin</b> the roofing that is beyond twenty cubits.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If you thin</b> the roofing beyond twenty cubits, <b>it will result in</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose sun is more than its shade.</b> Were the section of the roofing above twenty cubits removed, the roofing that remained would not provide sufficient shade for the <i>sukka</i>.",
    "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a cross beam, <b>if you thin</b> the section above twenty cubits, <b>it would become a</b> weak and unstable cross <b>beam that is removed by the wind,</b> which does not render the alleyway fit for carrying within it. <b>Rather, perforce,</b> the status of the remaining parts of those cross beams <b>becomes like</b> that of <b>metal skewers [<i>shefudin</i>],</b> which, although they are thin, are not removed by the wind. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a <i>sukka</i>, <b>perforce,</b> even after the upper roofing is removed, the status of the <i>sukka</i> <b>becomes like</b> that of a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose shade is more than its sun.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains Rabba’s distinction differently. <b>Rava from Parzakya said: A <i>sukka</i>, which is</b> generally erected <b>for an individual,</b> if the portion of the roofing below twenty were removed and only the portion above twenty remained, <b>he</b> would <b>not be reminded</b> to lower the remaining roofing and would dwell in a <i>sukka</i> that is unfit. <b>An alleyway,</b> in contrast, <b>which is</b> used by <b>many</b> people, if the section of the cross beam below twenty cubits were removed, <b>they</b> would <b>remind each other</b> to remedy the situation.",
    "<b>Ravina said</b> a different explanation: <b>With regard to a <i>sukka</i>,</b> since its mitzva <b>is by Torah law, the Sages were stringent.</b> However, <b>with regard to an alleyway,</b> since the entire requirement to place a cross beam across the entrance in order to permit carrying in an alleyway <b>is</b> only <b>by rabbinic law, the Sages were not stringent.</b>",
    "The Gemara cites a different version of Rabba’s distinction: <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana taught this <i>halakha</i> of Rabba</b> in the <b>opposite</b> manner. <b>Rabba said: In</b> the case of <b>an alleyway, it is unfit; in</b> the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, it is fit.</b> As a result, all the previous explanations must be reversed.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different in</b> the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i></b> that <b>it is fit?</b> Because <b>we say: Thin</b> the roofing that is beyond twenty cubits. If so, then <b>in</b> the case of <b>a</b> cross <b>beam as well, let us say: Thin</b> the part of the cross beam that is beyond twenty cubits.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If you thin</b> the part beyond twenty cubits, <b>it will become a</b> weak and unstable cross <b>beam that moves in the wind.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a <i>sukka</i>, <b>if you thin</b> the upper section of the roofing, <b>it would become</b> a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose sun is more than its shade. Rather, perforce,</b> even after the upper roofing is removed, the status of the <i>sukka</i> <b>becomes like</b> that of a <i>sukka</i> <b>whose shade is more than its sun; here too,</b> in the case of an alleyway, <b>perforce,</b> the status of the remaining parts of those cross beams <b>becomes like</b> that of <b>metal skewers,</b> which, although they are thin, do not move in the wind.",
    "The Gemara offers a different explanation of Rabba’s distinction: <b>Rava from Parzakya said:</b> In the case of <b>a <i>sukka</i>, which is</b> generally erected <b>for an individual, he casts</b> responsibility <b>upon himself and is reminded</b> to make certain that the roofing is fit. In the case of <b>an alleyway, which is</b> used by <b>many</b> people, <b>they</b> are likely to <b>rely upon each other and are not reminded</b> to check the height of the cross beam. <b>As people say: A pot</b> belonging to <b>partners is neither hot nor cold.</b> When responsibility falls upon more than one person, each relies on the other, and ultimately the task is not completed.",
    "<b>Ravina</b> offered a different explanation and <b>said:</b> The mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> which <b>is by Torah law, does not require reinforcement</b> by the Sages, and consequently, they were lenient in that case. However, since the entire requirement to place a cross beam across the entrance to <b>an alleyway is by rabbinic law,</b> it <b>requires reinforcement,</b> and therefore the Sages were stringent.",
    "Since there are two contradictory versions of Rabba’s statement, the Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> practical conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about this</b> problem, if part of the roofing of the <i>sukka</i> or the cross beam was above twenty cubits? <b>Rabba bar Rav Ulla said:</b> In that case, both <b>this,</b> an alleyway, <b>and that,</b> a <i>sukka</i>, <b>are unfit. Rava said:</b> Both <b>this and that are fit,</b>"
