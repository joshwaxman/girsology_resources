    "<b>And in</b> a time of <b>danger,</b> when it is dangerous to tarry outside town, <b>he covers</b> the phylacteries <b>and proceeds on his</b> way.",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that there is an alternative method of transferring the phylacteries: <b>One gives them to another</b> who is less than four cubits from him, <b>and the other</b> passes them <b>to another, until</b> the phylacteries <b>reach the outermost courtyard</b> of the city. Since carrying less than four cubits in a public domain is not prohibited by Torah law, in this case, the Sages permitted carrying in that manner due to the sanctity of the phylacteries.",
    "<b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one’s son</b> who was born in a field and may not be carried on Shabbat, since that is akin to carrying a burden in the public domain: <b>One gives him to another, and the other</b> passes him <b>to another, even</b> if it requires <b>a hundred</b> people. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person</b> may even <b>give a barrel to another, and the other</b> may pass it <b>to another,</b> and in that way <b>even</b> take it <b>beyond the</b> Shabbat <b>limit,</b> provided that no one person carries it more than four cubits. <b>They said to him: This</b> barrel may <b>not go a greater</b> distance <b>than the feet of its owner,</b> i.e., it may not be carried any farther than its owner may walk.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that a person who finds phylacteries in a field may carry them by pairs, indicating that <b>one pair, yes,</b> it may be carried; however, <b>more</b> than one pair, <b>no,</b> they may not be carried. The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>we learned the unattributed</b> mishna <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> despite the principle that an unattributed mishna usually reflects Rabbi Meir’s opinion.",
    "<b>As, if</b> you say that the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, didn’t</b> Rabbi Meir <b>say:</b> In order to rescue items from a fire, one is permitted to remove items from his house by wearing them, and <b>he dons all</b> the clothes <b>that he can wear, and wraps</b> himself <b>in all</b> items in <b>which he can wrap</b> himself. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>And one removes all the utensils to</b> the courtyard adjacent to the fire, <b>and dons all</b> the garments <b>that he can wear, and wraps</b> himself in <b>all</b> the items in <b>which he can wrap</b> himself in order to rescue his property.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> do we know that <b>this unattributed</b> mishna with regard to Shabbat <b>is</b> a reflection of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir? As it teaches with regard to</b> that mishna: If there are many garments there, one <b>dons</b> garments, and <b>takes</b> them <b>out</b> to a safe place, <b>and removes</b> them there, <b>and returns</b> to the fire, <b>and dons</b> other garments, <b>and takes</b> them <b>out and removes</b> them. <b>And</b> he may do so <b>even all day long;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Apparently, according to Rabbi Meir, one may don many garments at once.",
    "In answer to the question, <b>Rava said: Even if you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> there is a distinction between the cases. <b>There,</b> if he dons the clothes in <b>the manner that he</b> typically <b>wears them, the Sages rendered</b> the legal status of wearing garments on Shabbat <b>like</b> the status of wearing garments during the <b>week</b> and permitted him to remove clothes from his house by wearing them in that manner. <b>And here,</b> too, if he dons phylacteries in <b>the manner that he</b> typically <b>dons them, the Sages rendered</b> the legal status of donning phylacteries on Shabbat <b>like</b> the status of donning phylacteries during the <b>week.</b>",
    "Consequently, <b>there, where during the week he</b> may <b>wear as many</b> clothes <b>as he wishes, with regard to rescue</b> from a fire <b>the Sages likewise permitted him</b> to wear as many clothes as he wishes. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of phylacteries, <b>even during the week,</b> donning <b>one pair, yes,</b> one may do so, but donning <b>more</b> than one pair, <b>no,</b> he may not do so. Therefore, <b>with regard to rescue as well,</b> the Sages said: Donning <b>one pair, yes,</b> one may do so; however, donning <b>more</b> than one pair, <b>no,</b> he may not.",
    "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> He brings the phylacteries in <b>two</b> pairs <b>by two</b> pairs. The Gemara asks: <b>What does he hold?</b> What is the rationale for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If he holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is a time for phylacteries,</b> and one is permitted or even obligated to don phylacteries on Shabbat, then the ruling should be: Donning <b>one pair, yes,</b> this is permitted; donning <b>more, no,</b> it is prohibited. It should be prohibited to wear more than one pair as there is room to don only one set of phylacteries on one’s head.",
    "<b>And if he holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries, and</b> it was only <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>rescue</b> was permitted only in the <b>manner</b> that one typically wears <b>clothing</b> that <b>the Sages permitted him</b> to don phylacteries, he should <b>likewise</b> be permitted to don <b>even more</b> than two pairs. He should be permitted to don as many pairs of phylacteries as possible, not only two.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries, and when the Sages permitted</b> one to don phylacteries <b>for the purpose of rescue,</b> it was only by donning them in the <b>manner</b> that one typically wears <b>clothing,</b> i.e., in the appropriate <b>place</b> for <b>phylacteries.</b> He may not don them anywhere else on his body, as in that case he is considered to be carrying, not wearing them.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> then <b>one pair, yes,</b> it should be permitted, but <b>more, no,</b> it should not be permitted, as the second pair is necessarily positioned out of place. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: There is room on</b> one’s <b>head to place two phylacteries.</b> One can place two phylacteries on his head and don them both in the proper manner.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>It works out well</b> with regard to donning two phylacteries <b>of the head,</b> as there is room; however, with regard to the phylacteries <b>of the arm, what is there to say?</b> How can one wear two phylacteries on his arm simultaneously?",
    "The Gemara answers that even when one dons two phylacteries on his arm, he is regarded as donning them in the typical manner, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna. As Rav Huna said: Sometimes a person comes from the field with his bundle on his head,</b> and in order not to crush the phylacteries, he <b>removes them from his head and binds them on his arm.</b> This indicates that there is room for additional phylacteries on his arm.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>Say that Rav Huna said</b> that one may remove the phylacteries from his head and tie them on his arm <b>so that he will not</b> come to <b>treat</b> them <b>in a degrading manner</b> by placing a bundle on top of them. However, <b>did he say</b> that the spot on his arm is <b>fit</b> for two phylacteries? Can proof be cited from here that one may don additional phylacteries on his arm <i>ab initio</i>?",
    "<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: There is room on</b> one’s <b>head to place two phylacteries. Here, too, there is room on the arm to place two phylacteries.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>The school of Menashe taught</b> the following. The verse states: “And you shall bind them for a sign on your arm, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8). <b>“On your arm,” this is the biceps</b> muscle of the arm; <b>“between your eyes,” this is the crown</b> of the head. The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> exactly on the crown of the head? <b>The school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> Phylacteries are placed on <b>the spot where a baby’s head is soft</b> after birth.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say that</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna <b>disagree about</b> the principle of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak,</b> such <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> is not</b> of the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak</b> that there is room on one’s head for two phylacteries, <b>while Rabban Gamliel is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak,</b> and therefore one is permitted to bring in two pairs of phylacteries at a time.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone is</b> of the opinion of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether or not <b>Shabbat is a time for phylacteries. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is a time for phylacteries.</b> Although one may don one pair of phylacteries, he may not add to the mitzva by donning an extra pair. If he does so, it is tantamount to carrying a prohibited burden.",
    "<b>And Rabban Gamliel holds</b> that <b>Shabbat is not a time for phylacteries.</b> Consequently, one may don more than one pair, as the day itself is not at all suitable for donning phylacteries. When he dons the second pair, he is not adding to the mitzva. With regard to rescuing them, the phylacteries have the legal status of an ornament that he is permitted to don, provided that he dons no more than two pairs.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the dispute should be understood as follows. <b>Everyone agrees that Shabbat is a time for phylacteries, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether or not fulfillment of <b>mitzvot requires intent. The first <i>tanna</i> holds: To fulfill</b> a mitzva one <b>needs intent.</b> Therefore, if one dons phylacteries without intent to fulfill the mitzva, no mitzva is performed, and he is merely carrying a burden. However, if he has intent to fulfill the mitzva, he may don no more than one pair. If he does so, he violates the prohibition against adding to mitzvot.",
    "<b>And Rabban Gamliel holds:</b> In order to fulfill a mitzva, <b>one does not need intent.</b> Therefore, if one dons two pairs of phylacteries he fulfills his obligation with one of them, but does not violate the prohibition against adding to mitzvot with the other. In order to do so, he would require specific intent to fulfill a second mitzva with the additional pair."
