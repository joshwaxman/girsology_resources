    "<b>who, for</b> the Torah’s <b>sake, gets up early</b> in the morning [<i>shaḥar</i>] <b>and stays late</b> in the evening [<i>erev</i>] <b>in the study hall. Rabba said: In him who, for</b> the Torah’s <b>sake, blackens his face like a raven,</b> i.e., who fasts and deprives himself for the sake of Torah study.",
    "<b>Rava said: In him who makes himself cruel to his sons and</b> other <b>members of his household like a raven</b> for the sake of Torah. This <b>was the case with Rav Adda bar Mattana,</b> who <b>was</b> about to <b>go to the study hall</b> to learn Torah, and <b>his wife said to him: What shall I do for your children?</b> How shall I feed them in your absence? <b>He said to her: Are all the rushes [<i>kurmei</i>] in the marsh</b> already <b>gone?</b> If there is no other bread, let them eat food prepared from rushes.",
    "The Gemara proceeds to interpret a different verse homiletically: <b>“And He repays them that hate Him to His face to destroy them;</b> He will not be slack to him that hates Him, He will repay him to his face” (Deuteronomy 7:10). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Were the verse not written</b> in this manner, <b>it</b> would <b>be impossible to utter it,</b> in deference to God, for it could be understood, <b>as it were, like a person who bears a burden on his face, and wishes to throw it off.</b> Written slightly differently, the verse could have been understood as implying that God is unable, as it were, to bear the situation, but must punish the wicked immediately.",
    "With regard to the words <b>“He shall not be slack to him that hates Him,” Rabbi Ila said: He will not be slack</b> in bringing punishment <b>to him that hates Him, but He will be slack</b> in rewarding <b>those who are absolutely righteous,</b> as the reward of the righteous does not arrive immediately, but only in the World-to-Come.",
    "<b>And that</b> is <b>what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And you shall keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments <b>which I command you today to do them”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:11)? It means: <b>Today</b> is the time <b>to do them,</b> in this world, <b>and tomorrow</b> is <b>not</b> the time <b>to do them,</b> as there is no obligation or opportunity to fulfill mitzvot in the World-to-Come. Furthermore, it means: <b>Today</b> is the time <b>to do them,</b> but only <b>tomorrow,</b> in the ultimate future, is the time <b>to receive reward for</b> doing <b>them.</b>",
    "In a similar vein, <b>Rabbi Ḥaggai said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed: The Lord, the Lord, merciful and gracious, <b>long-suffering [<i>erekh appayim</i>],</b> and abundant in love and truth” (Exodus 34:6)? Why does it say “<i>erekh appayim</i>,” using a plural form? <b>It should have</b> said <b><i>erekh af</i>,</b> using the singular form.",
    "What this means is that God is long-suffering in two ways: He is <b>long-suffering toward the righteous,</b> i.e., He delays payment of their reward; and He is also <b>long-suffering toward the wicked,</b> i.e., He does not punish them immediately.",
    "The mishna stated that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The area may be expanded <b>up to</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> an area of five thousand square cubits. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages in clarification of this statement: <b>Did he speak</b> of the area of <b>the cistern</b> itself <b>and</b> that enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards,</b> that the total area enclosed by the upright boards may be expanded up to, but may not exceed, an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>? <b>Or perhaps he spoke</b> of the area of <b>the cistern without</b> that enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards,</b> that the cistern itself may be expanded up to an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>? In that case, the total area enclosed by the boards could exceed an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>.",
    "The underlying rationale of each side of this dilemma is as follows: Does one <b>fix his eyes on his cistern,</b> keeping in mind that the partition is made because of it, <b>and</b> therefore, since the area of the cistern is not greater than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>we do not decree lest he come to carry</b> also <b>in an enclosure [<i>karpef</i>],</b> an enclosed storage space behind the house that was not originally surrounded by a fence for the purpose of residence, even when it is <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>?</b>",
    "<b>Or perhaps a person fixes his eyes on his partition,</b> and does not pay attention to the cistern, but only to the area enclosed by the partition. <b>And</b> in this case <b>we</b> do <b>decree, lest he come to confuse</b> this case <b>with</b> that of <b>a <i>karpef</i></b> that is <b>larger than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>,</b> and come to carry there, because of the similarity between them.",
    "In order to resolve this question, the Gemara cites a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How close</b> may the boards be to the well? They may be <b>as</b> close as the length of <b>the head and most</b> of the body <b>of a cow. And how far may they be</b> from the well? The enclosed area may be expanded <b>even</b> to the area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i> and even two <i>beit kor</i>,</b> provided that one adds more upright boards or increases their size so as to reduce the size of the gaps between them. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Up to an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is permitted</b> to enclose the area in this manner; <b>more than</b> an area of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is prohibited.</b>",
    "The other Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Do you not concede with regard to a pen, a stable, a backyard, and a courtyard, that even one</b> the size <b>of five <i>beit kor</i> and</b> even <b>of ten <i>beit kor</i> is permitted</b> for use?",
    "Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> A distinction can be made between the cases, for <b>this,</b> the wall surrounding the pen, the stable or the yard, is a proper <b>partition,</b> and hence it is permitted to carry in them even if they are more than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>. However, <b>these are</b> only upright <b>boards,</b> and they only allow one to carry if the area they enclose is not more than an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>.",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: A cistern</b> the length of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> by</b> the width of <b>two <i>beit se’a</i> is permitted, and they only said to distance</b> the upright boards from the cistern <b>as</b> much as the length of <b>the head and most</b> of the body <b>of a cow.</b>",
    "The Gemara tries to draw an inference from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar spoke</b> only <b>of the cistern</b> itself <b>and not</b> of the upright <b>boards,</b> we can <b>infer</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda spoke of</b> both <b>the cistern</b> itself <b>and</b> the area enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards.</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: It is <b>not so.</b> When <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> said that the area may be expanded up to an area of two <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>he was,</b> in fact, <b>speaking of</b> the area of <b>the cistern without</b> that which is enclosed by <b>the</b> upright <b>boards.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, that is</b> exactly what <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> said. The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical halakhic difference <b>between them</b> in a case where the enclosed area is <b>long and narrow.</b> Rabbi Yehuda permits using it, whereas Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar requires that the area be square.",
    "The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated a principle:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> enclosed <b>space that is used as a dwelling, such as a pen, a stable, a backyard, or a courtyard,</b> even if it lacks a roof and <b>even</b> if the structure has the area of <b>five <i>beit kor</i> and</b> even <b>ten <i>beit kor</i>, it is permitted</b> to carry in it.",
    "<b>And</b> with regard to <b>any dwelling that is used for the space</b> outside it, i.e., whose partitions were arranged not so that it could be lived in, but for the sake of the field or yard outside, <b>such as field huts,</b> if its area was <b>two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is permitted</b> to carry in it; but if its area was <b>more than two <i>beit se’a</i>, it is prohibited</b> to do so.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If the path of the public domain passes through</b> the area of the upright boards surrounding a well <b>and obstructs it, one must divert</b> the path <b>to the sides,</b> so that the public will circumvent the enclosed area; otherwise, the partition is invalid and the enclosed area cannot be regarded as a private domain. <b>And the Rabbis say: One need not</b> divert the path of the public domain, for the partition is valid even if many people pass through it.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both said: Here,</b> the Rabbis <b>informed you of the strength of partitions;</b> although a path of the public domain passes through the partitions and the partitions do not constitute effective barriers, they are still strong enough to allow one to carry.",
    "The Gemara wishes to clarify the meaning of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: Did he mean <b>here</b> that the Rabbis expressed this idea, <b>and he agrees</b> with them that a public thoroughfare does not invalidate a partition? <b>Didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>Jerusalem,</b> even though it is walled, <b>were it not for the fact that its doors are locked at night, one would be liable for</b> carrying in <b>it</b> on Shabbat <b>because</b> its thoroughfares are regarded <b>as the public domain?</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that a partition is not strong enough to overcome the passage of many people.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement must be understood as follows: <b>Here,</b> the Rabbis expressed this idea, although <b>he does not agree</b> with them.",
    "The Gemara <b>raised a contradiction between</b> this statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> and another statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and raised a contradiction</b> between this statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> and another statement of <b>the Rabbis.</b>",
    "The other statements are <b>as it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Furthermore, Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> If <b>one had two houses on the two sides of the public domain,</b> and he wishes to carry from one house to the other on Shabbat via the public domain, <b>he may place a side post from here,</b> perpendicular to the public domain, <b>and</b> an additional <b>side post from here,</b> on the other side of the public domain, <b>or</b> he may place a cross <b>beam from here,</b> from one end of one house to the end of the house opposite it, <b>and</b> another cross <b>beam from here,</b> from the other side of the house, <b>and carry</b> objects <b>and place</b> them <b>in</b> the area <b>between them</b> because the two added partitions turn the area in the middle into a private domain. The Rabbis <b>said to him: One cannot make the public domain fit</b> for carrying <b>by</b> means of <b>an <i>eiruv</i> in this manner,</b> i.e., by means of a side post alone, when many people continue to walk through the public thoroughfare in the middle.",
    "Consequently, there is <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and there is also <b>a contradiction between</b> one statement of <b>the Rabbis and</b> the other statement of <b>the Rabbis.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: Between one statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and</b> the other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> there is <b>no contradiction,</b> because one can differentiate between them. <b>There,</b> in the case of the two houses, <b>there are two proper partitions,</b> for the houses are real partitions, and two partitions suffice to establish a separate domain. However, <b>here,</b> in the case of the upright boards, <b>there are not two proper partitions,</b> for the upright boards are not real partitions.",
    "Between one statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> and the other statement of <b>the Rabbis</b> there is <b>also no contradiction,</b> as <b>here,</b> with regard to the upright boards, <b>there is a nominal</b> set <b>of four partitions;</b> on all four sides side there are at least two cubits of some form of partition, so the cistern is regarded as enclosed by four partitions. However, <b>there,</b> with regard to the two houses, <b>there is not a nominal</b> set <b>of four partitions.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In <b>Eretz Yisrael one is not liable for</b> carrying in <b>the public domain. Rav Dimi sat and recited this <i>halakha</i>. Abaye said to Rav Dimi: What is the reason</b> underlying this ruling?"
