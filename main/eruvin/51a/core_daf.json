    "<b>Rava said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>only</b> in a case <b>where, were he to run to the trunk</b> of the tree <b>he could reach it</b> before the onset of Shabbat. <b>Abaye said to him: But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>state: And it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling, indicating that he is farther away than that?",
    "The Gemara answers: The mishna means that <b>it grew dark</b> while he was traveling so that he can no longer return <b>to his house</b> before nightfall; <b>however, he is able</b> to <b>go to the trunk</b> of the tree before Shabbat. <b>Some state</b> a different version of the previous statement. <b>Rava said:</b> The mishna means that <b>it grew dark</b> while <b>he</b> was traveling, so that <b>were he to walk very slowly</b> he could not reach his house; <b>however, if he runs, he can</b> still <b>arrive</b> before Shabbat.",
    "<b>Rabba and Rav Yosef were going</b> together <b>along the way. Rabba said to Rav Yosef: Our residence will be beneath the palm that carries its brother,</b> the one with another palm tree leaning on it. <b>And some say</b> he said to him: Our residence will be <b>beneath the palm that spared its owner from the land tax [<i>karga</i>],</b> the palm which yielded enough dates for its owner to pay his entire land tax.",
    "Rabba asked: <b>Does the Master know</b> of that tree? Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> No, <b>I do not know</b> of it. <b>He said to him:</b> Then <b>rely on me, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If two</b> people <b>were</b> walking together, <b>one</b> of whom is <b>familiar</b> with a particular location in the distance, <b>and one</b> is <b>not familiar</b> with it, <b>the one who</b> is <b>not familiar</b> with it <b>entrusts</b> his right to designate <b>his</b> residence <b>to the one who</b> is <b>familiar</b> with it, <b>and the one who</b> is <b>familiar</b> with it <b>says: My residence is in such-and-such place.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>But it is not</b> so; that is not the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Rabba <b>only taught it</b> as if it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei so that</b> Rav Yosef <b>would accept it from him, due to</b> the fact that <b>Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning</b> accompanies <b>his</b> rulings, Since the <i>halakha</i> is usually in accordance with Rav Yosei’s opinion, Rav Yosef would be less likely to raise doubts with regard to the ruling.",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>If one is not familiar</b> with a tree or any other noticeable landmark, <b>or if he is not an expert</b> in the <i>halakha</i>, unaware that residence can be established from a distance, and he said: My residence is at my current location, his presence at his current location acquires for him the right to walk two thousand cubits in each direction.",
    "The Gemara raises a fundamental question: <b>These two thousand cubits, where are</b> they <b>written</b> in the Torah? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Remain every man in his place”</b> (Exodus 16:29); <b>these are</b> the <b>four cubits,</b> which constitute the minimum Shabbat limit, e.g., for one who ventured beyond his prescribed limit. <b>“Let no man go out of his place”</b> (Exodus 16:29); <b>these are</b> the <b>two thousand cubits</b> of the Shabbat limit for one who remains in his place. Unless otherwise specified, the measure of one’s place is two thousand cubits.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is the measure of one’s place? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: We derive</b> this by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>place</b> written here: “Let no man go out of his place,” and <b>from</b> the term <b>place</b> written with regard to an unwitting murderer: “Then I will appoint you a place to where he shall flee” (Exodus 21:13). This last verse mentions both place and fleeing, <b>and</b> the term <b>place</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>fleeing. And</b> the term <b>fleeing</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>fleeing,</b> written in a different verse with regard to the unwitting murderer: “But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge, whither he has fled” (Numbers 35:26). <b>And</b> the term <b>fleeing</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>border,</b> which appears in the same verse. <b>And</b> the term <b>border</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>border,</b> as it states there: “And the avenger of blood find him outside [<i>miḥutz</i>] the borders of the city of his refuge” (Numbers 35:27). Since this verse mentions both the term border and the term outside, the term <b>border</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>outside. And</b> the term <b>outside</b> is derived <b>from</b> the term <b>outside, as it is written</b> with regard to the Levite cities, which also served as cities of refuge: <b>“And you shall measure from outside [<i>miḥutz</i>] the city on the east side two thousand cubits,</b> and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits” (Numbers 35:5). From this chain of identical terms, the meaning of the term place stated in connection with Shabbat is derived from the two thousand cubits mentioned with regard to the Levite cities.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But let us derive</b> instead by means of a verbal analogy between the term outside in the verse: “Outside the borders of the city of refuge,” and the term outside in the verse: <b>“From the wall of the city outward [<i>vaḥutza</i>] a thousand cubits”</b> (Numbers 35:4), that the Shabbat limit measures only a thousand cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>One derives</b> the meaning of the term <b>outside [<i>ḥutz</i>]</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> another instance of the term <b>outside [<i>ḥutz</i>], but one does not derive</b> the meaning of the term <b>outside from</b> the term <b>outward [<i>ḥutza</i>].</b>",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What is</b> significant about <b>the difference</b> between the two terms? <b>Didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses between the verse: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that <b>this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>returning,</b> i.e., it is after seven days; <b>this is</b> the same <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>coming;</b> it is after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference of one letter between <i>ḥutz</i> and <i>ḥutza</i>, should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy.",
    "Gemara rejects this argument: <b>This applies</b> only <b>when there are no terms</b> that are <b>identical to it however, where there are terms</b> that are <b>identical to it, we derive</b> the verbal analogy <b>from</b> terms <b>identical to it,</b> rather than from the terms that are not precisely identical.",
    "The <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna disagree whether the <b>two-thousand-cubit</b> limit granted to a person in every direction is measured as a <b>circle</b> or as a square tablet. The Gemara poses a question: With regard to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigenos</b> that the limit is measured as a circle, <b>no matter what</b> you say, it is difficult. <b>If he is of the</b> opinion that there is a <b>verbal analogy</b> from the verse written with regard to the Levite cities it is difficult, because <b>sides</b> is the term <b>written,</b> indicating squared boundaries. And <b>if he is not of the</b> opinion that there is a <b>verbal analogy, from where does he</b> derive that the Shabbat limit is <b>two thousand cubits?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he is of</b> the opinion that there is <b>a verbal analogy, but here,</b> with regard to the Levite cities, it <b>is different, as the verse says: “This shall be to them the open space of the cities”</b> (Numbers 35:5), from which it is inferred: <b>To this,</b> the open space of the city, <b>you</b> should <b>provide sides</b> and square it, <b>but you do not provide sides to those resting on Shabbat.</b> Instead, those who establish Shabbat residence are provided with a circular, two-thousand-cubit limit.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> understand the emphasis placed on the word this in the verse? The Gemara answers: As <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rav Ḥananya says: Like this</b> measure <b>shall be</b> the calculations of measures for <b>all those who rest on Shabbat,</b> i.e., square.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: One who carries</b> an object <b>four cubits in the public domain is only liable if he carries</b> it <b>four</b> cubits <b>with their diagonal.</b> The four cubits mentioned in many places is only the basic measure by which the distance beyond which it is prohibited to carry is calculated. However, in practice, a person is liable only if he carries the object the length of the diagonal of a square with four-cubit sides.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>Rava</b> once <b>tested us</b> by asking: With regard to <b>a pillar in the public domain, ten</b> handbreadths <b>high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide, must</b> the width <b>be</b> four handbreadths <b>with their diagonal</b> in order to be regarded a private domain, <b>or not? And we said to him: Is this not</b> that which was taught by <b>Rav Ḥananya? As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rav Ḥananya says: Like this</b> measure <b>shall be</b> that of <b>all those who rest on Shabbat,</b> indicating that the diagonal is the determining measure for the <i>halakhot</i> of rest on Shabbat.",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said: A pauper can establish an <i>eiruv</i> with his feet,</b> i.e., one who does not have the bread required to establish an <i>eiruv</i> may walk anywhere within his Shabbat limit and acquire residence. <b>We have</b> this leniency in effect <b>only</b> for <b>a pauper,</b> who does not have food for two meals. However, one who has bread may only establish residence with bread. Rabbi Yehuda says: This leniency is in effect for both a pauper and a wealthy person.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is <b>with regard to</b> a case where the person said: My residence is in <b>my</b> current <b>location. As Rabbi Meir maintains: The primary</b> ordinance and establishment <b>of <i>eiruv</i></b> is <b>with bread.</b>"
