    "<b>I can</b> make an argument that <b>exempts the entire world from judgment, from the day that the Temple was destroyed until now. As it is stated: “Therefore, hear now this, you afflicted and drunken, but not from wine”</b> (Isaiah 51:21), which teaches that in the wake of the destruction of the Temple, all Jews are considered intoxicated and are not responsible for any sins they commit.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this argument from the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who is <b>intoxicated, his acquisition is a</b> binding <b>acquisition;</b> that is, he cannot retract the transaction when he is sober, <b>and</b> similarly, <b>his sale is a</b> binding <b>sale.</b> Moreover, <b>if he committed a transgression for which</b> he is liable to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>he is executed;</b> and if the offense is punishable by <b>lashes, he is flogged. The principle is</b> that <b>he is like a sober person in all matters, except that he is exempt from prayer.</b> Therefore, even if the people of Israel are considered drunk, they are nonetheless responsible for their actions.",
    "The Gemara answers that even Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya did not mean that they should be exempt from liability for all their sins. Rather, <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>his statement: I can exempt?</b> He, <b>too,</b> meant that he could exempt them <b>from the judgment of prayer,</b> i.e., Jews cannot be held liable for praying without the proper intentions.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: They taught</b> that an intoxicated person is responsible for all his actions <b>only</b> in a case where <b>he did not reach the</b> state of <b>intoxication of Lot; however, if he reached the</b> state of <b>intoxication of Lot,</b> so that he is altogether unaware of his actions, <b>he is exempt from all</b> liability.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever passes a shield</b> over himself <b>at a time of arrogance,</b> i.e., whoever suppresses his evil inclination as though it were covered with a shield when he is arrogant, e.g., when he is intoxicated or the like (Rabbeinu Ḥananel), <b>troubles will be closed and sealed from him, as it is stated: “The channels of [<i>afikei</i>] his scales are his pride, closed together as with a tight [<i>tzar</i>] seal”</b> (Job 41:7). The verse is interpreted homiletically: When at a time of arrogance a person passes a shield [<i>mapik</i>] over his evil inclination, his troubles [<i>tzarot</i>] will be closed and sealed before him.",
    "The Gemara poses a question: <b>From where may it be inferred that</b> the meaning of <b>this</b> word <b><i>afik</i> is a formulation</b> denoting <b>passing [<i>aborei</i>]?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a wadi, like the channel [<i>afik</i>] of brooks that pass by [<i>ya’avoru</i>]”</b> (Job 6:15). This implies that the term <i>afik</i> is synonymous with the verb <i>ya’avoru</i>, which refers to something that travels and passes by.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is not the correct interpretation; rather, <b>it was stated</b> that <b>whoever does not</b> cover, but <b>draws out [<i>mapik</i>]</b> a shield at a time of arrogance, troubles will be closed and sealed from him. In other words, a person must draw his weapons and shield in order to fight his evil inclination when it tries to overpower him (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).",
    "The Gemara poses a question: <b>From where may it be inferred that this</b> word <b><i>mapik</i> is a formulation</b> denoting <b>revealing?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written: “The channels of [<i>afikei</i>] waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were laid bare”</b> (Psalms 18:16).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Now, since the verses may be interpreted both in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of</b> this <b>Master and in accordance with</b> the opinion of the other <b>Master, what is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The</b> practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to the following practice of <b>Rav Sheshet, as Rav Sheshet gave</b> the responsibility for monitoring <b>his sleep to his attendant,</b> instructing the attendant to wake him when the time for prayer arrived. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the practice of <b>Rav Sheshet</b> is correct, as Rabbi Ḥanina maintains that if one is in great need of sleep, it is better to nap for a while and then wake up with renewed vigor. <b>And one Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the practice of <b>Rav Sheshet</b> is correct. He holds that a person must marshal his strength and pray, rather than succumb to the need for sleep.",
    "<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone whose mind is unsettled should not pray, as it is stated: When distressed, one should not issue decisions.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, on a day that he was angry,</b> would <b>not pray,</b> as <b>he said that it is written: When distressed, one should not issue decisions.</b> The Gemara similarly relates that <b>Mar Ukva, on a day of a south wind, would not venture out to the court,</b> for this hot and harsh wind would disturb his usual clarity of mind.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The study of <b><i>halakha</i> requires clarity, as</b> on <b>a day</b> when <b>a north wind</b> blows and clears the skies. <b>Abaye said</b> similarly that <b>if my stepmother says to me: Bring</b> me a dish of <b><i>kutaḥ</i>, I can no</b> longer <b>study</b> Torah in my usual fashion, as even a simple task such as this troubles me and distracts me from my Torah study.",
    "Similarly, <b>Rava said: If I am bitten by a louse, I can no</b> longer <b>learn</b> in my usual manner. The Gemara relates that <b>the mother of Mar, son of Ravina, would prepare seven garments for him for the seven days</b> of the week, so that he would not be bitten by the lice found in old clothes (Rabbeinu Ḥananel).",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda said: Night was created only for sleep. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: The moon was created only for</b> Torah <b>study</b> by its light. When people <b>said to Rabbi Zeira: Your teachings are</b> exceedingly <b>sharp, he said to them: They were</b> formulated <b>during the daytime</b> hours. This teaches that Torah study during the day is most beneficial to clarity of the mind.",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda’s daughter said to</b> her father, <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who would spend his nights in study: <b>Doesn’t the Master wish to sleep a little?</b> He <b>said to her: Days that are long</b> in quantity <b>but short</b> in the opportunity to study Torah and perform mitzvot <b>will soon arrive, and we will sleep a lot.</b> After I die, there will be more than enough time for sleep.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We,</b> Torah scholars, <b>are day workers,</b> as our study is performed primarily during the day. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> would <b>borrow and repay,</b> i.e., if for some reason he neglected to study during the day, he would use the night hours to compensate for the missed time.",
    "<b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who returns</b> home <b>from a journey should not pray for three days</b> while recovering from the hardship of being on the road, <b>as it is stated: “And I gathered them together at the river that runs to Aḥava, and we encamped there for three days, and I inspected the people”</b> (Ezra 8:15), after which it is stated: “Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Aḥava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of Him a safe journey for us” (Ezra 8:21), which teaches that they rested three days before praying.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Shmuel’s father, when he would return</b> home <b>from his journey, would not pray</b> for <b>three days,</b> as he would have to rest from his journey. <b>Shmuel</b> himself <b>would not pray in a house that contained an alcoholic beverage,</b> as the scent of the alcohol would disturb his concentration during prayer. Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa would not pray in a house that contained small</b> fried <b>fish,</b> due to their smell.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Whoever is appeased by his wine,</b> i.e., whoever becomes more relaxed after drinking, <b>has in him</b> an element of <b>the mind-set of his Creator,</b> who acted in a similar fashion, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord smelled the sweet savor,</b> and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man’s sake” (Genesis 8:21). As it were, God acted more favorably toward His creatures after He was appeased with the smell of the burnt offerings. Smell can be as potent as drinking or eating itself.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Anyone who remains settled</b> of mind <b>after</b> drinking <b>wine,</b> and does not become intoxicated, <b>has</b> an element of <b>the mind-set of seventy Elders.</b> The allusion is: <b>Wine [<i>yayin</i></b> spelled <i>yod</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>] <b>was given in seventy letters,</b> as the numerological value of the letters comprising the word is seventy, as <i>yod</i> equals ten and <i>nun</i> equals fifty. Similarly, the word <b>secret [<i>sod</i></b> spelled <i>samekh</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>dalet</i>] <b>was given in seventy letters,</b> as <i>samekh</i> equals sixty, <i>vav</i> equals six, and <i>dalet</i> equals four. Typically, when <b>wine entered</b> the body, <b>a secret emerged.</b> Whoever does not reveal secrets when he drinks is clearly blessed with a firm mind, like that of seventy Elders.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥanin said: Wine was created only in order to comfort mourners</b> in their distress, <b>and to reward the wicked</b> in this world so they will have no reward left in the World-to-Come, <b>as it is stated: “Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish,</b> and wine to the bitter of soul. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more” (Proverbs 31:6). “Him that is ready to perish” refers to the wicked, who will perish from the world, while “the bitter of soul” denotes mourners.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥanin bar Pappa said: Anyone in whose house wine does not flow like water is not</b> yet <b>included</b> in the Torah’s <b>blessing, as it is stated: “And He shall bless your bread and your water”</b> (Exodus 23:25). The water mentioned in this verse actually refers to wine, as learned in the following manner: <b>Just as bread</b> is something <b>that may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> i.e., one is permitted to buy bread with money used to redeem second-tithe, <b>so</b> too the word <b>water</b> in the verse is referring to a liquid <b>that may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money. And what is that?</b> It is <b>wine,</b> as one may buy wine with second-tithe money, but one may not buy water; <b>and</b> nevertheless, the verse <b>calls it “water.”</b>"
