    "<b>And</b> the law is <b>likewise in a winepress</b> with respect to tithes. As long as one’s head and most of his body is in the winepress, he may drink from the wine without first separating tithes because drinking wine in a winepress is considered incidental drinking, which does not require tithing. The activity of harvesting and ingathering grapes is not considered completed as long as the grapes are in the winepress, since the grapes are still intended for making wine. Consequently, at this stage one may consume the produce in a casual, incidental manner. Once the work has been completed, however, one must tithe the produce before consuming any of it.",
    "The Gemara clarifies several laws related to this issue: <b>With regard to a person, it was said</b> in connection to these laws <b>that it is necessary</b> that <b>his head and most of his</b> body be inside the domain from which he is drinking. However, a question may be raised <b>with regard to a cow</b> standing in a public domain and drinking from a private domain, or vice versa: <b>Is it necessary</b> that <b>its head and most of its</b> body be inside the domain from which it is drinking, <b>or not?</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies: <b>Wherever</b> one <b>holds the bucket</b> from which the cow is drinking <b>but does not hold</b> the animal, there <b>should not be a dilemma for you,</b> for <b>it is</b> certainly <b>necessary</b> for <b>its head and most of its</b> body to be <b>inside,</b> as the cow might move backward and pull the bucket with it, causing him to carry it from one domain to the other. <b>Where there should be a dilemma for you</b> is <b>where he holds the bucket and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal. <b>What</b> is the law in such a case?",
    "<b>He said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> a resolution to this dilemma, for we have learned in the mishna: It is permitted to bring the upright boards closer to the well, <b>provided that</b> the enclosed area is large enough for <b>a cow</b> to stand in, with <b>its head and most of its</b> body <b>inside</b> the partitioned space <b>and drink. Does this not</b> refer even to a case <b>where</b> one <b>holds</b> the cow <b>and</b> also <b>holds the bucket?</b> The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this may refer exclusively to the case <b>where he holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And where he holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal, <b>is it permitted</b> to give his animal to drink in such a fashion? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not fill</b> a bucket with <b>water and hold</b> it <b>before his animal on Shabbat; but he may fill</b> it <b>and pour</b> it <b>out</b> into a trough, <b>and it,</b> i.e., the animal, <b>drinks of its own accord?</b> Consequently, we see that it is prohibited to give an animal to drink from a bucket if he does not hold the animal.",
    "The Gemara refutes this: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abaye said: Here</b> we are dealing with a cow standing inside a house with windows open to the public domain, eating from <b>a manger</b> or trough <b>that stands in the public domain</b> that is <b>ten handbreadths high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <b>and one end</b> of this manger <b>interposes into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a well?",
    "In such a case, it is prohibited to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the upright boards and hold it before his animal, unless the animal is within the enclosed area. This is a rabbinical <b>decree, lest one see that the manger was damaged</b> on the side in the public domain <b>and go to fix it, and he might take the bucket with him,</b> thereby <b>carrying</b> it <b>from the private domain to the public domain.</b> Rather, he must pour out the water into the manger, so that it reaches the animal on its own.",
    "The Gemara asks: Even if he carried the bucket into the public domain, <b>would he be liable in such a case? Didn’t Rav Safra say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>one who transfers objects from corner to corner</b> in a house, <b>and changed his mind about them</b> while carrying them <b>and carried them out</b> to the public domain, <b>he is exempt because the lifting at the first moment was not for that</b> purpose of carrying out to a different domain; when he picked them up, he intended merely to move them around his house. Here too, then, one should not be liable, since when he picked up the bucket he did not intend from the outset to carry it into the public domain; accordingly, there is no room for such a decree.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> say that the decree is due to a different concern, that <b>at times one would fix</b> the manger <b>and</b> then <b>bring</b> the bucket <b>back in again,</b> thereby <b>carrying from the public domain into the private domain.</b> In this case one picks up the bucket from the outset with the intention of carrying it from a public domain into a private domain.",
    "<b>Some say</b> a different version of the previous discussion. <b>With regard to a person, we said that it is sufficient</b> if <b>his head and most of his</b> body are inside the domain from which he is drinking. But a question may be raised <b>with regard to a cow</b> standing in a public domain and drinking from a private domain, or vice versa: <b>Is it sufficient</b> if <b>its head and most of its</b> body are inside the domain from which it is drinking, <b>or not?</b> Perhaps all of the cow must be in that domain.",
    "The Gemara clarifies the question. The case <b>where</b> one <b>holds the bucket</b> from which the cow is drinking <b>and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal <b>should not be a dilemma for you,</b> as <b>it is</b> certainly <b>enough</b> if <b>its head and most of its</b> body are in the domain. <b>Rather,</b> the case <b>where there should be a dilemma for you</b> is <b>where he holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such a case?",
    "<b>He said to him: We</b> already <b>learned</b> a resolution to this dilemma in the mishna: It is permitted to bring the upright boards closer to the well, <b>provided that</b> the enclosed area is large enough for <b>a cow</b> to stand in, with <b>its head and most of its</b> body <b>inside</b> the partitioned space, <b>and drink. Doesn’t this</b> refer even to a case <b>where</b> one <b>holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal? The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> this may refer only to the case <b>where he holds the bucket and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to say this, <b>for if one holds the bucket but does not hold</b> the animal, <b>is it</b> in fact <b>permitted</b> to give his animal to drink in such a fashion? <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not fill</b> a bucket with <b>water and hold</b> it <b>before his animal</b> on Shabbat. <b>But he may fill</b> it <b>and pour</b> it <b>out</b> into a trough, <b>and</b> the animal <b>drinks of its own accord.</b>",
    "The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Abaye said: Here,</b> we are dealing with <b>a manger that stands in the public domain,</b> and it is <b>ten handbreadths high and four</b> handbreadths <b>wide,</b> i.e., it constitutes a private domain, <b>and one end</b> of the manger <b>interposes into</b> the area <b>between the</b> upright <b>boards</b> surrounding a well, and the animal is standing at the other end in the public domain. In such a case, it is prohibited to fill a bucket with water in the area enclosed by the boards and hold it before his animal, unless the animal is within the enclosed area. This is a rabbinical decree, lest <b>at times one see that the manger was damaged</b> on the side in the public domain <b>and go to fix it and take the bucket with him,</b> thereby <b>carrying</b> it <b>from the private domain into the public domain.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But would he be liable in such a case? Didn’t Rav Safra say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>one who transfers objects from corner to corner</b> in a house, <b>and changed his mind about them</b> while carrying them <b>and took them out</b> to the public domain, <b>he is exempt because the lifting at the first moment was not for that</b> purpose of carrying out to a different domain; when he picked them up, he intended merely to move them around his house. Here too, then, he should not be liable, since when he picked up the bucket he did not intend from the outset to carry it into the public domain; accordingly, there is no room for such a decree.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> we must say that the decree is due to a different concern, that <b>at times one would fix</b> the manger <b>and</b> then <b>bring</b> the bucket <b>back in again, carrying from the public domain into the private domain.</b> In this case, he picks up the bucket with the intention of carrying it from a public domain into a private domain. In any case, no proof can be brought from this source.",
    "The Gemara cites a different proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>A camel whose head and most of its</b> body <b>are inside</b> a private domain <b>may be force-fed from inside</b> the private domain. <b>Now, force-feeding is like</b> the case where <b>he holds the bucket and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal, as one cannot force-feed an animal without holding it by its neck, <b>and</b> nonetheless <b>we require</b> that <b>its head and most of its</b> body be inside the domain where it is eating.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: A camel is different, as since its neck is long,</b> its head and most of its body must be inside; otherwise it could stretch its neck into the public domain, and the one feeding it might come to carry the bucket from the private domain into the public domain. In the case of other animals, however, there is no reason for such stringency.",
    "The Gemara attempts to cite yet another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>An animal whose head and most of its</b> body <b>were inside</b> a private domain <b>may be force-fed from inside</b> the private domain. <b>Now,</b> as stated above, <b>force-feeding is like</b> the case where <b>he holds the bucket and</b> also <b>holds</b> the animal, <b>and</b> nonetheless <b>we require</b> that <b>its head and most of its</b> body be inside the domain where it is eating. The Gemara refutes this argument: <b>What is</b> this <b>animal that is taught</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>also a camel.</b>",
    "The Gemara objects: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> as <b>animal</b> in one <i>baraita</i>, <b>and wasn’t it taught</b> as <b>camel</b> in the other <i>baraita</i>? The implication is that this law applies not only to camels, but to other animals as well.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Were</b> these two <i>baraitot</i> <b>taught next to each other?</b> Had both of these <i>baraitot</i> been taught together, we would indeed expect the <i>tanna</i> not to teach the same law using different formulations. However, since these two <i>baraitot</i> come from different sources, it is possible that one of the <i>tanna’im</i> referred to a camel with the generic term animal, and hence no proof can be brought from here. <b>This</b> same idea that a camel is different <b>was also taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer prohibits</b> this <b>in the case of a camel, since its neck is long.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Adda said:</b> Upright <b>boards surrounding wells were only permitted to Festival pilgrims.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>boards surrounding wells were permitted only for cattle?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>What is</b> the <b>cattle</b> mentioned here? It means <b>the cattle of festival pilgrims. However, a person</b>"
