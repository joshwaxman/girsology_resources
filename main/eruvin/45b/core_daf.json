    "<b>provided that the one does not carry</b> anything <b>from his</b> four-cubit limit <b>into that of his fellow.</b>",
    "With regard to a case where there <b>were three</b> people in this situation, <b>and</b> certain parts of the four cubits of <b>the middle one were subsumed within</b> the respective limits of each of <b>the others,</b> so that he shared a certain area with each of them, <b>he is permitted</b> to eat <b>with</b> either of <b>them, and they are</b> both <b>permitted</b> to eat <b>with him; but the two outer ones are forbidden</b> to eat <b>with each other,</b> since they share no common area.",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon said: To what is this comparable?</b> It is like <b>three courtyards that open into one another, and</b> also <b>open into a public domain.</b> If <b>the two outer</b> courtyards <b>established an <i>eiruv</i> with the middle one,</b> the middle one <b>is permitted to</b> carry to the two outer ones, <b>and they are permitted to</b> carry to <b>it, but the two outer</b> courtyards <b>are prohibited</b> to carry from <b>one to</b> the <b>other,</b> as they did not establish an <i>eiruv</i> with one another.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava raised a dilemma: What does Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri hold?</b> Does <b>he hold</b> that <b>ownerless objects acquire residence</b> for Shabbat, i.e., even an article that does not belong to anyone acquires residence at the onset of Shabbat and can therefore be carried two thousand cubits in each direction?",
    "<b>And</b> according to this understanding, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <b>should by right have disagreed</b> with the Rabbis even <b>about utensils</b> that were left in the field, i.e., that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, ownerless utensils can be moved two thousand cubits in each direction. <b>And the reason that they disagreed about a person</b> is <b>to convey the far-reaching</b> nature of the stringent ruling <b>of the Rabbis, that although there is</b> room <b>to say: Since</b> a person who is <b>awake acquires</b> for himself two thousand cubits, <b>he also acquires</b> them if he is <b>sleeping,</b> the mishna nonetheless <b>teaches us that</b> the Rabbis did <b>not</b> accept this argument, and this is why the dispute is taught specifically with respect to a person.",
    "<b>Or perhaps</b> we should understand his position differently, that <b>in general Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds</b> that <b>ownerless objects do not acquire residence</b> of their own. <b>But here,</b> with regard to a person, <b>the reason is as follows: Since</b> a person who is <b>awake acquires</b> for himself two thousand cubits, <b>he also acquires</b> them if he is <b>sleeping.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rain that fell on the eve of a Festival has two thousand cubits in each direction,</b> meaning that one is permitted to carry the rainwater within a radius of two thousand cubits. But if the rain fell <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is like the feet of all people,</b> as it did not acquire residence, and consequently one is permitted to carry this water wherever he is permitted to walk.",
    "<b>Granted,</b> it is understandable <b>if you say that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri holds</b> that <b>ownerless objects acquire residence;</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Nuri, and consequently the rain that fell on the eve of the Festival acquired residence in the spot where it fell.",
    "<b>However, if you say</b> that he maintains that <b>ownerless objects do not acquire residence,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>Neither</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Nuri, <b>nor</b> that of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as it clearly indicates that rain acquires a place of residence even though it has no owner. Rather, we must say that Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri is of the opinion that ownerless objects acquire residence, and this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with his opinion.",
    "<b>Abaye sat and recited this tradition. Rav Safra said to Abaye: Perhaps we are dealing with rain</b> that fell <b>near a city, and the inhabitants of that city had it in mind,</b> and that is why it acquires two thousand cubits in each direction.",
    "Abaye <b>said to him: It should not enter your mind</b> that such an understanding is correct, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>A cistern that belongs to an individual,</b> its water is <b>like the feet of that individual,</b> the owner of the cistern, in that it may be carried wherever he is permitted to walk. <b>And</b> a cistern <b>that belongs to a particular city,</b> its water is <b>like the feet of</b> the people of <b>that city,</b> in that it may be carried wherever the inhabitants of that city may walk, i.e., two thousand cubits in each direction from the city. <b>And</b> a cistern <b>that belongs to pilgrims from Babylonia</b> on the way to Eretz Yisrael, meaning that it belongs to all Jews and has no particular owner, its water is <b>like the feet of the one who draws</b> the water, in that it may be carried wherever he is permitted to walk.",
    "<b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A cistern that belongs to</b> one of <b>the tribes</b> and has no particular owner, its water <b>has two thousand cubits in each direction.</b> If so, these two sources <b>contradict each other,</b> as the mishna teaches that water that belongs to the entire community does not establish residence, whereas the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that it may be carried two thousand cubits from its place.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> in order to resolve the contradiction, <b>learn from here: This</b> source, which states that the water may be carried two thousand cubits, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri,</b> who says that even ownerless objects acquire residence; <b>that</b> source, which states that water that does not belong to any particular person is like the feet of the one who draws it, was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that ownerless objects do not acquire residence.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>when</b> Abaye <b>came before Rav Yosef, he said to him: This is what Rav Safra said, and this is what I answered him.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: And why did you not answer him from the</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself? If it should enter your mind that we are dealing with rain</b> that fell <b>near a city,</b> how can you understand the statement <b>that</b> the rainwater <b>has two thousand cubits in each direction?</b>",
    "According to your understanding, that the rainwater may be carried two thousand cubits because the inhabitants of the town had it in mind, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> said: The rainwater is <b>like the feet of the inhabitants of that city.</b> Rather, you must say that the inhabitants of the city did not acquire the water and that it may be carried within a radius of two thousand cubits, because the <i>baraita</i> was taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, that ownerless objects acquire residence.",
    "The Gemara further examines the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier. <b>The Master said:</b> If rain fell <b>on the Festival</b> itself, <b>it is like the feet of all people.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And why</b> should this be? The water <b>should have acquired residence in the ocean [<i>okeyanos</i>],</b> where it was when the Festival began. And since the water went out on the Festival beyond its limit after it evaporated and formed into clouds, moving the water more than four cubits should be prohibited.",
    "<b>Let us say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> was taught <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. Because if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, he said: The entire world drinks from the waters of the ocean;</b> that is to say, evaporated ocean water is the source of rain.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Here we are dealing with clouds that were</b> already <b>formed on the eve of the Festival.</b> Since these clouds were already formed before the Festival, the water did not acquire residence in the ocean or travel beyond its limit on the Festival.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps those</b> clouds that had already been formed on the eve of the Festival <b>went</b> away, <b>and these</b> clouds, from which the rain fell, <b>are others</b> that did acquire residence in the ocean? The Gemara answers: We are dealing here with a case <b>where there is</b> an identifying <b>sign</b> that these are the same clouds and not others.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that there is another reason we are not concerned that these might be other clouds: <b>This</b> matter of whether or not they are the same clouds pertains to <b>an uncertainty</b> with respect to <b>a rabbinic law,</b> and the principle is that with regard to <b>an uncertainty</b> concerning <b>a rabbinic law,</b> one may follow the <b>lenient</b> understanding.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Let</b> the water <b>acquire residence in the clouds,</b> where it was when the Festival began, and its limit should be measured from there. Since the <i>baraita</i> taught that the water is like the feet of all people, if so, <b>resolve from here</b> another dilemma, and say that <b>there is no</b> prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits above ten</b> handbreadths, and one is permitted to travel more than two thousand cubits above this height. <b>For if there is</b> a prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> above ten handbreadths, <b>let</b> the water <b>acquire residence in the clouds.</b>",
    "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Actually,</b> I can <b>say to you: There is</b> a prohibition of Shabbat <b>limits</b> even above ten handbreadths, <b>and the water</b> does not acquire residence in the clouds because it <b>is absorbed in the clouds.</b> Since water does not exist in its usual state within the clouds, but rather takes on a different form, it does not acquire residence there."
