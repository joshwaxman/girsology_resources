    "<b>A braid</b> of vines plaited around poles to form a partition <b>is permitted with regard to diverse kinds,</b> i.e., it is considered a partition that renders planting grapevines in close proximity to other crops permitted, <b>but not with regard to Shabbat. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Just as</b> such a braid is <b>not</b> considered a <b>partition with regard to Shabbat, so</b> too it is <b>not</b> considered <b>a partition with regard to diverse kinds.</b> Their opinions in the dispute here apparently contradict their opinions in the dispute cited above.",
    "<b>Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> and the other statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> poses <b>no difficulty, as this</b> statement, according to which such a braid of vines is an effective partition even with regard to Shabbat, reflects <b>his</b> own opinion; <b>that</b> statement, according to which it is an effective partition only with regard to diverse kinds, reflects the opinion <b>of his teacher,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. <b>However,</b> the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> poses <b>a difficulty.</b>",
    "<b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>there,</b> where Rabbi Yoḥanan ruled that a braid of vines is an effective partition with regard to diverse kinds, it is referring to a case where the vines were placed <b>on top of</b> the posts, while <b>here,</b> where he rules that it is ineffective even with regard to diverse kinds, it is referring to a case where they were attached to the posts <b>from the side,</b> it works out <b>well. However, if you say</b> that both <b>this and that</b> are cases where the vines were attached <b>from the side, what is there to say?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> both <b>this and that</b> are cases where the vines were attached to the side posts <b>from the side. There,</b> where Rabbi Yoḥanan ruled that the braid is an effective partition with regard to diverse kinds, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the poles were only <b>ten</b> cubits apart; <b>here,</b> where he rules that it is ineffective even with regard to diverse kinds, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the poles were <b>more than ten</b> cubits apart.",
    "<b>And from where do you say that we distinguish between</b> an opening of <b>ten</b> cubits <b>and</b> an opening of <b>more than ten</b> cubits? <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Reish Lakish: That is not</b> the way that <b>the incident</b> transpired. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua went to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri to study Torah, even though</b> Rabbi Yehoshua himself was an <b>expert in the <i>halakhot</i> of diverse kinds and found him sitting among the trees, and</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>stretched a vine from one tree to another and said to him: Rabbi, if there are grapevines here,</b> in the enclosed area, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>sowing</b> diverse kinds of seeds <b>here,</b> on the other side of the partition? Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri <b>said to him:</b> In a case <b>where</b> the trees are only <b>ten</b> cubits apart, it is <b>permitted;</b> however, <b>where</b> they are <b>more than ten</b> cubits apart, it is <b>prohibited.</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies the case: <b>With what are we dealing</b> here? <b>If you say</b> that the vines were placed <b>on top of</b> the trees, when they are <b>more than ten</b> cubits apart <b>is it prohibited? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to diverse kinds: <b>If there were forked reeds there and he plaited a braid</b> of vines <b>above them,</b> then <b>even</b> if the reeds were set <b>more than ten</b> cubits apart, <b>it is permitted?</b> With regard to diverse kinds, the form of a doorway when properly constructed is certainly effective.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to a case where he attached the vines to the trees <b>from the side, and he is saying to him: In</b> a case where the trees are only <b>ten</b> cubits apart, it is <b>permitted;</b> however, <b>in</b> a case where the trees are <b>more than ten</b> cubits apart, <b>it is prohibited?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that there is a distinction between poles that are ten cubits apart and poles that are more than ten cubits apart, and that this distinction resolves the contradiction between the two statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan.",
    "The Gemara now examines <b>the matter itself</b> with regard to Rav Ḥisda’s statement cited above. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> If <b>one prepared</b> an opening in <b>the form of a doorway from the side,</b> placing the horizontal cross beam to the sides, rather than on top, of the vertical posts, <b>he has not done anything.</b>",
    "<b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> also <b>said: The</b> opening in the <b>form of a doorway of which</b> the Sages <b>spoke must be strong enough to mount a door in it, and even</b> if it is merely a flimsy <b>door of straw.</b>",
    "<b>Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Yannai: The</b> opening in the <b>form of a doorway requires a mark</b> in the doorpost <b>for hinges.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is a mark for hinges? Rav Avya said: Loops [<i>avkata</i>]</b> into which the hinge is inserted, so that it will be possible to mount a door in the doorway.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa, the son of Rav Avya,</b> once <b>found the students of Rav Ashi</b> and <b>said to them: Did the Master,</b> Rav Ashi, <b>say anything with regard to</b> an opening in <b>the form of a doorway? They said to him: He said nothing,</b> implying that an indication for hinges is unnecessary.",
    "A Sage <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The form of a doorway of which they spoke</b> consists of <b>a reed from here,</b> on one side, <b>and a reed from there,</b> on the opposite side, <b>and a reed on top of them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Need</b> the lower reeds reach high enough <b>to touch</b> the upper reed, <b>or do they not need to touch</b> it? <b>Rav Naḥman said: They do not need to touch</b> it; <b>and Rav Sheshet said: They need to touch</b> it.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman went</b> ahead <b>and performed an action in the house of the Exilarch in accordance with his</b> own <b>opinion.</b> He constructed an opening in the form of a doorway such that the upper reed was not in contact with the lower reeds. <b>Rav Sheshet said to his attendant, Rav Gadda: Go, remove</b> those reeds and <b>throw them</b> away. The attendant <b>went, removed</b> the reeds, and <b>threw them</b> away. Members <b>of the Exilarch’s court found him</b> and <b>imprisoned him</b> for destroying the form of a doorway that permitted them to carry. <b>Rav Sheshet went</b> and <b>stood at the door</b> of the prison, and <b>called</b> out <b>to him: Gadda, go out</b> and <b>come</b> to me. The Exilarch’s men released him, and <b>he went out and came</b> to Rav Sheshet.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Sheshet</b> once <b>found Rabba bar Shmuel</b> and <b>said to him: Did the Master teach anything with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>the form of a doorway? He said to him: Yes, we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an arched gateway, Rabbi Meir deems</b> the owner <b>obligated to</b> affix <b>a <i>mezuza</i>, and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt. However, they</b> both <b>agree that if its supports,</b> the vertical sides of the gate before it arches, <b>are ten</b> handbreadths high, <b>that</b> the gate <b>requires</b> a <i>mezuza</i>.",
    "In order to explain the dispute, <b>Abaye said: Everyone agrees that if</b> the entire arch <b>is ten</b> handbreadths <b>high, but its supports are less than three</b> handbreadths high, or, <b>alternatively,</b> if <b>its supports are three</b> handbreadths high but the entire arch <b>is less than ten</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> the arch requires <b>no</b> <i>mezuza</i> <b>at all.</b> Both of these gateways lack the requisite parameters of the form of a doorway to require a <i>mezuza</i>.",
    "<b>Where they disagree is in</b> a case where <b>the supports are three</b> handbreadths high <b>and</b> the entire arch is <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> and at the height of ten handbreadths the arch <b>is less than four</b> handbreadths <b>wide; however, there is</b> room <b>to carve out</b> the area <b>to complete it to four</b> handbreadths, so that the opening of the arch measures four handbreadths wide and ten handbreadths high.",
    "Abaye explains the dispute: <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>one carves</b> out the area <b>to complete</b> the four handbreadths, i.e., the arch is considered as though it has already been carved out, and the opening has the necessary dimensions. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one does not carve out</b> the arch <b>to complete</b> the four handbreadths. Since the opening is not actually four handbreadths wide at a height of ten handbreadths, no <i>mezuza</i> need be affixed. Rabba bar Shmuel indicates that everyone agrees that the lintel need not touch the doorposts of the entrance; if the arch’s opening were four handbreadths wide at a height of ten handbreadths, it would require a <i>mezuza</i> even though the ceiling is separated by the arch and does not touch the doorposts directly. So too, with regard to the form of a doorway, the upper reed need not touch the lower reeds, contrary to the opinion of Rav Sheshet.",
    "Rav Sheshet <b>said to</b> Rabba bar Shmuel: <b>If you find them, do not say to</b> the members of <b>the Exilarch’s household anything with regard to this <i>baraita</i> of an arched gateway,</b> as it is proof against my opinion.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is a basic dispute with regard to the method of <b>rendering an alleyway fit</b> for one to carry within it on Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Both <b>a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam</b> are required. <b>Beit Hillel say: Either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Two <b>side posts</b> are required, one on each side of the alleyway.",
    "<b>In the name of Rabbi Yishmael, one student said before Rabbi Akiva: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about an alleyway that is less than four cubits</b> wide, as they both agree <b>that</b> carrying <b>is rendered permitted by either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam. With regard to what did they disagree? It is with regard to</b> an alleyway that is <b>wider than four cubits, and up to ten</b> cubits wide; <b>as Beit Shammai say:</b> It requires both <b>a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It requires <b>either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam. Rabbi Akiva said</b> to the disciple: It is not so, as <b>they disagree</b> both <b>about this</b> case, i.e., an alleyway that is less than four cubits wide, <b>and about that</b> case, i.e., an alleyway that is between four and ten cubits wide.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Before clarifying the various opinions in the mishna, the Gemara seeks to determine: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this mishna taught? Apparently, it is <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, nor in accordance with</b> the unattributed opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, who disagree about an alleyway that is open to a public domain on two opposite sides. The dispute is whether the form of a doorway on one end and a side post and a cross beam on the other end suffice to render it permitted for one to carry within it, or whether actual doors are required, at least on one end. However, they both agree that a side post and a cross beam alone are not effective. Since at this point the Gemara assumes that the dispute in the mishna between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel applies to all alleyways, whether closed on one side or open on two opposite sides to the public domain, these opinions reflect an entirely different position.",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: How is a closed alleyway rendered fit</b> for one to carry within it on Shabbat? <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> It requires both <b>a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam. And Beit Hillel say: Either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam.</b>",
    "The Gemara discusses the basis of each opinion. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> It requires both <b>a side post and a</b> cross <b>beam. Is that to say</b> that <b>Beit Shammai hold</b> that in order for an area to be considered a private domain, <b>four partitions are</b> required <b>by Torah law?</b> Since a side post with a cross beam qualifies as a partition, the fact that they do not permit carrying within an alleyway without a side post indicates that they maintain that a private domain requires four partitions.",
    "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> there is no proof, as one cannot conclude the parameters for a private domain based on the number of walls required to permit carrying. As with regard to the Torah prohibition <b>to throw</b> an object into a private domain from the public domain, <b>once</b> an enclosed area has <b>three</b> partitions, <b>one is liable</b> by Torah law. However, to permit one <b>to carry</b> an object within a private domain, the Rabbis decreed that it is not permitted <b>until there are</b> partitions on all <b>four</b> sides.",
    "The Gemara attempts to draw an inference from that which <b>Beit Hillel say: Either a side post or a</b> cross <b>beam</b> is required. <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>Beit Hillel hold that</b> at least <b>three partitions</b> are required <b>by Torah law,</b> and that an area with fewer is not considered a private domain?",
    "The Gemara rejects this argument as well: <b>No</b> proof can be cited from here. With regard to the Torah prohibition <b>to throw</b> an object into a private domain from the public domain, <b>once</b> an enclosed area has merely <b>two</b> partitions, <b>one is liable</b> by Torah law. However, to permit one <b>to carry</b> an object within a private domain, the Rabbis decreed that it is not permitted <b>until there are</b> partitions on <b>three</b> sides. A cross beam and a side post do not function as partitions but merely as conspicuous markers, so that one does not mistakenly carry outside the alleyway.",
    "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Two <b>side posts</b> are required. A <b>dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages: Did <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> intend to <b>say</b> that two <b>side posts and a</b> cross <b>beam</b> are required, adding a stringency to Beit Shammai’s opinion, that in addition to the cross beam not one, but two side posts are required? <b>Or perhaps he</b> intended to <b>say</b> that two <b>side posts without a</b> cross <b>beam</b> are required.",
    "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from that which was related in the <i>Tosefta</i>. There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer, who went to Rabbi Yosei ben Perida, his disciple,</b>"
