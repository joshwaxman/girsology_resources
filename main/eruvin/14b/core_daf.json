    "<b>in water</b>; specifically <b>in the water of a ritual bath.</b> The expression <b>“all his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:16) teaches that one must immerse in <b>water that his whole body can enter</b> at once. <b>And how much is that? A cubit by a cubit by the height of three cubits. And the Sages calculated</b> that the volume of <b>water</b> necessary for <b>a ritual bath</b> of this size <b>is forty <i>se’a</i>.</b>",
    "The Gemara now calculates <b>how many</b> ritual baths should have been contained in Solomon’s Sea. The volume of the sea was <b>five hundred</b> cubic <b>cubits,</b> as it was ten cubits in length, ten cubits in width, and five cubits in height. The minimum volume of a ritual bath is three cubic cubits. Therefore, <b>three hundred</b> cubic cubits is the volume of <b>a hundred</b> ritual baths, and <b>one hundred and fifty</b> cubic cubits is the volume of another <b>fifty</b> ritual baths. Consequently, <b>four hundred and fifty</b> cubic cubits <b>are enough</b> to contain a hundred and fifty ritual baths; but the volume of the sea was five hundred.",
    "The Gemara answers that there is an error in the calculation: <b>These</b> calculations with regard to the volume of the sea would <b>apply to a square,</b> but the <b>sea fashioned by Solomon was round,</b> and its volume was therefore smaller.",
    "The Gemara continues to ask: <b>Now, how much larger is a square</b> of ten-by-ten cubits <b>than a circle</b> with a diameter of ten cubits? <b>A quarter.</b> Consequently, <b>four hundred</b> cubic cubits of our original calculation must be reduced to three hundred, which is the volume of <b>one hundred</b> ritual baths; and the remaining <b>hundred</b> cubits must be reduced to seventy-five, which is the volume of <b>twenty-five</b> ritual baths. According to this calculation, Solomon’s Sea was the size of only <b>one hundred and twenty-five</b> ritual baths, not one hundred and fifty as stated above.",
    "In answer to this question, <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught</b> as follows: In the <b>sea that Solomon fashioned,</b> the <b>three lower cubits were square and</b> the <b>upper two were round.</b> Consequently, the three lower cubits of the sea contained the volume of a hundred ritual baths, and its upper two cubits contained the volume of fifty ritual baths, for a total of one hundred and fifty ritual baths.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>Although you cannot say the opposite,</b> that the bottom of the sea was round, <b>as it is written</b> in the verse that <b>its brim was round;</b> you can, <b>however, say</b> that only <b>one</b> cubit on top was round.",
    "The Gemara rejects this possibility: <b>This cannot enter your mind, as it is written</b> with regard to the sea: “And it was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was wrought like the brim of a cup, like the petals of a lily; <b>it contained two thousand <i>bat</i>”</b> (i Kings 7:26). <b>How much is</b> the measure of <b>a <i>bat</i>? Three <i>se’a</i>,</b> as the verse states: “Concerning the ordinance of oil, the <i>bat</i> of oil, you shall offer <b>the tenth part of a <i>bat</i> out of the <i>kor</i>,</b> which is a <i>ḥomer</i> of ten <i>bat</i>, for ten <i>bat</i> are a <i>ḥomer</i>” (Ezekiel 45:14). This proves that the <i>bat</i> is a tenth of a <i>kor</i>, or three <i>se’a</i>, as a <i>kor</i> is thirty <i>se’a</i>. Consequently, the sea, which contained two thousand <i>bat</i>, <b>contained six thousand <i>se’a</i>,</b> the volume of exactly one hundred and fifty ritual baths.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it written</b> elsewhere with regard to Solomon’s Sea: <b>“It received</b> and held <b>three thousand <i>bat</i>”</b> (ii Chronicles 4:5)? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is referring <b>to the heaped measure</b> of dry goods that the sea could hold, as dry goods can be heaped above the brim.",
    "<b>Abaye said: Learn from it</b> that <b>the surplus</b> of dry goods in a vessel relative to liquids <b>is one-third</b> of the contents of the vessel. <b>We also learned</b> the same thing in the following mishna: <b>A carriage, a box, and a cupboard, a round straw barrel, and a round barrel</b> made <b>of reeds, and the cistern of an Alexandrian ship,</b> which is a large vessel placed on a boat and filled with potable water, <b>although</b> these vessels <b>have bottoms,</b> i.e., they are receptacles, since they <b>have a capacity of forty <i>se’a</i></b> of <b>liquid, which is the</b> equivalent of <b>two <i>kor</i></b> of <b>dry</b> goods, they are <b>ritually pure.</b> Even if they come into contact with a source of ritual impurity, they do not become impure. Beyond a certain size, containers are no longer considered vessels and, consequently, cannot become ritually impure. This mishna states clearly that a vessel that holds forty <i>se’a</i> of liquids can hold two <i>kor</i>, or sixty <i>se’a</i>, of dry goods.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The side posts</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> of with regard to rendering an alleyway fit for one to carry within it, <b>their height</b> must be at least <b>ten handbreadths, and their width and thickness</b> may be <b>any amount. Rabbi Yosei says: Their width</b> must be at least <b>three handbreadths.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna: <b>The side posts</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> of, <b>etc.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say the mishna taught an unattributed ruling in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that in order to permit carrying in an alleyway, <b>we require</b> two <b>side posts?</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>No; what</b> is meant by the plural term <b>side posts? Side posts in general,</b> and not those required by a single alleyway. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let</b> the previous mishna <b>also teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a cross <b>beam</b> with the plural term cross <b>beams, and</b> we would say: <b>What</b> is meant by the plural term cross <b>beams?</b> Cross beams <b>in general.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: Those side posts that Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages disagreed about,</b> of which Rabbi Eliezer required two and the Sages sufficed with one, <b>their height</b> must be at least <b>ten handbreadths, and their width and thickness</b> may be <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much is any amount? Rabbi Ḥiyya taught: Even as</b> small as <b>the string</b> used to tie <b>a coat.</b>",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>one who erected a side post for half an alleyway,</b> i.e., he put it up halfway down the alleyway rather than at its entrance, <b>he has</b> the right to carry <b>only</b> in the inner <b>half of the alleyway,</b> but not in the outer half. The Gemara asks: <b>That is obvious;</b> what novel element was introduced here? <b>Rather, say: He may</b> carry in the inner <b>half of the alleyway</b> even though there is no side post at the entrance to the alleyway. The Gemara asks: <b>That too is obvious.</b> The Gemara explains that nonetheless there is a novelty here: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we should be concerned that</b> if it is permitted to carry in the inner half <b>one might come to use the entire</b> alleyway, the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>teaches</b> that carrying in the inner half is permitted.",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one who erected a side post in an alleyway and raised it three</b> handbreadths <b>from the ground, or distanced it three</b> handbreadths <b>from the wall, he has not done anything,</b> as it is not a valid side post. <b>Even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who said: We say</b> that objects separated by a gap of up to four handbreadths are considered <b>connected, that applies only above,</b> e.g., to a cross beam that does not reach the wall of the alleyway; <b>but below, since it is a partition through which goats can pass,</b> as a goat can pass through an opening three handbreadths high, even <b>he did not say</b> that they are considered connected.",
    "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: The width</b> of the side posts must be at least <b>three handbreadths. Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, not with regard to</b> preparing salt <b>brine [<i>hilmei</i>]</b> on Shabbat, <b>and not with regard to side posts.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinana said to him: With regard to brine you told us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, but <b>with regard to side posts you did not tell us</b> this; perhaps you have forgotten that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his view in that case. Rav Yosef asked: <b>What is different about brine,</b> with regard to which <b>the Sages disagree with</b> Rabbi Yosei? In the case of <b>side posts also the Sages disagree with him,</b> and therefore the <i>halakha</i> should not be in accordance with his view in either case. Rav Huna bar Ḥinana <b>said to him: Side posts are different, as Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, and therefore the <i>halakha</i> may be decided in accordance with their jointly held position.",
    "The Gemara reports that <b>Rav Raḥumei taught this</b> version of the previous discussion: <b>Rav Yehuda, the son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, not with regard to brine and not with regard to side posts.</b> At some later point, someone <b>said to him: Did you</b> really <b>say</b> this? <b>He said to them: No. Rava said,</b> reinforcing his words with an oath: <b>By God! He did</b> in fact <b>say this, and I learned it from him,</b> but he later retracted this ruling. <b>And what</b> is the <b>reason he retracted it? Due to</b> the well-known principle that <b>Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning [<i>nimmuko</i>] is with him,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> follows his opinion even against the majority view.",
    "<b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: What is the</b> accepted <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to the width of a side post? <b>He said to him: Go out</b> and observe <b>what the people are doing;</b> it is common practice to rely on a side post of minimal width.",
    "The Gemara notes that <b>there are</b> those <b>who taught</b> that <b>this</b> answer was given <b>with regard to this</b> discussion: <b>One who drinks water</b> to quench <b>his thirst recites</b> the following blessing prior to drinking: <b>By Whose word all things came to be. Rabbi Tarfon</b> disagrees and <b>says</b> he recites the blessing: <b>Who creates the many forms of life and their needs, for all that You have created. Rav Ḥanan said to Abaye: What is the <i>halakha</i>? He said to him: Go out</b> and observe <b>what the people are doing;</b> the customary practice is to say: By Whose word all things came to be."
