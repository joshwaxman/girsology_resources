    "<b>and bridges and monuments</b> over graves <b>in which there is a residence, one extends the measure</b> of that side of the city as though there were other structures <b>opposite them</b> in the adjacent corner of the city. <b>And</b> prior to measuring the Shabbat limit, <b>one renders</b> the city <b>like a square tablet so that it gains the corners,</b> although there are actually no houses in those corners.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a dispute with regard to the mishna’s terminology. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed: <b>One taught</b> that the term in the mishna is <b><i>me’abberin</i>,</b> with the letter <i>ayin</i>, <b>and one taught</b> that the term in the mishna is <b><i>me’abberin</i>,</b> with the letter <i>alef</i>.",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>The one who taught <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>alef</i> explained the term in the sense of <b>limb</b> [<b><i>ever</i></b>] by <b>limb.</b> Determination of the city’s borders involves the addition of limbs to the core section of the city. <b>And the one who taught <i>me’abberin</i></b> with an <i>ayin</i> explained the term in the sense of <b>a pregnant woman</b> [<b><i>ubbera</i></b>] whose belly protrudes. In similar fashion, all the city’s protrusions are incorporated in its Shabbat limit.",
    "Apropos this dispute, the Gemara cites similar disputes between Rav and Shmuel. With regard to <b>the Machpelah Cave,</b> in which the Patriarchs and Matriarchs are buried, <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed. <b>One said:</b> The cave consists of <b>two rooms, one</b> farther <b>in</b> than <b>the other. And one said:</b> It consists of <b>a room and</b> a second <b>story above it.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> this is understandable <b>according to the one who said</b> the cave consists of <b>one</b> room <b>above the other,</b> as <b>that is</b> the meaning of <b>Machpelah, double. However, according to the one who said</b> it consists of <b>two rooms, one</b> farther <b>in</b> than <b>the other,</b> in <b>what</b> sense is it <b>Machpelah?</b> Even ordinary houses contain two rooms.",
    "Rather, it is called Machpelah in the sense <b>that it is doubled with</b> the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, who are buried there <b>in pairs.</b> This is similar to the homiletic interpretation of the alternative name for Hebron mentioned in the Torah: <b>“Mamre</b> of <b>Kiryat Ha’Arba,</b> which is Hebron” (Genesis 35:27). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said:</b> The city is called Kiryat Ha’Arba, the city of four, because it is <b>the city of the four couples</b> buried there: <b>Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca,</b> and <b>Jacob and Leah.</b>",
    "They disagreed about this verse as well: <b>“And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel”</b> (Genesis 14:1). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> both identified Amraphel with Nimrod. However, <b>one said: Nimrod was his name. And why was his name called Amraphel?</b> It is a contraction of two Hebrew words: <b>As he said [<i>amar</i>]</b> the command <b>and cast [<i>hippil</i>] our father Abraham into the fiery furnace,</b> when Abraham rebelled against and challenged his proclaimed divinity. <b>And one said: Amraphel was his name. And why was his name called Nimrod? Because he caused the entire world to rebel [<i>himrid</i>]</b> against <b>God during his reign.</b>",
    "They also disagreed about this verse: <b>“There arose a new king over Egypt,</b> who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed. <b>One said:</b> He was <b>actually</b> a <b>new</b> king, <b>and one said:</b> He was in fact the old king, but <b>his decrees were new.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains. <b>The one who said</b> he was <b>actually</b> a <b>new</b> king based his opinion on the fact <b>that it is written</b> in the verse that he was <b>new. And the one who said that his decrees were new</b> derived his opinion <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is not written: And</b> the king <b>died, and</b> his successor <b>reigned,</b> as it is written, for example, with regard to the kings of Edom (Genesis 36).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who said that his decrees were new, isn’t it written: “Who knew not Joseph”?</b> If it were the same king, how could he not know Joseph? The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Who knew not Joseph”?</b> It means <b>that he</b> conducted himself <b>like one who did not know Joseph at all.</b>",
    "The Gemara cites a <b>mnemonic</b> of key words from a series of traditions cited below: <b>Eighteen and twelve we studied, with regard to David, and he will understand.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I spent eighteen days with Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished [<i>Beribbi</i>], and I learned from him only one matter in our Mishna.</b> In the phrase: <b>How does one extend cities,</b> the word <i>me’abberin</i> is spelled <b>with an <i>alef</i>.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is this so? Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished had twelve students, and I spent eighteen days among them, and I learned the heart of each and every one,</b> i.e., the nature and character of each student, <b>and the</b> extent of the <b>wisdom of each and every one?</b> How could Rabbi Yoḥanan say that he learned only one matter?",
    "The Gemara answers: It is possible that <b>he learned the heart of each and every one and the wisdom of each and every one,</b> but <b>he did not learn</b> substantive <b>tradition.</b> And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>From</b> the students <b>themselves he learned</b> many things; <b>from</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>himself he did not learn</b> anything beyond that one matter. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: Rabbi Yoḥanan meant to <b>say</b> that he learned only one matter <b>in our Mishna</b> from Rabbi Oshaya, but he learned other matters from him based on <i>baraitot</i> and other sources.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> about that period: <b>When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Oshaya,</b> it was so crowded with students that <b>we would sit four in each</b> square <b>cubit.</b> Similarly, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: When we were studying Torah with Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua, we would sit six in each</b> square <b>cubit.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> about his teacher: <b>Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished</b> was as great <b>in his generation as Rabbi Meir</b> was <b>in his generation: Just as</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Meir, in his generation his colleagues were unable to fully grasp</b> the profundity of <b>his thinking</b> due to the subtlety of his great mind, <b>so</b> it was with <b>Rabbi Oshaya; his colleagues were unable to fully grasp</b> the profundity of <b>his thinking.</b>",
    "Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The hearts,</b> i.e., the wisdom, <b>of</b> the <b>early</b> Sages were <b>like the doorway to the Entrance Hall</b> of the Temple, which was twenty by forty cubits, <b>and</b> the hearts <b>of</b> the <b>later</b> Sages <b>were like the doorway to the Sanctuary,</b> which was ten by twenty cubits. <b>And we,</b> i.e., our hearts, <b>are like</b> the <b>eye of a fine needle.</b>",
    "He explains: The term <b>early</b> Sages is referring to <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and the term <b>later</b> Sages is referring to his student, <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. Some say</b> that the term <b>early</b> Sages refers to <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua</b> and that the term the <b>later</b> Sages refers to <b>Rabbi Oshaya the Distinguished. And we are like</b> the <b>eye of a fine needle.</b>",
    "On the topic of the steady decline of the generations, <b>Abaye said: And we,</b> as far as our capabilities are concerned, <b>are like a peg in the wall with regard to</b> Torah <b>study.</b> Just as a peg enters a wall with difficulty, our studies penetrate our minds only with difficulty. <b>Rava said: And we are like a finger in wax [<i>kira</i>] with regard to logical reasoning.</b> A finger is not easily pushed into wax, and it extracts nothing from the wax. <b>Rav Ashi said: We are like a finger in a pit with regard to forgetfulness.</b> Just as a finger easily enters a large pit, similarly, we quickly forget our studies.",
    "The Gemara continues the discussion relating to study and comprehension, and cites that which <b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>the people of Judea, who were particular in their speech</b> and always made certain that it was both precise and refined, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who were not particular in their speech, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> this <b>matter at all dependent on</b> being <b>particular</b> with one’s language? <b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>the people of Judea, who were precise in their language and</b> who <b>would formulate mnemonics</b> for their studies, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who were not precise in their language and</b> who <b>would not formulate mnemonics, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b>",
    "Furthermore, with regard to <b>the people of Judea,</b> who <b>studied from one teacher, their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them,</b> as their teacher provided them with a consistent approach; however, with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who did not study from one teacher,</b> but rather from several teachers, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them,</b> as it was a combination of the approaches and opinions of a variety of Sages.",
    "<b>Ravina said:</b> With regard to <b>the people of Judea, who would</b> publicly <b>disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in the coming term so that everyone could prepare and study it in advance (<i>ge’onim</i>), <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>endured for them;</b> with regard to <b>the people of the Galilee, who would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in the coming term, <b>their Torah</b> knowledge <b>did not endure for them.</b>",
    "The Gemara relates that King <b>David would disclose the tractate</b> to be studied in advance, whereas <b>Saul would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied. <b>With regard to David, who would disclose the tractate, it is written: “Those who fear You will see me and be glad”</b> (Psalms 119:74), since all were prepared and could enjoy his Torah. <b>With regard to Saul, who would not disclose the tractate</b> to be studied, <b>it is written: “And wherever he turned himself</b>"
