    "<b>And</b> she requires <b>eight</b> immersions during the day to purify her <b>from</b> her <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> as it is possible that she experienced bleeding for three consecutive days, rendering her a greater <i>zava</i>, and one of those was on this day that she came before the court, and it is also possible that the day she arrived she did not experience bleeding, and she was a <i>zava</i> during her last clean day and had to immerse that day. If <b>she comes before us at night, we give her eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from her menstruation,</b> including one on the night that she comes before the court, <b>and seven</b> immersions during the day to purify herself <b>from</b> her <b><i>ziva</i>.</b>",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: With regard to her <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> she still <b>requires eight</b> immersions. Since it is possible that she experienced bleeding for the third day on the day before coming to the court, she might be a greater <i>zava</i>, who starts her clean days only the day after she arrived. In addition, any of the first seven days may be the last clean day, on which she has to immerse herself. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case she requires <b>seven</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>menstruation, and eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>.</b>",
    "The Gemara raises a further difficulty: If the woman comes <b>at night</b> to the court, she <b>requires eight</b> immersions to purify herself <b>from</b> her impurity of <b>menstruation.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> require her to immerse a total of only fifteen times when there are cases where she must immerse sixteen times?",
    "The Gemara answers: With regard to purifying herself from the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>, which</b> can be taught in <b>a distinct</b> manner, <b>as there is no difference whether she comes before us during the day</b> and <b>there is no difference whether she comes before us at night,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>counts</b> the fixed amount of eight immersions. By contrast, with regard to purifying herself from <b>menstruation, which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>cannot</b> teach in <b>a distinct</b> manner, <b>as when she comes before us at night she requires eight</b> immersions but if she comes before us <b>during the day</b> she does <b>not require eight</b> immersions, the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not count</b> both options, but mentioned only seven immersions, which is the minimum number required.",
    "The Gemara returns to the initial purpose of this discussion, which was to indicate that the Rabbis do not require all seven days of counting before the court. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we require</b> seven days of <b>counting before us, why do I</b> need <b>all of these immersions? She</b> should <b>count seven</b> clean days <b>and</b> only <b>afterward immerse. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from this</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva and <b>who say</b> that <b>we do not require</b> seven days of <b>counting before us?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi,</b> in rejection of this proof: But <b>didn’t you resolve</b> a difficulty in the <i>baraita</i>? Since you admit that the <i>baraita</i> in any event requires revision, <b>resolve</b> this difficulty too, <b>and say this:</b> If a woman comes and says: <b>I counted</b> clean days <b>but I do not know how many</b> days <b>I counted,</b> and I do not know <b>whether I counted during the days of menstruation or whether I counted during the days of <i>ziva</i>,</b> the court instructs <b>her to immerse fifteen immersions.</b> If so, there is no proof that the Rabbis hold that the counting does not need to be before the court.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: If it is referring to a case where the woman said: <b>I counted</b> clean days <b>but I do not know how many</b> days <b>I counted, it is impossible that she did not count at least one</b> clean <b>day.</b> If so, she should not be required to immerse on the eighth day, in which case <b>she is lacking</b> one <b>immersion,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> rules that she must immerse fifteen times.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, say</b> that she claims: <b>I do not know if I counted</b> any clean days <b>or I did not count</b> any clean days. Likewise, she does not know whether she saw the blood during her days of menstruation or during her days of <i>ziva</i>. Therefore, she must immerse fifteen times, as it is possible that she has not yet counted at all.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The corpses of <b>a <i>zav</i>, and a <i>zava</i>, and a menstruating woman, and a woman after childbirth, and a leper, who died, transmit ritual impurity by carrying</b> their corpses, <b>until the flesh decays.</b> With regard to the corpse of <b>a gentile who died,</b> although when alive he transmits impurity like a <i>zav</i>, once he dies he is <b>ritually pure</b> and is prevented <b>from transmitting impurity.</b>",
    "<b>Beit Shammai say:</b> The status of <b>all women</b> when they <b>die</b> is as though they were <b>menstruating women</b> at the time of death. Therefore, the garments that they were wearing before they died are impure and require immersion. <b>And Beit Hillel say: Only</b> a woman <b>who died</b> with the impurity of <b>a menstruating woman</b> has the status of <b>a menstruating woman</b> after death.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the corpse of one of these impure people transmits ritual impurity by carrying. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean by the term: <b>By carrying? If we say</b> that it <b>literally</b> means <b>by carrying,</b> that is difficult: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>every</b> other <b>corpse does not impart ritual impurity by carrying?</b> Since every corpse imparts impurity through carrying, why does the mishna need to specify this <i>halakha</i> in these specific cases?",
    "<b>Rather, what</b> does the mishna mean when it states: <b>By carrying [<i>bemassa</i>]?</b> It means imparting impurity <b>through a very heavy stone [<i>even mesama</i>].</b> There is a unique <i>halakha</i> with regard to the ritual impurity of a <i>zav</i> and a menstruating woman. If they sit on an item, even one that cannot become ritually impure, and beneath that item there is a vessel, although the weight of the <i>zav</i> or the menstruating woman has no physical effect on the vessel, it becomes ritually impure.",
    "The Gemara notes that the word <i>mesama</i> is based on a verse, <b>as it is written: “And a stone was brought and placed [<i>vesumat</i>] upon the mouth of the den;</b> and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords, that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel” (Daniel 6:18). Accordingly, the mishna is teaching that although a corpse does not normally impart ritual impurity to vessels under a heavy stone, these specific types of corpses do transmit impurity in this manner.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the Sages decreed that these specific types of corpses impart ritual impurity through a heavy stone? <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>a decree</b> due to the possibility that <b>perhaps</b> one of these people might <b>faint</b> while sitting on the heavy stone, and it might be mistakenly thought they are dead and do not impart impurity to the vessels beneath.",
    "A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> All of these types of corpses listed in the mishna impart ritual impurity through a heavy stone <b>until the belly</b> of the corpse <b>bursts.</b> The Sages imposed their decree only in cases where the corpse resembles a person who has fainted. Once the corpse is clearly no longer alive, it no longer imparts ritual impurity through a heavy stone.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the corpse of <b>a gentile who died,</b> although when alive he transmits impurity like a <i>zav</i>, once he dies he is ritually pure and is prevented from transmitting impurity. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the corpse of <b>a gentile who died is ritually pure</b> and is prevented <b>from transmitting impurity by carrying? Because his impurity</b> that he transmits even <b>when alive is not by Torah law, but by rabbinic law.</b> The Sages decreed that every living gentile imparts ritual impurity in the manner of a <i>zav</i>; they did not extend their decree to include the corpse of a gentile in the manner of the corpse of a <i>zav</i>.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught: The</b> wise <b>people of Alexandria asked twelve matters of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥinnana. Three</b> of them were <b>matters of wisdom, three</b> were <b>matters of <i>aggada</i>, three</b> were <b>matters of ignorance,</b> and <b>three</b> were <b>matters of behavior.</b>",
    "The Gemara lists the questions. <b>Three</b> were <b>matters of wisdom:</b> The first question was with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i> and a <i>zava</i> and a menstruating woman and a woman after childbirth and the leper, who died: Until when do they transmit ritual impurity by carrying?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: Until the flesh decays.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> taught in the mishna.",
    "The second question referred to the <b>daughter</b> of a wife who had been <b>sent away</b> by her husband, i.e., divorced, who then married another, but after her divorce from her second husband or his death she returned and remarried her first husband, to whom she is forbidden (see Deuteronomy 24:1–4), and a daughter was born from this marriage. <b>What</b> is <b>her,</b> i.e., the daughter’s, status <b>with regard to</b> marrying <b>a priest?</b>",
    "<b>Do we say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if</b> in the case of <b>a widow</b> married <b>to a High Priest, whose prohibition does not apply to all,</b> i.e., it is prohibited for her only to marry a High Priest (see Leviticus 21:13–15), and yet the lineage of <b>her son is flawed,</b> as he is disqualified from the priesthood, then in the case of <b>this</b> daughter of a remarried divorcée, <b>whose prohibition applies equally to all</b> men, <b>is it not right that her son</b> should be of <b>flawed</b> lineage? <b>Or perhaps</b> this comparison can be refuted: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a widow married to a High Priest?</b> It is notable in <b>that she herself is disqualified</b> from the priesthood, i.e., if a High Priest engages in intercourse with her she is disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, whereas a remarried divorcée is not disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>.",
    "Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them:</b>"
