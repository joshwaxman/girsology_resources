    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old, her vows are examined</b> to ascertain whether she is aware of the meaning of her vow and in Whose name she vowed. Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old</b> and has grown two pubic hairs, which is a sign of adulthood, even without examination <b>her vows are in effect. And one examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year until her twelfth birthday.",
    "With regard to a boy who is <b>twelve years and one day old, his vows are examined</b> to ascertain whether he is aware of the meaning of his vow and in Whose name he vowed. Once he is <b>thirteen years and one day old</b> and has grown two pubic hairs, even without examination <b>his vows are in effect. And one examines</b> his vows throughout <b>the entire thirteenth</b> year until his thirteenth birthday.",
    "<b>Prior to that time,</b> eleven years and one day for a girl and twelve years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is not</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is not</b> a valid <b>consecration. After that time,</b> twelve years and one day for a girl and thirteen years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We do not know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old her vows are examined, why do I</b> need the mishna to further state: Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect?</b> After all, by this stage she is already an adult. The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>one examines</b> her vows <b>forever,</b> even when she is an adult. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the vows of an adult are valid even without examination.",
    "The Gemara further asks: <b>And since</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect, why do I</b> need it to further state: <b>One examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year? The Gemara answers that this ruling is necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since the Master says</b> that <b>thirty days in a year are considered</b> equivalent to <b>a year,</b> in a case <b>where we examine her</b> for <b>thirty</b> days after she turned eleven <b>and she did not know</b> how <b>to utter</b> a vow <b>properly,</b> i.e., she did not have a clear understanding of the meaning of the vow, one might <b>say</b> that <b>one should examine</b> her <b>no further</b> until she reaches the age of twelve. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that she is examined throughout her twelfth year.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> only <b>these two clauses:</b> Once she is <b>twelve years and one day old her vows are in effect, and one examines</b> her vows throughout <b>the entire twelfth</b> year. Once both of these have been taught, <b>why do I</b> need the ruling: With regard to a girl who is <b>eleven years and one day old, her vows are examined?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers that this clause <b>was necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say:</b> In <b>an ordinary</b> case, a girl <b>requires examination in</b> her <b>twelfth</b> year, whereas <b>in</b> her <b>eleventh</b> year she <b>does not require examination. But</b> in a case <b>where we discern about her that she</b> has <b>a very sharp</b> mind, perhaps <b>she should be examined</b> already <b>in</b> her <b>eleventh</b> year. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that she is not examined in her eleventh year irrespective of how intelligent she is, as she is too young.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna to teach that <b>prior to that time</b> their vows and consecration are always not valid <b>and after that time</b> they are always valid? These <i>halakhot</i> can be inferred from the previous statements of the mishna. The Gemara answers that these rulings are necessary, as it might <b>enter your mind to say: These matters</b> apply only in a case <b>where they do not say:</b> We know in Whose name we vowed, when they are younger than the periods mentioned in the mishna, or: We do not know in Whose name we vowed, when they are older. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where they do say</b> such statements, perhaps <b>we rely on their</b> claim. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that when they are younger than the periods stated in the mishna their vows are never valid, and when they are older, their vows are always valid.",
    "§ The mishna indicates that the intellectual development of a girl is faster than that of a boy. In this regard, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> opinion, with regard to the periods of vows for girls and boys, is in accordance with <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. But <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says</b> the opposite, that the <b>matter stated</b> here <b>with regard to a girl is</b> actually <b>stated with regard to a boy,</b> whereas the <b>matter stated with regard to a boy is</b> in fact <b>stated with regard to a girl,</b> as the intellectual development of males is faster than that of females.",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As it is written,</b> with regard to the creation of woman: <b>“And the rib,</b> which <b>the Lord God</b> had taken from the man, <b>He made [<i>vayyiven</i>]</b> a woman, and brought her to the man” (Genesis 2:22). This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, granted a woman a greater understanding [<i>bina</i>] than</b> that <b>of a men.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, derive from this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>for that which Reish Lakish</b> taught, <b>as Reish Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, He made a woman, and brought her to the man.”</b> This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, braided</b> the hair of <b>Eve, and</b> then <b>brought her to Adam the first</b> man. <b>As in the cities overseas [<i>bikhrakei hayyam</i>] they call braiding</b> hair, <b>building [<i>benayita</i>].</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, what is the reason</b> that he maintains that the intellectual development of males is faster than that of females? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: Since a boy frequents his teacher’s house, cleverness enters his</b> mind <b>first.</b>",
    "§ The mishna teaches that there are three periods in the development of girls and boys: When their vows are examined, i.e., the twelfth year for a girl and the thirteenth year for a boy, which will be termed below: During the time; the period beforehand, when their vows are entirely invalid, called: Before the time; and after that period, when their vows are always valid, known as: After the time. But the mishna does not address the issue of their physical development during these periods, with regard to the appearance of two pubic hairs. In this regard, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a boy or girl developed pubic hairs <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> is this year considered <b>like</b> the development of signs indicating puberty <b>before</b> the <b>time</b> that the child reaches majority, and therefore they are not treated as signs indicating puberty, <b>or</b> is it considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this dilemma raised? <b>If</b> it is <b>with regard to vows,</b> the development of pubic hairs <b>is not considered as before</b> the <b>time, but</b> it <b>is not considered as after</b> the <b>time</b> either. Instead, the status of the vow is determined in accordance with the examination of the child’s understanding, as stated in the mishna.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is raised <b>with regard to punishments,</b> i.e., whether such a boy or girl is punished like an adult for violating the prohibitions of the Torah. <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? The Sages disagree. <b>Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina both say:</b> The development of pubic hairs <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> and therefore the boy or girl is not liable to receive punishment for his or her actions. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi both say:</b> The development of pubic hairs <b>during</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time,</b> and they are punished.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: And your mnemonic,</b> to remember which Sages said which ruling, is the verse: <b>“Now this [<i>vezot</i>] was the custom in former times in Israel”</b> (Ruth 4:7). The Sage whose name has a feminine form like the word <i>vezot</i>, namely, Rav Ḥanina, maintains that the development of pubic hairs during the time is considered as before the time, like the former times mentioned in the verse.",
    "<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi from the mishna: <b>After that time,</b> twelve years and one day for a girl and thirteen years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they say: We do not know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b> Rav Hamnuna infers from this ruling that if they issued this statement <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> it is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> even if they had developed two hairs.",
    "<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Hamnuna, in rejection of this proof: <b>Say the former clause</b> in the mishna: <b>Prior to that time,</b> eleven years and one day for a girl and twelve years and one day for a boy, <b>even if they said: We know in Whose name we vowed</b> and <b>in Whose name we consecrated, their vow is not</b> a valid <b>vow and their consecration is not</b> a valid <b>consecration.</b> One can infer the opposite from here, that if they issued this statement <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> it is considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time.</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so,</b> as <b>Rava erred. He thought</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna inferred from the superfluous</b> statement of the <b>mishna,</b> i.e., that the clause Rav Hamnuna cites is unnecessary for the <i>halakha</i> it states, which is why Rav Hamnuna inferred his conclusion from it. <b>And</b> therefore Rava responded that <b>rather than inferring from the latter clause</b> of the mishna that if the boy or girl claims not to know in Whose name he or she vowed during the time, it is considered as before the time, <b>let him infer from the former clause</b> that it is considered as after the time, as Rava demonstrated.",
    "The Gemara continues: <b>But it is not so;</b> rather, <b>Rav Hamnuna inferred</b> that it is considered as before the time <b>from the</b> statement of <b>the mishna itself,</b> without assuming that it is superfluous, as follows: In <b>that</b> mention in the mishna of: <b>After</b> that <b>time, what are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the boy <b>has not</b> yet <b>developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs, he is a minor. Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the boy <b>has developed two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b>"
