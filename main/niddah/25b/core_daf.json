    "<b>and dissolves it. Rather, one examines it with oil, as oil is soft and cleans</b> the embryo so that its sex can be discerned. <b>And one views</b> it <b>only in</b> the light of <b>the sun.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How does one examine</b> the embryo? The Gemara expresses surprise at this question: <b>How does one examine it</b> to determine whether it has the halakhic status of an offspring? Clearly, one examines it <b>as we</b> just <b>said. Rather,</b> the question is as follows: <b>In what</b> manner <b>does one examine it to ascertain whether it is male or</b> whether <b>it is female?</b>",
    "<b>Abba Shaul bar Nash, and some say Abba Shaul bar Remash, says: One brings a sliver of wood whose top is smooth, and he moves</b> it along the embryo <b>in that place,</b> i.e., the sex organ. <b>If</b> the sliver <b>is caught,</b> i.e., its movement is not smooth, <b>it is known that</b> the embryo <b>is male,</b> as its member interfered with the movement of the sliver. <b>And if</b> the sliver is <b>not</b> caught, <b>it is known that it is female.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>, that if the movement of the sliver is not smooth then the embryo is male, <b>only</b> if the sliver was moved along the sex organ of the embryo <b>from below to above; but</b> if it was moved <b>from the sides,</b> from one side to the other, the fact that it was not smooth does not prove that the embryo is male, as one can <b>say</b> that <b>the sides of the womb</b> interfered.",
    "<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The complete version of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>taught</b> as follows: <b>If it was female,</b> its vagina can be <b>discerned</b> by the appearance <b>of</b> a line like <b>a cracked</b> grain of <b>barley</b> oriented along the length of its body. <b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: But perhaps it is</b> not the vagina but <b>the recess between the testes,</b> and the embryo is male. <b>Abaye said</b> to him: <b>Now,</b> at this stage of development, <b>the testes</b> of the embryo <b>themselves are not discernible.</b> Is it possible that <b>the recess between the testes is discernible?</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> teaches that at this stage an embryo does not have the shape of arms and legs. <b>Rabbi Amram says</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when an embryo’s arms and legs start to take shape, <b>its two thighs</b> look <b>like two strings of crimson</b> thread <b>[<i>zehorit</i>]. And Rabbi Amram says with regard to</b> this matter that the thighs look <b>like</b> two strings <b>of the woof,</b> which are thicker than those of the warp. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And its two arms</b> look <b>like two strings of crimson</b> thread<b>. And Rabbi Amram says with regard to</b> this matter that the arms look <b>like</b> two strings <b>of the warp.</b>",
    "<b>Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, do not perform an action,</b> i.e., do not issue a practical ruling deeming a woman who discharges an embryo at this stage of development impure, <b>unless</b> the embryo <b>has grown hair.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say that? But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> with regard to a woman who discharged a gestational sac that <b>both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where the amniotic fluid is turbid, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where the fluid is clear, the woman must be <b>concerned</b> that the discharged gestational sac might have the status of an offspring, which would mean that she is impure even without the growth of hair on the embryo?",
    "<b>Rav Ami bar Shmuel says:</b> This matter was <b>explained to me by Mar Shmuel:</b> As for <b>being concerned</b> that perhaps she is impure, the woman must be <b>concerned,</b> due to the uncertainty whether she discharged an offspring. But <b>we do not give her</b> the <b>days of purity</b> that follow the period of impurity for a woman who gave birth, <b>unless</b> the embryo <b>has grown hair.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that Shmuel is uncertain</b> whether a gestational sac has the halakhic status of an offspring? <b>But</b> there was an incident involving <b>a certain gestational sac that was brought before Mar Shmuel,</b> and Shmuel <b>said: This</b> embryo <b>is forty-one days old. And</b> Shmuel subsequently <b>calculated</b> the amount of time that had passed <b>from the day that</b> the woman <b>went to</b> perform <b>immersion</b> in a ritual bath <b>until that day, and it was only forty days.</b>",
    "<b>And he said to</b> the local court: <b>This</b> husband <b>engaged in intercourse with</b> his wife when she was <b>a menstruating woman. They bound</b> the husband <b>and he confessed.</b> Since Shmuel was so proficient in embryology, why was he unsure about the halakhic status of a gestational sac? The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> himself <b>is different, as his strength,</b> i.e., his proficiency, was <b>great.</b> His general ruling that the halakhic status of a gestational sac is uncertain applies to people who are not as proficient as he is.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that a woman <b>who discharges a sandal</b> fetus or one who discharges an afterbirth observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth both to a male and to a female. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A sandal</b> fetus has <b>a similar</b> appearance <b>to</b> a certain <b>fish of</b> the <b>sea</b> known as a sandal fish;it looks as though <b>it is</b> a full-fledged <b>offspring from the outset, but it was mashed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A sandal</b> fetus has an appearance that is <b>similar to the tongue of the large bull.</b> Students <b>testified in the name of our teachers</b> that for <b>a sandal</b> fetus to have the halakhic status of an offspring, it <b>requires the shape of a face.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>requires the shape of a face</b> for it to have the status of an offspring. <b>Rav Adda says</b> that <b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A sandal</b> fetus <b>requires the shape of a face, but</b> the face does not need to be in its proper location; <b>even</b> if the face is <b>on the back of its</b> head, the fetus has the status of an offspring. <b>A parable to</b> which this situation can be compared is that of <b>a person who slapped another</b> in the face <b>and pushed his face back.</b> Here too, the face of the sandal fetus was pushed back due to external pressure.",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>In the days of Rabbi Yannai,</b> the other Sages <b>wished to deem pure</b> a woman who discharges <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that does not have the shape of a face. Rabbi Yannai said to them: You have deemed pure</b> women who discharge <b>offspring.</b> Rabbi Yannai holds that even a sandal fetus that does not have the shape of a face is considered an offspring.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that students <b>testified in the name of our teachers</b> that for <b>a sandal</b> fetus to have the halakhic status of an offspring it <b>requires the shape of a face? Rav Beivai bar Abaye says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in response: <b>This mishna,</b> i.e., the ruling to which the students testified, <b>is taught from the testimony of Rabbi Neḥunya.</b> In other words, this ruling is the opinion of an individual <i>tanna</i>, which is not accepted. <b>Rabbi Zeira says: Rav Beivai merited that his</b> ruling of <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> which he transmitted in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, was accepted. <b>As he and I were</b> both <b>sitting before Rabbi Yoḥanan when</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said this <i>halakha</i>, but</b> Rav Beivai <b>said it first</b> to the other Sages, <b>and</b> thereby <b>merited</b> that <b>it</b> was ascribed to him.",
    "§ The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the mishna <b>mention</b> that if a woman discharged <b>a sandal</b> fetus she observes the strictures of a woman who gave birth both to a male and to a female? Since <b>there is no</b> such thing as <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that</b> does <b>not</b> have another <b>offspring with it,</b> which mashed it and gave it the form of a sandal fish, in any case the woman has the impurity of a woman after childbirth.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>a female</b> offspring that <b>is born with</b> the sandal fetus, it is <b>indeed</b> unnecessary to mention the <i>halakha</i> of the sandal fetus, as the woman is in any case impure for two weeks. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where a male is born with it,</b> on account of which the woman would be impure for only seven days were it not for the sandal fetus.",
    "In this case, it is necessary for the mishna to state that the woman observes the strictures of one who gave birth both to a male and to a female, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since Rav Yitzḥak bar Ami says</b> that the sex of a fetus is determined at the moment of conception, as, if the <b>woman emits seed first she gives birth to a male</b> and if the <b>man emits seed first she gives birth to a female,</b> therefore, it can be concluded <b>from</b> the fact <b>that this</b> offspring that was born with the sandal fetus <b>is male,</b> that <b>this</b> sandal fetus <b>is also male.</b>",
    "Lest this reasoning be accepted, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the woman must observe the strictures of a woman who gave birth to a female as well. This is because one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>both</b> the man and the woman <b>emitted seed at the same time,</b> and consequently <b>this</b> offspring <b>is male and that</b> sandal fetus <b>is female.</b>",
    "<b>Alternatively,</b> it can be suggested that it is necessary for the mishna to state this <i>halakha</i> even with regard to a case where the twin of the sandal fetus is female, <b>as, if</b> the woman <b>gives birth to</b> the <b>female before sunset and</b> gives birth to the <b>sandal</b> fetus <b>after sunset,</b> which is considered the next day, the sex of the sandal fetus affects the count of the woman’s periods of impurity and purity.",
    "If the sandal fetus is male, the woman’s status as a woman after childbirth ends after the eightieth day from the birth of the female offspring, and <b>she counts the beginning of</b> the period when seeing blood renders her impure as <b>a menstruating woman from</b> the birth of <b>the first</b> offspring, i.e., the female. <b>But</b> if the sandal fetus is female, the woman has the status of a woman after childbirth until after the eightieth day from its birth, which is the eighty-first day from the birth of the first offspring. If so, she counts <b>the beginning of</b> the period when seeing blood renders her impure as <b>a menstruating woman from</b> the birth of <b>the last</b> offspring, i.e., the sandal fetus.",
    "The Gemara discusses why the case of a woman who discharged a sandal fetus is mentioned in other <i>mishnayot</i>, given that a sandal fetus always has a twin. First the Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> of a woman who discharged <b>a sandal</b> fetus <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna"
