    "<b>and she descended</b> to the ritual bath <b>and immersed</b> for the sake of conversion, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?",
    "Once again, the Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>If you say</b> that <b>we follow</b> the moment of <b>uprooting even though she can hold in</b> the urine, nevertheless one can claim that <b>this statement</b> applies specifically to <b>a Jewish woman, who is impure by Torah law. But</b> with regard to <b>a gentile <i>zava</i>, who is impure by rabbinic law,</b> it is possible that one does <b>not</b> follow the moment of uprooting. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in the application of this principle between the case of a Jewish woman and a gentile woman, as in both cases one follows the moment of uprooting. The Gemara again concludes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount. Shmuel says:</b> In order for <b>a <i>zav</i></b> to become ritually impure, he <b>must</b> experience a discharge substantial enough <b>to</b> cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the penis, as it is stated:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue, <b>or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount?</b> The Gemara answers that Shmuel <b>said</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> In order for <b>a <i>zav</i></b> to become ritually impure, he <b>must</b> experience a discharge substantial enough <b>to</b> cause <b>a blockage of the tip of the penis, but</b> the Rabbis <b>did not concede to his</b> opinion, as they maintain that any amount is sufficient. The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna agrees with the opinion of the Rabbis, whereas Shmuel agrees with the statement of Rabbi Natan in the name of Rabbi Yishmael.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> i.e., what is the source in the Torah for his ruling? The Gemara answers: His source is, as mentioned above, <b>that the verse states:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue, <b>or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3). This verse indicates that the emission must be enough to cause a blockage of his penis.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yishmael, what do they derive from this verse? The Gemara explains that according to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> to teach a different <i>halakha</i> with regard to a <i>zav</i>, that it is only a discharge which is <b>moist,</b> and which therefore could cause a blockage of the organ, that <b>imparts impurity, but a dry</b> discharge does <b>not impart impurity.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive that only a moist discharge imparts impurity? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the word <b>“run”</b> in the verse “And this shall be his impurity in his issue: Whether his flesh run with his issue.”",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this word? The Gemara explains that according to the Rabbis, <b>that</b> verse <b>comes to</b> teach the <b>number</b> of emissions by which a <i>zav</i> is rendered impure, as follows: The term <b>“his issue”</b> is <b>one</b> emission, the term <b>“his flesh run”</b> is another emission so that there are <b>two</b> emissions, and the term <b>“with his issue”</b> makes a total of <b>three</b> emissions. The verse thereby <b>teaches with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced three emissions that</b> he <b>is obligated to</b> bring <b>an offering</b> as part of his purification process.",
    "The Gemara continues: From the last section of the verse: <b>“Or his flesh be stopped from his issue,</b> it is his <b>impurity,”</b> it is derived that one is <b>impure</b> even by means of <b>part of his issue,</b> i.e., even if he did not experience three emissions. Here the verse <b>teaches with regard to a <i>zav</i> who experienced two emissions that</b> although he is not obligated to bring an offering, he <b>renders</b> a surface designated for <b>lying and</b> a surface designated for <b>sitting ritually impure</b> by lying or sitting on them, even without touching them directly. The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Yishmael, from where does he</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> of the requisite <b>number</b> of emissions? The Gemara answers that <b>he derives it from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Simai</b> said.",
    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Simai says: The verse enumerated two</b> emissions <b>and called</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>impure:</b> “When any man has an emission out of his flesh, due to his issue he is impure” (Leviticus 15:2). And yet, another verse enumerates <b>three</b> emissions <b>and it</b> too <b>called him impure:</b> “And this shall be his impurity in his emission: Whether his flesh runs with his emission, or his flesh be stopped from his emission, it is his impurity” (Leviticus 15:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> verses be reconciled? If one is impure after two emissions, for what purpose does the Torah mention three? It is to teach that <b>two</b> emissions are necessary <b>to</b> establish <b>impurity, and three</b> are necessary <b>to</b> render a <i>zav</i> liable to bring <b>an offering.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who derives both</b> the <i>halakha</i> of impurity and the obligation to bring an offering <b>from</b> the single verse: “And <b>this shall be his impurity in his issue,” what do they,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>do with</b> the other verse: <b>“When any man has an emission out of his flesh”?</b> The Gemara answers that this verse is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>zav</i> is not impure <b>unless</b> the discharge <b>emerges from his flesh.</b>",
    "The Gemara further asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the last part of the previous verse, which can be read as: <b>His issue is impure</b> (Leviticus 15:2)? The Gemara explains that this <b>teaches with regard to the issue</b> itself <b>that it is impure,</b> i.e., not only does it render the man who emitted it impure, but the substance itself is impure and imparts impurity to others by contact.",
    "§ With regard to the statement of the mishna that the issue of the <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission render them impure in any amount, <b>Rav Ḥanilai says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: Semen</b> imparts impurity <b>to</b> the man who <b>emits</b> it <b>in any amount,</b> whereas <b>with regard to one who touches</b> semen, it imparts impurity only <b>in</b> the amount of <b>a lentil-bulk.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that the emission of a <i>zav</i> and a seminal emission <b>impart impurity in any amount? What, is it not</b> referring to <b>one who touches</b> semen? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to</b> the man who <b>emits</b> it.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: There is an element of <b>stringency</b> which applies <b>to</b> the impurity of <b>semen that</b> does not apply <b>to</b> the impurity of the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, and</b> likewise there is an element of <b>stringency</b> which applies <b>to</b> the impurity of the carcass of <b>a creeping animal that</b> does not apply <b>to</b> the impurity of <b>semen.</b> The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: The <b>stringency</b> which applies <b>to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> but not to semen is <b>that</b> with regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal there is no differentiation in its impurity, which is not the case with regard to semen,</b> as certain types of semen impart impurity while others do not. The <b>stringency</b> which applies <b>to semen</b> but not to the carcass of a creeping animal is <b>that semen imparts impurity in any amount, which is not the case with regard to</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which must be at least a lentil-bulk.",
    "The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>to one who touches</b> semen, and the <i>baraita</i> rules that he is rendered impure by any amount? The Gemara again answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>of</b> the man who <b>emits</b> semen, whereas one who touches it becomes impure only if it is at least as large as a lentil-bulk.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of semen as <b>similar to</b> that of the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which indicates that <b>just as</b> the impurity of the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> is imparted <b>by contact, so too,</b> the impurity discussed in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>semen</b> is imparted <b>by contact. Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> in response: The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches the category of</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, and</b> it likewise <b>teaches the category of semen,</b> i.e., it is referring to these types of impurity in general, but this does not mean that these types of impurity are contracted in the same manner.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal not impart impurity in any amount? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 1:7): <b>The limbs</b> of impure bodies that are whole <b>have no</b> minimum <b>measure</b> with regard to imparting ritual impurity. Even if a limb is <b>less than an olive-bulk of</b> a human <b>corpse, or less than an olive-bulk of an animal carcass, or less than a lentil-bulk of</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> it imparts ritual impurity. If so, how can the <i>baraita</i> state that there is a minimum measure of a lentil-bulk with regard to the impurity of a creeping animal?",
    "The Gemara answers that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a limb is different, as</b> when <b>all of it</b> is intact <b>it stands in place of a lentil</b>-bulk, i.e., a whole limb is considered like a lentil-bulk of the carcass of a creeping animal, regardless of its actual size. The proof is <b>that if</b> it were <b>lacking</b> any slight <b>bit,</b> thereby causing this <b>limb</b> of a creeping animal to be less than a lentil-bulk, <b>would it impart impurity?</b> Certainly not. Clearly, then, the impurity of a limb is due to its wholeness, not its size.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The stringency that applies to the carcass of a creeping animal but not to semen is that with regard to a creeping animal there is no differentiation concerning its impurity, which is not the case with regard to semen. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the differentiation</b> with regard to <b>the impurity of semen? If we say</b> that this is referring to the difference <b>between</b> the semen of <b>Jews,</b> to which this impurity applies, <b>and</b> the semen <b>of gentiles,</b> to which it does not apply, <b>there is also</b> a differentiation with regard to the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal between <b>a sea mouse,</b> which is not impure, and <b>a land mouse,</b> which is impure.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the differentiation <b>between</b> the emission of <b>a minor,</b> which is not classified as semen and which does not render him impure, <b>and</b> that of <b>an adult,</b> which does render him impure. By contrast, there is no such differentiation with regard to the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal, as it imparts impurity regardless of its age and size.",
    "§ <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The amount of semen which imparts impurity to one who touches it is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the Torah <b>includes one who touches semen,</b> in addition to one who emits semen, as impure? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal: <b>“Or whoever</b> touches any creeping animal, whereby he may become impure” (Leviticus 22:5). It is inferred from the inclusive phrase “or whoever” that one who touches semen is also impure.",
    "<b>And in general, <i>tanna’im</i> disagree</b> with regard to the possibility of deriving a <i>halakha</i> in this manner. <b>As some say</b> with regard to a <i>halakha</i> that is inferred from another <i>halakha</i>: <b>Infer from it, and</b> derive the details of the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it</b> as well. <b>And some say</b> with regard to such a <i>halakha</i>: <b>Infer from it, but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place,</b> i.e., not all aspects of the source case are applied to this <i>halakha</i>.",
    "The Gemara explains how this general dispute applies to the case at hand. <b>According to the one who says</b> that one <b>infers from it and</b> again <b>from it,</b> the derivation is as follows: <b>Just as</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> imparts impurity <b>by contact, so too, semen</b> imparts impurity <b>by contact. And</b> one again infers <b>from</b> the impurity of the carcass of a creeping animal that <b>just as</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> imparts impurity <b>in</b> the amount of <b>a lentil-bulk, so too, semen</b> imparts impurity <b>in</b> the amount of <b>a lentil-bulk.</b>",
    "<b>And according to the one who says: Infer from it, but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to</b> its own <b>place,</b> one derives as follows: <b>Just as</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> imparts impurity <b>by contact, so too, semen</b> imparts impurity <b>by contact. But</b> one must <b>interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to</b> its own <b>place: Just as semen</b> imparts impurity <b>to the one who emits</b> it <b>in any amount, so too,</b> it imparts impurity <b>to the one who touches</b> it <b>in any amount.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, said to Rav Pappa: From where</b> do you infer <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> the impurity of one who touches semen <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“or whoever”</b> that is stated with regard to the impurity <b>of</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal? Perhaps he derives it from</b> the previous verse: <b>“Or from whoever the flow of seed goes out”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and everyone</b> agrees that when a <i>halakha</i> is derived from a verse dealing with the same matter, one should <b>infer from it and</b> derive the details of the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it</b> as well. If so, the amount of semen that imparts impurity by contact should be derived from the amount that renders the one who emitted it impure, which is any amount.",
    "The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>asked the <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> i.e., those who recite <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i>, whether the derivation of the <i>baraita</i> is from the verse dealing with the carcass of a creeping animal or from the one dealing with semen. They discovered that <b>there are those who teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the assumption of <b>Rav Pappa,</b> that it is derived from a creeping animal, <b>and there are those who teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan,</b> that the source is the verse referring to semen.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A baby girl,</b> even one who is <b>one day old,</b> who experiences an emission of blood, <b>becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b>a menstruating woman.</b> A baby girl who is <b>ten days old</b> who experiences an emission of blood for three consecutive days after the conclusion of the seven days fit for menstruation <b>becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>,</b> and is therefore obligated to observe seven clean days before immersion.",
    "<b>A baby boy,</b> even one who is <b>one day old, becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b><i>ziva</i>; and becomes impure with</b> the impurity of <b>leprous marks; and becomes impure with impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse; and he creates</b> a levirate bond requiring the widow of his childless brother <b>to</b> enter into <b>levirate marriage</b> with him; <b>and he exempts</b> his widowed mother <b>from the</b> obligation of <b>levirate marriage,</b> freeing her to marry anyone she chooses; <b>and he enables</b> his mother, an Israelite woman who is no longer married to his father, a priest, to continue <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>; and he disqualifies</b> his mother, the daughter of a priest who is no longer married to his father, an Israelite man, <b>from</b> continuing to partake of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> because the child is unfit to partake of <i>teruma</i>;"
