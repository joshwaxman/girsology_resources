    "Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, explained: <b>It is</b> only <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> who is permitted to examine the blood in this fashion, <b>as he is wise,</b> but <b>everyone</b> else <b>is not so wise</b> that they can successfully perform the examination without water.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Ḥanina’s wisdom causes me not to see blood</b> for a halakhic examination. When <b>I would</b> examine blood and <b>deem</b> it <b>impure, he would deem</b> it <b>pure,</b> and when <b>I would deem</b> it <b>pure, he would deem</b> it <b>impure.</b> Conversely, <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Rabbi Ḥanina’s humility causes me to see blood,</b> as I reason to myself: <b>If Rabbi Ḥanina, who is humble, places himself into</b> a situation of <b>uncertainty and sees</b> various types of blood to determine their status, should <b>I,</b> who am not nearly as humble, <b>not see</b> blood for an examination?",
    "<b>Rabbi Zeira says: The</b> complex <b>nature</b> of the residents <b>of Babylonia causes me not to see blood</b> for a halakhic examination, <b>as I say</b> to myself: Even matters <b>involving the</b> complex <b>nature</b> of people <b>I do not know;</b> can I then claim that <b>I know</b> about matters <b>of blood?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> the <b>matter</b> of the appearance of blood <b>is dependent on the nature</b> of people, i.e., that it changes in accordance with their nature? <b>But Rabba is</b> an example of someone <b>who knew about the</b> complex <b>nature</b> of the people of Babylonia, <b>and</b> yet <b>he did not know</b> how to distinguish between different types <b>of blood.</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Zeira took this factor into account and <b>said</b> to himself: <b>All the more so; if Rabba, who knew about the</b> complex <b>nature</b> of these people, nevertheless <b>would not see blood,</b> should <b>I,</b> who am unknowledgeable about the nature of these people, <b>see</b> blood for examination?",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Ulla happened</b> to come <b>to Pumbedita,</b> where <b>they brought blood before him</b> for an examination, <b>but he would not see</b> it, as <b>he said: If Rabbi Elazar, who was the master of Eretz Yisrael</b> in wisdom, <b>when he would happen</b> to come <b>to the locale of Rabbi Yehuda, he would not see blood, shall I see blood</b> here?",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And why would they call</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>the master of Eretz Yisrael</b> in wisdom? The Gemara explains that there was an incident <b>involving a certain woman who brought blood before Rabbi Elazar</b> for examination, and <b>Rabbi Ami was sitting before him.</b> Rabbi Ami observed that Rabbi Elazar <b>smelled</b> the blood and <b>said to</b> the woman: <b>This is blood of desire,</b> i.e., your desire for your husband caused you to emit this blood, and it is not the blood of menstruation. <b>After</b> the woman <b>left</b> Rabbi Elazar’s presence, <b>Rabbi Ami caught up with her</b> and inquired into the circumstances of her case. <b>She said to him: My husband was</b> absent <b>on a journey, and I desired him.</b> Rabbi Ami <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>“The counsel of the Lord is with those who fear Him;</b> and His covenant, to make them know it” (Psalms 25:14), i.e., God reveals secret matters to those who fear Him.",
    "The Gemara further relates that <b>Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur, sent blood before Rava</b> for examination, as she sought to convert and was practicing the <i>halakhot</i> of menstruation. At that time <b>Rav Ovadya was sitting before</b> Rava. Rav Ovadya observed that Rava <b>smelled</b> the blood and later <b>said to</b> the woman: <b>This is blood of desire. She said to her son: Come</b> and <b>see how wise the Jews</b> are, as Rava is correct. Her son <b>said to her: Perhaps</b> Rava was <b>like a blind man</b> who escapes <b>from a chimney,</b> i.e., it was a lucky guess.",
    "Ifera Hurmiz <b>then sent</b> Rava <b>sixty</b> different types of <b>blood,</b> some impure and others pure, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>all of them</b> Rava accurately <b>told her</b> their origin. The Gemara adds: <b>That last</b> sample of blood sent by Ifera Hurmiz <b>was blood of lice, and</b> Rava <b>did not know</b> what it was. He received <b>support</b> in this <b>matter</b> in the form of heavenly guidance, as he unwittingly <b>sent her</b> as a gift <b>a comb for killing lice. She said</b> in exclamation: <b>Jews, you</b> must <b>dwell in the chamber of</b> people’s <b>hearts.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara cites more statements of the Sages with regard to the examination of blood. <b>Rav Yehuda says: At first I would see blood,</b> i.e., perform examinations of blood, but I changed my conduct <b>when the mother of my son Yitzḥak,</b> i.e., my wife, <b>said to me</b> that she acts as follows: With regard to <b>this first drop</b> of blood that I see, <b>I do not bring it before the Sages, because it is not pristine</b> blood, i.e., other substances are mixed with it. After hearing this, I decided <b>I</b> would <b>no</b> longer <b>see</b> blood, as it is possible that the first drop, which I do not get to see, was impure.",
    "Rav Yehuda continues: But with regard to the examination of blood that a woman who gave birth emitted after the completion of her days of purity, i.e., at least forty days after giving birth to a male, or eighty after giving birth to a female (see Leviticus, chapter 12), in order to determine <b>whether she is ritually impure or pure, I certainly see</b> this blood and determine her status based on its color. This blood is clean, as the woman has been bleeding for a long period of time.",
    "§ The Gemara relates that <b>Yalta,</b> Rav Naḥman’s wife, <b>brought blood before Rabba bar bar Ḥana, and he deemed her ritually impure. She then brought</b> it <b>before Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, and he deemed her pure.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But how could</b> Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>act in this manner? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a halakhic authority who deemed</b> an item <b>impure, another</b> halakhic authority <b>is not allowed to deem</b> it <b>pure;</b> if one halakhic authority <b>deemed</b> a matter <b>prohibited, another</b> halakhic authority <b>is not allowed to deem</b> it <b>permitted?</b>",
    "The Gemara explains that <b>initially</b> Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>deemed her impure,</b> but he changed his mind <b>when</b> Yalta <b>said to him: Every day</b> that I bring blood <b>of this kind</b> of color to Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>he deems me pure, and specifically now</b> he issued a different ruling, <b>as he feels</b> pain <b>in his eye.</b> Upon hearing this, Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>deemed her pure.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> are people <b>deemed credible</b> to present claims such as the one presented by Yalta? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes; and</b> likewise <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A woman is deemed credible</b> if she <b>says: I saw</b> blood <b>like this</b> color, <b>but I lost it</b> before it could be examined.",
    "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a woman states to her friend who showed her blood: My blood, which has an appearance <b>like this, so-and-so, the halakhic authority, deemed</b> it <b>pure, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is she deemed credible concerning its status?",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>A woman is deemed credible</b> if she <b>says: I saw</b> blood <b>like this</b> color, <b>but I lost it.</b> This demonstrates that a woman may issue claims of this kind. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There</b> it <b>is different, as</b> in that case the blood <b>is not before her,</b> and therefore the Sages were lenient. But here, the woman’s friend can take her blood to a halakhic authority for examination.",
    "The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the incident cited above, <b>as Yalta brought blood before Rabba bar bar Ḥana, and he deemed her ritually impure;</b> she then brought it <b>before Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, and he deemed her pure. And</b> the Gemara asked: <b>How could</b> Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>act in this manner? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a halakhic authority who deemed</b> an item <b>impure, another</b> halakhic authority <b>is not allowed to deem</b> it <b>pure?</b>",
    "<b>And we say</b> in response that initially Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>deemed her impure,</b> but he changed his mind <b>when she said to him that every day</b> that she brings blood <b>of this kind</b> of color to Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>he deems her pure, and specifically now</b> he issued a different ruling, <b>as he feels</b> pain <b>in his eye.</b> The Gemara summarizes: The conclusion of the story was that upon hearing this, Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, <b>then deemed her pure. Evidently,</b> when a woman issues claims with regard to blood that is presented, <b>we deem her</b> claims <b>credible.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: That incident does not provide proof, as <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, relied on his studies</b> in his lenient ruling. At first, he was reluctant to issue his ruling, in deference to Rabba bar bar Ḥana, who had said the blood was impure. But when he heard Yalta’s explanation he deemed the blood pure, as he had originally thought. Therefore, there is no proof from there that a woman’s statements of this kind are accepted.",
    "§ The Gemara further relates: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi once <b>saw</b> a woman’s <b>blood at night and deemed</b> it <b>impure. He</b> again <b>saw</b> that blood <b>in the day,</b> after it had dried, <b>and deemed</b> it <b>pure.</b> He <b>waited one hour</b> and then <b>deemed</b> it <b>impure again.</b> It is assumed that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not conduct another examination at this point; rather, he reasoned that the previous night’s examination had been correct, and the blood’s color should be deemed impure because of how it had looked when it was moist. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi then <b>said: Woe is me! Perhaps I erred</b> by declaring the blood impure, as based on its color it should be pure.",
    "The Gemara questions this statement: <b>Perhaps I erred? He certainly erred, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>a halakhic authority may not say: If</b> the blood <b>were moist it would certainly have been impure,</b> and yet here, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deemed the blood impure based on that type of reasoning.",
    "The Gemara explains that the incident did not unfold as initially assumed. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi examined the blood three times, as he <b>said: A judge has only what his eyes see</b> as the basis for his ruling. <b>Initially,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>established the presumptive status</b> of the blood <b>as ritually impure,</b> but <b>when he saw in the morning that</b> its color had <b>changed, he said: It was definitely pure</b> last night as well, <b>and only</b> because it was <b>at night</b> I thought that it was impure, <b>because it could not be seen well.</b> Subsequently, <b>when he saw</b> after a short while <b>that</b> its color <b>again changed,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: This</b> blood <b>is impure, and it is gradually becoming lighter</b> as its color fades.",
    "With regard to the manner in which the Sages would examine blood, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would examine</b> blood <b>by candlelight. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosef, would examine</b> blood <b>between the pillars</b> of the study hall even <b>on a cloudy day,</b> despite the fact that it was not very light there. <b>Rav Ami bar Shmuel says: And</b> in <b>all these</b> cases, <b>one examines</b> blood <b>only between sunlight and shade. Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> One stands <b>in</b> a place lit by the <b>sun, and</b> he conducts the examination <b>under the shadow of his hand,</b> i.e., he places his hand over the blood. In this manner the color of the blood can be best discerned.",
    "§ The mishna states: <b>And</b> what is the color that is <b>like diluted</b> wine that is impure? It is specifically when the dilution consists of <b>two parts</b> water and one part wine, and specifically when it is from the wine of the Sharon region in Eretz Yisrael. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:"
