    "The mishna is referring to a case <b>where she discharges ritually impure blood in the midst of</b> discharging <b>ritually pure blood.</b> For example, if she normally first discharges blood that is not red, and it therefore does not render her impure, and then she experiences a discharge of red blood.",
    "The mishna teaches: <b>Or a type of</b> feverish <b>shuddering</b> overtakes her, <b>and likewise</b> the same applies with regard to any sensation <b>of the like.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by this last phrase? <b>Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> It serves <b>to include a woman whose head is heavy upon her or her limbs are heavy upon her, or she trembles or belches</b> constantly.",
    "<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The Sages <b>said, with regard to</b> establishing a set period of <b>days,</b> that <b>two</b> days are sufficient, i.e., if a woman experiences bleeding twice on the same date of the month or after the same interval, she has a fixed menstrual cycle. By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> based on a physical sensation, it is sufficient if she experiences bleeding even <b>once.</b> But <b>for those</b> sensations <b>which the Sages did not include</b> in the mishna, she has a fixed cycle only if she experiences bleeding <b>three</b> times accompanied by one of those symptoms.",
    "The Gemara asks: When Shmuel said: <b>For those which the Sages did not include, what</b> did he intend <b>to add? Rav Yosef says:</b> This serves <b>to add</b> the case mentioned above, i.e., <b>her head is heavy upon her, or her limbs are heavy upon her, or she trembles or belches</b> constantly. <b>Abaye said</b> to Rav Yosef: <b>What is</b> that addition <b>teaching us?</b> In effect, <b>it is</b> already taught in <b>the mishna, as Rabba bar Ulla explained</b> above that the additional phrase: The same applies with regard to any sensation of the like, serves to include those sensations. <b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> Shmuel’s phrase serves <b>to add</b> a case where <b>she ate garlic and saw</b> menstrual blood, <b>or ate onions and saw</b> menstrual blood, or <b>chewed pepper and saw</b> menstrual blood, i.e., these triggers can give rise to a fixed cycle, but only after three occurrences.",
    "<b>Rav Yosef said: I did not hear this tradition</b> concerning the opinion of Shmuel, that with regard to days a cycle is fixed if she experiences bleeding twice, whereas for physical sensations a cycle is fixed after one occurrence. Rav Yosef had fallen ill and forgotten his studies and was therefore unable to remember that such a ruling had been issued.",
    "His student, <b>Abaye, said to him: You</b> yourself <b>told us</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> it was <b>with regard to this</b> following matter that <b>you told</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>to us,</b> taught in the mishna below: If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on the <b>fifteenth day and she deviated</b> from the norm to see the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. If she deviated from the norm to see the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day three times, it becomes permitted</b> for her to engage in intercourse on the <b>fifteenth day, and she</b> has <b>established the twentieth day for herself</b> as the day of her fixed menstrual cycle, <b>as a woman establishes</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle only after she establishes it three times.</b>",
    "Abaye continues: <b>And you,</b> Rav Yosef, <b>said to us with regard to this</b> mishna that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: This is the statement of Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. But the Rabbis say:</b> If <b>she saw</b> a discharge of blood even once, she has a fixed cycle and <b>does not need to repeat</b> and experience bleeding a second time <b>or to repeat a third</b> time.",
    "<b>And we said to you:</b> Since <b>you said to us</b> that she does not need <b>to repeat</b> a second time, <b>is it necessary</b> for you to mention that she does not need <b>to repeat a third</b> time? <b>And you said to us</b> that when you said that she does not need <b>to repeat</b> a second time, this is referring <b>to</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle</b> based on a physical sensation, whereas when you said she does not need <b>to repeat a third</b> time, that is referring <b>to</b> a fixed cycle of <b>days.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why did Shmuel have to explain that the mishna is the statement of Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? <b>Let him say</b> simply that <b>this</b> mishna <b>is the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who always requires repetition three times to establish a presumptive status. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what <b>Shmuel teaches us: That Rabban Gamliel, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood <b>at the beginning of the</b> sensation that accompanies her <b>fixed</b> cycle, even if on one occasion she happened to experience bleeding only at the end of the sensation, <b>all the ritually pure items that she handled within the</b> duration of that sensation that accompanies her <b>fixed</b> cycle <b>are ritually impure.</b> If the woman was accustomed to experience bleeding <b>at the end of the</b> sensation that accompanies her <b>fixed</b> cycle, <b>all the ritually pure items that she handled within the</b> duration of that sensation that accompanies her <b>fixed</b> cycle <b>are pure.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even</b> specific <b>days and</b> specific <b>hours</b> determine a fixed menstrual <b>cycle:</b> If a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on a certain day of the month <b>at sunrise,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>her</b> to engage in intercourse with her husband <b>only at sunrise;</b> but during the night before and the following day, it is permitted for her to engage in intercourse. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Once sunrise passed and she did not menstruate, <b>the entire day is hers</b> and she may engage in intercourse, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei; but contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, intercourse the night before is prohibited.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what case did Rabbi Yosei say</b> that specific <b>days and hours</b> determine a fixed menstrual <b>cycle?</b> For example, if a woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood <b>on the twentieth day</b> and again <b>on the twentieth day, and in the sixth hour</b> of the day and again <b>in the sixth hour</b> of the day the next time; if the <b>twentieth day arrives</b> a third time <b>and she does not see</b> a flow of blood, <b>it is prohibited for her to engage</b> in intercourse for <b>the entirety of the first six hours</b> of the day; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei deems</b> it <b>permitted</b> for her to engage in intercourse <b>until the sixth hour</b> of the day, <b>and</b> says that she must be <b>concerned</b> only <b>during the sixth hour.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>the sixth hour passed and she did not see</b> a flow of blood, <b>it is prohibited for her to engage</b> in intercourse for <b>the entirety of the day;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And Rabbi Yosei deems</b> it <b>permitted</b> for her to engage in intercourse <b>from <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward,</b> i.e., from the beginning of the seventh hour.",
    "§ The mishna teaches with regard to a woman who <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on a certain day of the month at sunrise, that Rabbi Yehuda says: Once sunrise passed and she did not menstruate, the entire day is hers and she may engage in intercourse, but intercourse is prohibited the night before. The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The entire night is hers?</b> This indicates that she may engage in intercourse during the night.",
    "The Gemara explains that it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> when it is permitted for her to engage in intercourse the entire night, it is referring to a case <b>where she is accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>at the beginning of the day,</b> i.e., immediately after sunrise. <b>And there,</b> in the mishna, which deems it prohibited for her to engage in intercourse all night, it is referring to a case <b>where she is accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>at the end of the night,</b> i.e., just before sunrise.",
    "The Gemara cites further <i>baraitot</i> that deal with Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>prohibited for her</b> to engage in intercourse <b>before</b> the time of <b>her</b> fixed <b>cycle, but deems</b> it <b>permitted for her</b> to do so <b>after</b> the time of <b>her</b> fixed <b>cycle</b> if she did not experience bleeding then. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehuda <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited for her</b> to engage in intercourse <b>after</b> the time of <b>her</b> fixed <b>cycle but deems</b> it <b>permitted for her</b> to do so <b>before</b> the time of <b>her</b> fixed <b>cycle.</b>",
    "The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction: <b>And</b> this is <b>not difficult; here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that rules that it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse before the time of her fixed cycle is referring to a case <b>where she is accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>at the end of the night.</b> By contrast, <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that it is prohibited for her to do so after the time of her fixed cycle is referring to a case <b>where she is accustomed to see</b> a flow of blood <b>at the beginning of the day.</b>",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rava</b> actually <b>say this? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a menstruating woman: <b>“You shall separate the children of Israel from their impurity”</b> (Leviticus 15:31). <b>From here, Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> that there is <b>a warning to the children of Israel that they should separate from their wives close to</b> the time of <b>their</b> menstrual <b>cycles.</b>",
    "<b>And how</b> close? <b>Rava says: One</b> twelve-hour <b>period,</b> i.e., either from sunrise to sunset, or from sunset to sunrise. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to <b>an additional</b> twelve-hour <b>period,</b> i.e., the prohibition applies to the time of her expected period itself, either day or night, as well as the previous twelve hours? This is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who deems it prohibited for her to engage in intercourse only for the twelve hours of the expected time of her period. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>that</b> same twelve-hour <b>period.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>two</b> statements of Rava, i.e., both that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda and that a woman must separate for only one twelve-hour period? The Gemara answers that both are <b>necessary, because if</b> Rava had <b>taught us</b> only <b>this,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>to</b> the handling of <b>pure</b> items, <b>but with regard to</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>her husband,</b> it does <b>not</b> apply, and with regard to intercourse, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that even with regard to intercourse, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.",
    "<b>And</b> by contrast, <b>if</b> Rava had taught us only <b>that</b> statement, that she must wait a twelve-hour period, <b>I would say</b> that she must separate <b>close to</b> the fixed time of <b>her cycle</b> for <b>an additional</b> twelve-hour <b>period,</b> as suggested above. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, which indicates that she separates for only <b>that</b> single twelve-hour <b>period.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the woman <b>was accustomed to see</b> the flow of blood on the <b>fifteenth day and she deviated</b> from the norm <b>to see</b> the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse. If <b>she deviated</b> from the norm <b>twice,</b> then on both <b>this</b> day, the fifteenth, <b>and that</b> day, the twentieth, it is likewise <b>prohibited</b> for her to engage in intercourse.",
    "If <b>she deviated</b> from the norm <b>to see</b> the flow of blood <b>on</b> the <b>twentieth day three times, it becomes permitted</b> for her to engage in intercourse on the <b>fifteenth, and she</b> has <b>established the twentieth day for herself</b> as the day of her fixed menstrual cycle, <b>as a woman establishes</b> a fixed menstrual <b>cycle only after she establishes it three times. And</b> a woman <b>is purified from the</b> existing fixed menstrual <b>cycle,</b> in the sense that intercourse is permitted on that day, <b>only when she has been displaced from</b> that day <b>three times.</b>"
