    "<b>and she</b> herself <b>does not know</b> exactly <b>what</b> the appearance of the piece of flesh that <b>she miscarried</b> was, e.g., if it was lost. In this case <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds: Follow the majority of</b> miscarriages of amorphous <b>pieces</b> of flesh, <b>and the majority of pieces</b> of flesh have the appearance <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> impure <b>blood. And the Rabbis hold: We do not say: Follow the majority of</b> miscarriages of amorphous <b>pieces</b> of flesh. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s mention of three cases is meant to exclude this statement of Rabbi Yehuda, who rules that the woman is definitely impure based on a majority.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>five</b> distinct colors of <b>ritually impure blood in a woman: Red, and black, and like the bright</b> color of the <b>crocus [<i>karkom</i>]</b> flower, <b>and like water</b> that inundates red <b>earth, and like diluted</b> wine. <b>Beit Shammai say: Even</b> blood <b>like the water</b> in which <b>a fenugreek</b> plant is soaked, <b>and like the liquid</b> that drips from <b>roast meat,</b> are ritually impure, <b>and Beit Hillel deem</b> blood of those colors <b>ritually pure.</b> With regard to blood that is <b>green, Akavya ben Mahalalel deems</b> it <b>impure and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>pure.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> Even <b>if</b> the green blood <b>does not transmit impurity due to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of a blood <b>stain</b> or the blood of a menstruating woman, it is blood in that <b>it renders</b> food susceptible to <b>ritual impurity due to</b> its status as one of the seven <b>liquids</b> that render food susceptible to impurity. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Neither</b> in <b>this</b> sense, as the blood of a menstruating woman according to Akavya ben Mahalalel, <b>nor</b> in <b>that</b> sense, as a liquid that renders food susceptible to impurity according to Rabbi Meir, is green blood considered blood.",
    "The mishna asks: <b>What is</b> the <b>red</b> color that is impure? It is as red <b>as the blood</b> that flows from <b>a wound.</b> What is the <b>black</b> color that is impure? It is blood as black <b>as <i>ḥeret</i>.</b> If the black is <b>deeper than that,</b> the blood is <b>ritually impure;</b> if the black is <b>lighter than that,</b> the blood is <b>ritually pure. And</b> what is the color that is <b>like the bright</b> color of the <b>crocus</b> flower that is impure? It is <b>like the brightest</b> part <b>in</b> the flower, which is harvested to produce the orange-colored spice saffron.",
    "<b>And</b> what is the color that is <b>like water</b> that inundates red <b>earth</b> that is impure? It is specifically earth <b>from the Beit Kerem Valley and</b> specifically when <b>one inundates</b> the earth with enough <b>water</b> until it pools on the surface. <b>And</b> what is the color that is <b>like diluted</b> wine that is impure? It is specifically when the dilution consists of <b>two parts water and one</b> part <b>wine,</b> and specifically when it is <b>from the wine of the Sharon</b> region in Eretz Yisrael.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The fact that the mishna discusses the colors of ritually impure blood in a woman indicates that there is blood that is not impure. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that there is pure blood in a woman? Perhaps any</b> type of <b>blood that emerges from</b> a woman <b>is impure?</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to those who come before the court: <b>“If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood,</b> between plea and plea, and between leprous mark and leprous mark, even matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise, and get up unto the place that the Lord your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 17:8). When the verse states: “Between blood and blood,” it means <b>between pure blood and impure blood,</b> which demonstrates that there must be types of pure blood that are emitted by a woman.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If that is so,</b> then does the other expression in the verse: <b>“Between leprous mark and leprous mark,” also</b> mean: <b>Between a pure leprous mark and an impure leprous mark? And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> this is what it means, <b>is there</b> a type of <b>pure leprous mark? And if you would say</b> that there is in fact a pure leprous mark, according to the verse: “Then the priest shall look; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce pure the one that has the leprous mark; <b>it is all turned white: He is pure”</b> (Leviticus 13:13), <b>that</b> mark is not classified as a leprous mark; rather, it <b>is called a paleness,</b> as a leprous mark is by definition impure.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the phrase “between leprous mark and leprous mark” must mean the following: <b>Between the leprous marks</b> that afflict <b>man</b> (see Leviticus 13:1–46) <b>and the leprous marks of houses</b> (see Leviticus 14:33–53) <b>and the leprous marks of garments</b> (see Leviticus 13:47–59), as different <i>halakhot</i> pertain to these categories of leprous marks, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are all ritually impure.</b> Therefore, <b>here too,</b> when the verse states: “Between blood and blood,” it means: <b>Between the blood of a menstruating woman and the blood of a discharge [<i>ziva</i>], and they are all ritually impure.</b> If so, this verse cannot be cited as proof that there is a type of blood emitted by a woman that is pure.",
    "The Gemara questions this interpretation: This verse serves as the source for the areas of <i>halakha</i> for which a rebellious elder is liable to receive the death penalty for publicly ruling in contradiction to a decision of the Sanhedrin, as it states: “And the man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest that stands to minister there before the Lord your God, or to the judge, that man shall die; and you shall exterminate the evil from Israel” (Deuteronomy 17:12). With this in mind, the Gemara asks: <b>What is this</b> explanation? <b>Granted, there,</b> with regard to leprous marks, even if all the leprous marks are impure, <b>one can disagree</b> with the Sanhedrin <b>with regard to the leprous marks</b> that afflict <b>man, and</b> therefore the rebellious elder could potentially disagree with the court <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis.</b>",
    "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 4:11): <b>If</b> the <b>snow-white leprous mark [<i>baheret</i>],</b> which is one sign of leprosy, <b>preceded</b> the <b>white hair,</b> which is another sign, he is <b>ritually impure,</b> as stated in the Torah (see Leviticus 13:3). <b>And if</b> the <b>white hair preceded</b> the <b><i>baheret</i></b> he is <b>pure,</b> as this is not considered a sign of impurity. If there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to which came first, he is <b>impure. And Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It is <b>dull [<i>keha</i>]. And Rabba says,</b> explaining the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua: In the case of uncertainty, the leprous mark is deemed as though it is of <b>a dull</b> shade, and therefore the person is <b>ritually pure.</b>",
    "Likewise, <b>with regard to the leprous marks of houses</b> one can find a case where the rebellious elder might dispute the ruling of the Sanhedrin, such <b>as that dispute between Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and the Rabbis. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 12:3): <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: A house is never</b> deemed <b>impure</b> with leprosy <b>unless</b> the leprous mark <b>will be seen</b> to be the size <b>of two split beans,</b> and it is found <b>on two stones on two walls in a corner</b> between two walls. <b>The length of</b> the mark <b>is</b> that of <b>two split beans, and its width is</b> that of one <b>split bean.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The word <b>“wall” is written</b> in the verse, <b>and</b> the word <b>“walls” is written</b> in the same verse: “And he shall see the leprous mark…in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and their appearance is lower than the wall” (Leviticus 14:37). <b>Which is</b> one <b>wall that is like two walls? You must say: This is a corner</b> between two walls.",
    "Similarly, <b>with regard to the leprous marks on garments,</b> it is possible that the rebellious elder disputed the ruling of the Sanhedrin <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> a case where there is <b>a spread</b> of leprosy <b>in garments</b> that culminates with the garment’s being completely covered with leprous marks, <b>that</b> the garment <b>is pure,</b> just as the <i>halakha</i> is with regard to a leprous mark that fully covers a person?",
    "It is derived via a verbal analogy: <b>A bareness within [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bareness without [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>garments:</b> “And the priest shall look, after that the mark is washed; and, behold, if the mark has not changed its color, and the mark has not spread, it is impure; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a fret, whether the bareness be within or without” (Leviticus 13:55); <b>and a bald head [<i>karaḥat</i>] and a bald forehead [<i>gabbaḥat</i>]</b> are <b>stated with regard to</b> leprosy of <b>a person:</b> “But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white mark, it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead” (Leviticus 13:42).",
    "<b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a person, if the leprosy <b>spread to his entire</b> body he is <b>pure,</b> as the verse states: “Then the priest shall look; and behold, if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce pure the one who has the leprous mark; it is all turned white: He is pure” (Leviticus 13:13), <b>so too here,</b> with regard to garments, if the leprosy <b>spread to</b> the <b>entire</b> garment it is <b>pure.</b>",
    "The Gemara concludes: <b>But here,</b> concerning the phrase “between blood and blood,” <b>if there is no</b> type of <b>pure blood</b> at all, <b>with regard to what</b> issue could the rebellious elder <b>disagree</b> with the Sanhedrin? It must be that this verse is alluding to the fact that there is a type of blood of a woman that is pure.",
    "§ Once it has been established that there are types of blood that are pure and other types that are impure, the Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that those</b> types of blood that are not listed in the mishna are <b>pure, and these</b> ones that are mentioned in the mishna are <b>impure? Rabbi Abbahu said that the verse states:</b> “And the sun shone upon the water, <b>and the Moabites saw the water</b> some way off <b>as red as blood”</b> (II Kings 3:22), which indicates that blood is red. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that blood is red?</b> If so, one can <b>say</b> that only blood that is <b>red</b> like the blood of a wound is ritually impure, <b>and no more</b> colors of blood are impure.",
    "<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> in response: <b>The verse states,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman: “And she shall be purified from the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 12:7). The plural form of the word blood, <i>dameha</i>, indicates at least two types of blood. And another verse states: “And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked her source, and she has uncovered the source of <b>her blood [<i>dameha</i>];</b> both of them shall be cut off from among their people” (Leviticus 20:18). The use of the plural form of blood once again indicates another two types, which means that <b>there are four</b> types of blood stated <b>here.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that there are <b>five</b> types of impure blood in a woman, whereas the verses indicate that there are only four? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b>black</b> blood mentioned in the mishna <b>is</b> actually <b>red, but</b> its color <b>has faded,</b> which is why it looks black. Therefore, although the mishna lists five kinds of blood, there are only four basic types.",
    "<b>This</b> opinion, that black blood is actually red blood, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>black</b> color of blood that is impure is blood as black <b>as <i>ḥeret</i>.</b> If the black is <b>deeper than that,</b> the blood is <b>ritually impure;</b> if the black is <b>lighter</b> than that, <b>even</b> if it is still as dark <b>as blue,</b> the blood is <b>ritually pure. And this black</b> blood <b>does not blacken from its outset,</b> when it is inside the body; <b>rather, it blackens</b> only <b>when it is removed</b> from the body. This is <b>comparable to the blood of a wound,</b> which is initially red, but <b>when it is removed</b> from the body <b>it blackens.</b>",
    "§ The mishna states that <b>Beit Shammai say: Even</b> blood <b>like the water</b> in which <b>a fenugreek</b> plant is soaked, and like the liquid that drips from roast meat, are ritually impure. The Gemara asks: <b>But do Beit Shammai not accept</b> the exposition of Rabbi Abbahu that the two mentions of the plural form of blood: <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 12:7), and <b>“<i>Dameha</i>”</b> (Leviticus 20:18), indicate that <b>there are four</b> types of blood <b>here?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Beit Shammai <b>do not accept</b> this opinion of Rabbi Abbahu, and they maintain that there are more than four types of blood in a woman. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Beit Shammai <b>do accept</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s exposition, and the apparent contradiction can be resolved as follows: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say</b> with regard to the <b>black</b> blood mentioned in the mishna that it is not an additional type, as it <b>is</b> actually <b>red but</b> its color <b>has faded? So too,</b> with regard to the colors of blood mentioned by Beit Shammai, that of water in which a fenugreek plant is soaked, and that of the liquid that drips from roast meat, one can say that these are not additional types of blood. Rather, they too were initially red but their color <b>faded.</b>",
    "§ The mishna states: <b>And Beit Hillel deem</b> blood of those colors, i.e., the color of water in which a fenugreek plant is soaked or of the liquid that drips from roast meat, <b>ritually pure.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t this</b> opinion of Beit Hillel identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>?</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b>"
