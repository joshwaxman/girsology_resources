    "<b>it is uncertain</b> whether <b>that</b> woman has the status of one who gave <b>birth,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether she has the status of a woman who experiences <b>an irregular discharge of blood from the uterus [<i>ziva</i>].</b> Therefore, <b>she brings an offering,</b> like any woman after childbirth or after <i>ziva</i>, <b>but</b> the offering <b>is not eaten</b> by the priests. The reason is that perhaps she neither gave birth nor experienced <i>ziva</i>, and is therefore exempt from bringing an offering. Consequently, her bird sin offering is disqualified, and is forbidden in consumption, as a bird offering is killed by pinching its neck, which is not the valid manner of slaughtering a non-sacred bird.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The woman <b>brings an offering, and it is eaten.</b> The reason is that she is certainly either a woman after childbirth or a <i>zava</i>, <b>as opening of the womb is not possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood.</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i> disagree about whether opening of the womb is possible without a discharge of blood. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak maintains that this is also the issue in dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis in the mishna.",
    "§ <b>Some say another version</b> of the above discussion. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Yehuda deemed</b> the woman <b>impure,</b> despite the fact that no blood emerged, <b>only in</b> the case of <b>a piece</b> of tissue that has the appearance <b>of</b> one of the <b>four types of</b> ritually impure <b>blood, but</b> if it has the appearance <b>of other types of blood,</b> the woman <b>is pure.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Rav Hoshaya came from Neharde’a, he came and brought a <i>baraita</i> with him</b> that states: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a piece</b> of tissue that is <b>red, or black, green, or white, if there is blood</b> that emerges <b>with it,</b> the woman <b>is impure, and if not, she is pure. And Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case, where blood emerged, <b>and that</b> case, where no blood emerged, the woman <b>is impure.</b>",
    "The Gemara concludes its challenge: The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> both a case where the piece of tissue is <b>red or black,</b> and a case where it is not one of the four types of impure blood but it is <b>green or white,</b> i.e., in all of these cases the Rabbis hold that the woman is pure, <b>and</b> yet <b>Rabbi Yehuda disagrees</b> with their opinion.",
    "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>when Rabbi Yehuda disagrees</b> with the Rabbis, it is <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a red or black</b> piece of tissue, <b>but</b> with regard to the case of a <b>green or white</b> piece he does <b>not</b> disagree with them, as he concedes that the woman is pure; <b>but</b> if that is so, <b>for</b> the sake of clarifying <b>whose</b> opinion does the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> the case of <b>a green or white</b> piece of tissue?",
    "<b>If we say</b> that it comes <b>to</b> clarify the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that is unnecessary: <b>Now</b> that in the case of <b>a red or black</b> piece of tissue <b>the Rabbis deem</b> the woman <b>pure, is it necessary</b> to state that they deem her pure in a case of <b>a green or white</b> piece? <b>Rather, is it not</b> coming <b>to</b> clarify the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> teaching that the Rabbis deem the woman pure in this case, <b>but</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> with them and deems her impure? This contradicts the explanation of Shmuel.",
    "<b>Rather, Rav Yehuda says</b> there is a different explanation of the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda: <b>They disagree with regard to</b> whether or not <b>opening of the womb is possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood. And</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman experienced <b>difficulty in labor</b> during which blood emerged on <b>two</b> consecutive days, <b>and on the third</b> day <b>she discharged, but she does not know what she discharged, it is uncertain</b> whether she has the status of a woman who gave <b>birth,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether she has the status of a woman who experienced <b><i>ziva</i>.</b> Therefore <b>she brings an offering, but it is not eaten</b> by the priests.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The woman <b>brings an offering, and it is eaten.</b> The reason is that she is certainly either a woman after childbirth or a <i>zava</i>, <b>as opening of the womb is not possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood.</b> This is also the matter in dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, <b>Sumakhos says in the name of Rabbi Meir, and likewise Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya would say in accordance with his statement:</b> A Sage who is presented with this piece of tissue should <b>tear it</b> to examine it. <b>If there is blood inside it,</b> the woman is <b>ritually impure, and if not, she is pure.</b>",
    "The Gemara compares this <i>baraita</i> to the ruling of the mishna: This statement is basically <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> in the mishna, <b>but it is</b> more <b>far-reaching,</b> i.e., more stringent, <b>than that</b> ruling of <b>the Rabbis. It is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as they say</b> that <b>opening of the womb is possible without</b> a discharge of <b>blood,</b> whereas Rabbi Yehuda maintains that opening of the womb is impossible without a discharge of blood. <b>But</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is more <b>far-reaching than that</b> ruling of <b>the Rabbis, as they hold</b> that if blood emerges <b>with</b> the piece of tissue, then <b>yes,</b> the woman is impure, but if blood is found <b>inside</b> the piece of tissue, she is <b>not</b> impure; <b>and Sumakhos holds</b> that <b>even</b> if blood is found <b>inside</b> the piece, the woman is impure.",
    "<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, that <b>Rabbi Aḥa says:</b> One <b>tears it</b> open, and <b>if its interior looks red,</b> even if it contains no blood, the woman <b>is impure; and if</b> it does <b>not</b> have a red appearance, <b>she is pure.</b>",
    "The Gemara compares this <i>baraita</i> to the aforementioned opinion of Sumakhos: This ruling of Rabbi Aḥa is basically <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> as Rabbi Aḥa also requires that the interior of the piece of tissue must be examined to see if there is blood on the inside, <b>but</b> it is more <b>far-reaching than</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> as Rabbi Aḥa deems the woman impure even if the piece of tissue merely looks red on the inside but does not contain blood.",
    "<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, that <b>Rabbi Binyamin says</b> one <b>tears it</b> open to examine it. <b>If it contains a bone,</b> it is considered a fetus, and <b>its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman who gave <b>birth. Rav Ḥisda says: And</b> this applies <b>in</b> the case of <b>a white piece</b> of flesh; only in such a situation does the existence of a bone render it a fetus. <b>And likewise, when a pair</b> of Torah scholars <b>came from Ḥadyab, they came and brought a <i>baraita</i> with them:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who discharges a white piece</b> of tissue, one <b>tears it</b> open to examine it, and <b>if it contains a bone, its mother is impure</b> with the impurity of a woman who gave <b>birth.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, one <b>tears it</b> open to examine it. <b>If it contains</b> a quantity of <b>accumulated blood,</b> the woman <b>is impure; and if not, she is pure.</b> The Gemara comments: This is basically <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> that blood found inside the piece of tissue renders the woman impure, <b>but it is more lenient than all</b> the previous opinions, i.e., Sumakhos and Rabbi Aḥa, as according to Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai the woman is rendered impure only if there is a quantity of accumulated blood.",
    "§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya asked Rabbi Zeira:</b> In the case of a woman <b>who</b> inserted a tube into her vagina and <b>sees blood,</b> i.e., she found blood <b>in</b> the <b>tube, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yirmeya clarified his question: Since it is stated: “And if a woman has an issue, and her issue <b>in her flesh</b> is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days” (Leviticus 15:19), perhaps <b>the Merciful One states</b> in this verse that the woman is impure only if the blood is discharged through “her flesh” <b>and not through a tube. Or perhaps this</b> term: <b>“In her flesh,”</b> is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> a woman <b>becomes impure</b> by finding blood <b>inside</b> her vagina <b>just as</b> she becomes impure by experiencing bleeding <b>outside</b> her vagina, i.e., once the blood enters the vaginal canal from the uterus the woman is ritually impure.",
    "Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>The Merciful One states: “In her flesh,”</b> meaning that the woman is impure only if the blood is discharged through “her flesh” <b>and not through a tube. As, if</b> the term <b>“in her flesh” is necessary</b> to teach <b>that</b> a woman <b>becomes impure</b> by finding blood <b>inside</b> her vagina <b>just as</b> by seeing blood <b>outside</b> her vagina, <b>if so, let the verse say: In the flesh. What</b> is the significance of the fact that the verse states: <b>“In her flesh”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> the term, both that a woman becomes impure by the presence of blood inside her vagina, and that a woman who experiences bleeding that emerged through a tube is ritually pure.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, one <b>tears it</b> open to examine it; <b>if it contains</b> a quantity of <b>accumulated blood,</b> the woman <b>is impure, and if not, she is pure?</b> If a woman who sees blood that emerged inside a piece of tissue becomes impure, the same should apply to a woman who sees blood that emerged through a tube.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to a piece of tissue, the woman is impure, as <b>it is the manner of a woman to see blood inside</b> such <b>a piece</b> of tissue. Therefore, this blood fulfills the condition stated in the verse: “In her flesh.” By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of a tube, the woman should not be impure, as <b>it is not the manner of a woman to see blood</b> that emerged <b>through a tube.</b>",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a tube is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a woman <b>who discharges</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue, <b>even though</b> the piece <b>is full of blood, if there is blood</b> on the outside that emerges <b>with it,</b> the woman <b>is impure; and if not, she is pure. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The term <b>“in her flesh”</b> teaches that a woman is rendered impure only by blood that emerges through direct contact with her flesh, <b>and not</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a gestational sac, nor</b> by blood that emerges <b>in</b> an amorphous <b>piece</b> of tissue.",
    "The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> and asks: <b>Isn’t</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> identical to that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> The first <i>tanna</i> also says that a woman does not become impure due to blood found in a piece of tissue. Rather, the entire <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, and one must <b>say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should read as follows: Even if the piece of tissue is full of blood the woman is pure, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that the term <b>“in her flesh”</b> teaches that a woman is rendered impure only by blood that emerges through direct contact with her flesh, <b>and not</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a gestational sac, nor</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a piece</b> of tissue.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> If there is blood in the piece of tissue, <b>this is not menstrual blood, but rather the blood of</b> the <b>piece</b> of tissue. The Gemara asks: Doesn’t <b>the first <i>tanna</i> also deem</b> the woman <b>pure?</b> What is the difference between the opinion of the Rabbis and that of the first <i>tanna</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and that of the Rabbis <b>is</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the piece of tissue is <b>cracked,</b> and its blood comes in direct contact with the woman’s body.",
    "<b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the term <b>“in her flesh”</b> teaches that a woman is rendered impure only by blood that emerges through direct contact with her flesh, <b>and not</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a gestational sac, nor</b> by blood that emerges <b>in a piece</b> of tissue. <b>And the same is true with regard to</b> blood that emerges through <b>a tube. But this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the piece of tissue is <b>smooth, but</b> if it is <b>cracked,</b> the woman is <b>impure. What is the reason for</b> this exception? Since the blood comes in direct contact with the woman’s flesh, <b>we read</b> the term <b>“in her flesh” with regard to it,</b> i.e., it fulfills that condition.",
    "<b>And the Rabbis come to say: Even though</b> the piece of tissue <b>is cracked,</b> the woman is pure, as <b>this is not menstrual blood but rather the blood of</b> the <b>piece</b> of tissue. It can be inferred from here <b>that</b> if the blood is <b>menstrual blood,</b> the woman <b>is certainly impure, and</b> this is true <b>even</b> if the blood emerges <b>through a tube.</b> Accordingly, the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a tube is subject to a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>.",
    "<b>Abaye says</b> that this suggestion should be rejected: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a tube, everyone agrees that</b> the woman <b>is pure,</b> as derived from the term “in her flesh.”"
