    "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, just as there is a <i>tanna</i> who says</b> that <b>one day in a year is considered</b> equivalent to <b>a year, so too, there is a <i>tanna</i> who says</b> that <b>thirty days in a year are considered</b> equivalent to <b>a year.</b>The <i>baraita</i> states that according to Rabbi Meir, a girl two years and one day old is considered like a three-year-old, following the opinion that one day in a year is equivalent to a full year. Similarly, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that there is a second <i>tanna</i> who says that thirty days in a year are considered equivalent to a full year, and therefore a girl can be betrothed by intercourse from the age of two years and thirty days.",
    "<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yannai,</b> that Rabbi Meir requires a full three years, this <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult,</b> as it explicitly states that in Rabbi Meir’s opinion even a girl aged two years and one day can be betrothed by intercourse. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yannai.",
    "§ The last clause of the mishna teaches that if the girl is <b>less than that</b> age, i.e., younger than three years and one day, the status of intercourse with her is <b>like placing a finger into the eye. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What happens to <b>this hymen,</b> i.e., to the hymen of a girl under three with whom a man engaged in intercourse? Does it <b>disappear and come</b> back again later, <b>or perhaps it is not removed at all until after</b> she reaches the age of <b>three?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there in <i>halakha</i> between these two suggestions? The Gemara answers that there is a practical ramification in a case <b>where</b> a priest <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with a girl to whom he is married <b>within</b> her first <b>three</b> years, <b>and found blood</b> on her due to that intercourse, <b>and</b> again <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her many times, including <b>after</b> she turned <b>three, but</b> on that occasion <b>he did not find blood. If you say</b> that after engaging in intercourse when the girl is younger than three, the hymen <b>disappears and comes</b> back again, here one can maintain that it disappeared due to the first time they engaged in intercourse and did not grow back because <b>there was not enough time</b> without intercourse <b>for it</b> to grow back.",
    "<b>But if you say</b> that the hymen <b>is not removed</b> at all <b>until after</b> she reaches the age of <b>three,</b> the fact that <b>this</b> girl did not emit blood after three years must be because <b>another</b> man <b>engaged in intercourse with her</b> after she turned three, in which case she is classified as a <i>zona</i>, a woman who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by the Torah, and is forbidden to her husband the priest. The Gemara reiterates: <b>What,</b> then, is the resolution of the dilemma?",
    "<b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Ika, objects to this</b> explanation of the practical ramifications of the dilemma: <b>But</b> even if one maintains that the hymen of a girl younger than three disappears and grows back, one can still contend that this girl engaged in intercourse with another man, as <b>who will say to us that a wound that</b> was inflicted <b>within three years</b> of a girl’s birth <b>is not restored</b> and healed <b>immediately? Perhaps it is restored immediately, and this</b> girl did not emit blood because <b>another</b> man <b>engaged in intercourse with her</b> previously, and she is therefore a <i>zona</i> who is forbidden to a priest.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the practical <b>difference</b> between the two suggestions relates to a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with this girl <b>within</b> her first <b>three</b> years, <b>and found blood, and engaged in intercourse</b> with her again <b>after</b> she turned <b>three, and</b> again <b>found blood. If you say</b> that the hymen <b>disappears and comes</b> back again, <b>this</b> blood emitted when she is less than three years old <b>is blood</b> from the tearing of <b>the hymen,</b> which does not render her impure. <b>But if you say</b> that the hymen <b>is not removed</b> at all <b>until after</b> she reaches the age of <b>three,</b> then <b>this</b> blood she emitted when she was younger than three <b>is menstrual blood,</b> which renders her impure. <b>What,</b> then, is the resolution of the dilemma?",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: If the girl is <b>less than that</b> age of three years and one day, intercourse with her is <b>like placing a finger into the eye. Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach: Like placing a finger into the eye? Let</b> it <b>teach</b> simply: If she is <b>less than that</b> age, intercourse with her is <b>nothing. What, is it not</b> correct that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us,</b> by its comparison to an eye: <b>Just as</b> placing a finger in <b>an eye</b> causes it to <b>tear and tear again,</b> when another finger is placed in it, <b>so too</b> after the intercourse of a girl under three the <b>hymen disappears and comes</b> back again?",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving</b> a gentile woman called <b>Yusteni, the daughter of Asveirus, son of Antoninus,</b> a Roman emperor, <b>who came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>She said to him: My teacher, at what</b> age is <b>a woman</b> fit to <b>marry,</b> i.e., at what age is it appropriate for a woman to engage in intercourse, which would therefore be the appropriate time to marry? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to her:</b> She must be at least <b>three years and one day old.</b>",
    "Yusteni further inquired: <b>And at what</b> age is <b>she</b> fit to <b>become pregnant?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to her:</b> When she is at least <b>twelve years and one day old. She said to him: I married when</b> I was <b>six, and gave birth</b> a year later, <b>when</b> I was <b>seven. Woe for</b> those <b>three years,</b> between the age of three, when I was fit for intercourse, and the age of six, when I married, <b>as I wasted</b> those years <b>in my father’s house</b> by not engaging in intercourse.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And can</b> a minor of that age <b>become pregnant? But didn’t Rav Beivai teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman: Three women</b> may <b>engage in intercourse</b> while <b>using</b> a contraceptive absorbent <b>cloth,</b> a soft fabric placed at the entrance to the womb to prevent conception, despite the fact that this practice generally is prohibited. They are <b>a minor; a pregnant woman; and a nursing woman.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> specifies the reason for allowing these women to use contraceptive absorbent cloths: <b>A minor, lest she become pregnant and</b> perhaps <b>die</b> from this pregnancy; <b>a pregnant woman, lest</b> she be impregnated a second time and <b>her</b> older <b>fetus become</b> deformed into the shape of <b>a sandal</b> fish, by being squashed by the pressure of the second fetus; and <b>a nursing woman, lest</b> she become pregnant and her milk dry up, in which case <b>she weans her son</b> too early, thereby endangering him, <b>and he dies.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And who is</b> considered <b>a minor?</b> It is a girl <b>from the age of eleven years and one day until</b> the age of <b>twelve years and one day.</b> If she was <b>younger than that or older than that, she may go ahead and engage in intercourse</b> in her usual manner, i.e., without contraception. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Since it is assumed that a minor who is less than eleven years old cannot become pregnant, she is considered to be in no danger.",
    "<b>And the Rabbis say: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case of a minor girl who can become pregnant <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case of a minor girl who cannot become pregnant, she <b>may go ahead and engage in intercourse in her usual manner, and Heaven will have mercy</b> upon her and prevent any mishap, <b>as it is stated: “The Lord preserves the simple”</b> (Psalms 116:6). In light of the statement of Rabbi Meir, how could Yusteni have become pregnant at age seven?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Yusteni was able to become pregnant at such a young age because she was a gentile, and the verse states with regard to gentiles: <b>“Their flesh is the flesh of donkeys”</b> (Ezekiel 23:20). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Yusteni was lying when she said she became pregnant at age seven, as it is stated with regard to gentiles: <b>“Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying”</b> (Psalms 144:8).",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a certain woman who came before Rabbi Akiva</b> and <b>said to him: My teacher, I engaged in intercourse within three years</b> of my birth; <b>what</b> is <b>my</b> status with regard to marrying <b>into the priesthood?</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to her: You are fit</b> to marry <b>into the priesthood.</b>",
    "<b>She said to him: My teacher, I will tell you a parable; to what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a baby whose finger</b> one forcibly <b>dipped in honey.</b> On the <b>first time and</b> the <b>second</b> time, <b>he moans at</b> his mother for doing so, but on the <b>third</b> occasion, once he is used to the taste of honey, he willingly <b>sucks</b> the finger dipped in honey. She was insinuating to Rabbi Akiva that she engaged in intercourse several times, and although the first couple of times were against her will, the third incident was with her consent. Rabbi Akiva <b>said to her: If so, you are disqualified</b> from marrying <b>into the priesthood.</b>",
    "Rabbi Akiva <b>saw</b> his <b>students looking at each other,</b> puzzling over this ruling. <b>He said to them: Why is this matter difficult in your eyes? They said to him: Just as the entire Torah is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai, so too</b> this <i>halakha</i> of a girl who engaged in intercourse when she was <b>less than three years old,</b> i.e., that she is <b>fit</b> to marry <b>into the priesthood,</b> is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai,</b> and it applies whether she engaged intercourse against her will or with her consent. The Gemara notes: <b>And even Rabbi Akiva did not say</b> to the woman that she was unfit to marry into the priesthood because that is the <i>halakha</i>; rather, he did so <b>only to sharpen</b> the minds of his <b>students with</b> his statement, to see how they would respond.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a boy, <b>nine years and one day old,</b> whose brother had died childless, <b>who engaged in intercourse with his <i>yevama</i>,</b> his brother’s widow, the status of the intercourse is that of halakhic intercourse and <b>he acquires her</b> as his wife; <b>but he cannot give</b> her <b>a bill of divorce,</b> if he chooses to end the marriage, <b>until he reaches majority.</b>",
    "<b>And he becomes ritually impure</b> after engaging in intercourse <b>with a menstruating woman to</b> the degree that he <b>renders impure</b> all the layers of <b>bedding beneath</b> him, such that they become impure <b>like the upper</b> bedding covering a <i>zav</i>. Accordingly, the bedding assumes first-degree ritual impurity status and does not become a primary source of ritual impurity, and it renders impure food and drink and does not render impure people and vessels.",
    "<b>And</b> if he is disqualified from the priesthood and the woman with whom he engages in intercourse is the daughter of a priest, <b>he disqualifies</b> her from partaking of <i>teruma</i>; <b>but</b> if he is a priest who marries an Israelite woman, <b>he does not enable</b> her <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>. And</b> if he engages in bestiality, <b>he disqualifies the animal from</b> being sacrificed <b>upon the altar, and</b> the animal <b>is stoned due to his</b> act. <b>And if he engaged in intercourse with one of all those with whom relations are forbidden,</b> as <b>stated in the Torah,</b> e.g., his aunt or his mother, <b>they are executed</b> by the court <b>due to</b> having engaged in intercourse with <b>him,</b> because they are adults; <b>but he is exempt,</b> as he is a minor.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a boy aged nine years and one day cannot give his <i>yevama</i> a bill of divorce until he reaches majority. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>when he reaches majority, is a bill of divorce enough to</b> enable <b>her</b> to marry any man? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Sages <b>rendered the</b> halakhic status of the act of <b>intercourse of</b> a boy <b>nine</b> years and one day <b>old like</b> that of <b>levirate betrothal</b> by means of money or a document performed <b>by an adult man,</b> which is an acquisition by rabbinic law? Accordingly, she is not his full-fledged wife.",
    "Therefore, one can assert as follows: <b>Just as</b> after <b>a levirate betrothal</b> performed <b>by an adult man,</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>must</b> give the <i>yevama</i> <b>a bill of divorce to</b> release her from <b>his levirate betrothal and</b> perform <b><i>ḥalitza</i> to</b> release her from <b>his</b> levirate <b>bond, so too</b> with regard to <b>the intercourse of</b> a boy <b>nine</b> years and one day <b>old,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be that he <b>must</b> give her <b>a bill of divorce for his levirate betrothal and</b> perform <b><i>ḥalitza</i> to</b> release her from <b>his</b> levirate <b>bond.</b>",
    "<b>Rav said</b> in response that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying:</b>"
