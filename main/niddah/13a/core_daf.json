    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>any hand that is diligent to examine</b> bodily emissions to ascertain ritual impurity, <b>among women</b> such a hand <b>is praiseworthy. But among men</b> such a hand <b>should be severed,</b> as this action is apt to lead to a seminal emission for naught.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>women and what is different</b> about <b>men,</b> that women are praised for examining for bodily emissions while men are castigated for the same? The Gemara answers: <b>Women are not susceptible to</b> sexual <b>arousal</b> by this action, and therefore when a woman is diligent to examine herself she is considered <b>praiseworthy;</b> whereas <b>men, who are susceptible to</b> sexual <b>arousal</b> and may experience a seminal emission as a result of this contact, may not do so, and the hand of a man who conducts frequent examinations for emissions <b>should be severed.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> does the mishna state <b>specifically</b> among men that only the hand that is <b>diligent</b> to examine, i.e., that does so often, should be severed? Even <b>when</b> a man <b>is not diligent</b> to examine, but does so occasionally, this action is <b>also</b> apt to cause a seminal emission. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> Any hand that is <b>diligent</b> to examine, it states this only <b>with regard to women,</b> as men should not examine even occasionally.",
    "The Gemara continues to discuss the examination of men for seminal emissions. It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that men should not examine themselves, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to</b> an examination for <b>semen. But with regard to</b> a man who examines himself for gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>zov</i>], he too is praiseworthy</b> for examining diligently, <b>as women</b> are. The reason is that a man who experiences two such discharges is ritually impure but is not obligated to bring an offering, whereas one who experiences three such emissions must bring an offering as a <i>zav</i>. Therefore, it is important for a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge to examine and count his emissions carefully.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And even with regard to semen, if one wants to examine</b> himself <b>with a rock or with</b> a piece of <b>earthenware,</b> which are hard and will not warm the body, <b>he may examine</b> himself in this manner.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> may a man <b>not</b> examine himself <b>with</b> a linen <b>cloth? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A man <b>may examine himself with a cloth,</b> to see if he has emitted semen, <b>or with any</b> similar <b>item that he wants?</b> The Gemara answers: Just <b>as Abaye said,</b> with regard to a different issue, that it is referring <b>to a coarse cloth,</b> which will not warm one’s body, <b>here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a coarse cloth,</b> which will not lead to a seminal emission.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And where was</b> this statement <b>of Abaye stated?</b> It was stated <b>with regard to that which we learned</b> in a mishna (40a): If a priest <b>was eating <i>teruma</i> and he sensed that his limbs quaked,</b> indicating that a seminal emission was imminent, he should firmly <b>hold his penis</b> to prevent the emission from leaving his body, <b>and swallow the <i>teruma</i></b> while ritually pure.",
    "A difficulty was raised with regard to this mishna: May he actually <b>hold</b> his penis? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who holds his penis and urinates,</b> it is considered <b>as though he is bringing a flood to the world,</b> as masturbation was one of the sins that led to the flood (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 108b)? <b>Abaye says</b> in resolution of this difficulty that the mishna is referring to one who holds his penis <b>with a coarse cloth.</b>",
    "<b>Rava says</b> with regard to that mishna: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is referring to a priest who holds his penis <b>with a soft cloth,</b> and the reason it is permitted is that <b>once</b> the semen <b>has</b> already been <b>uprooted</b> from his body, it is <b>uprooted,</b> and his subsequent holding of the penis, even with a soft cloth, does not increase the emission of semen. <b>And Abaye</b> prohibits the use of a soft cloth even here, as he is <b>concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> due to the contact of this cloth one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission of semen. <b>But Rava is not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> one might <b>come to increase</b> the emission.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is Rava <b>not</b> concerned for this possibility? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>To what is this</b> repeated examination of a man <b>comparable? To</b> one who <b>places a finger in</b> his <b>eye, for as long as</b> the <b>finger</b> is <b>in the eye,</b> the <b>eye will tear and continue to tear.</b> Here too, the priest’s action will lead to an increased emission of semen.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>And Rava</b> would claim that if the priest’s limbs were not quaking and the semen was coming out in drops, there is indeed a concern that an examination might increase the emission. But when he feels his limbs quaking, this concern does not apply. The reason is that with regard to <b>any warming</b> of the body that leads to a seminal emission <b>and</b> that is <b>then</b> followed by another <b>warming at the time</b> when the semen is being uprooted, it is <b>uncommon</b> for the latter warming to increase the emission. Consequently, in this case the priest may hold his penis even with a soft cloth.",
    "The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who holds</b> his <b>penis and urinates,</b> it is considered <b>as though he is bringing a flood to the world.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: But</b> if one does not hold his penis, <b>small drops are sprayed on his legs, and he appears as one whose penis has been severed.</b> A man with that affliction is incapable of fathering children. People who see urine on his legs might suspect that he is suffering from that condition <b>and as a result</b> they will <b>cast aspersions about his children</b> and say <b>that they are children born from a forbidden relationship [<i>mamzerim</i>].</b>",
    "Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: It is preferable that</b> people <b>cast aspersions about his children that they are <i>mamzerim</i>, and he should not render himself wicked</b> even <b>one moment before the Omnipresent.</b>",
    "With regard to the same issue, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> the other <b>Rabbis</b> in response: It is <b>possible</b> for one to avoid spraying urine on his legs. How so? <b>Let a person stand on an elevated place and urinate</b> downward, <b>or urinate into</b> an area where there is <b>loose soil,</b> which absorbs the urine, so that it does not ricochet upward, <b>and he should not render himself wicked</b> even <b>one moment before the Omnipresent.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> of these replies <b>did</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>say to</b> the Rabbis <b>first? If we say</b> that it was the <b>first</b> statement, i.e., that one should not hold his penis even if people might cast aspersions about his children, that he <b>said to</b> the Rabbis <b>first,</b> and subsequently he told them that there was a way to avoid urine being sprayed on his legs, this is difficult; <b>after saying to them</b> that it is <b>a prohibition, would he then say to them</b> a practical <b>remedy?</b> By saying that one can avoid urine being sprayed on his legs, Rabbi Eliezer indicated that if one cannot do so he may hold his penis, which contradicts his other statement.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> clearly <b>he said this</b> practical solution <b>to</b> the Rabbis <b>first, and they</b> then <b>said to him:</b> If <b>one does not have an elevated place or loose earth</b> upon which he can urinate, <b>what</b> should he do? In response to this question, <b>he said to them: It is preferable</b> that people <b>cast aspersions about his children that they are <i>mamzerim</i>, and he should not render himself wicked</b> even <b>one moment before the Omnipresent.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why must one refrain <b>to that extent</b> from holding his penis? <b>Because</b> as the result of holding his penis <b>he</b> might <b>emit semen for naught. As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who emits semen for naught is liable</b> to receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Onan, son of Judah: “And it came to pass, when he engaged in intercourse with his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. <b>And the thing that he did was evil in the eyes of the Lord, and He slew him also”</b> (Genesis 38:9–10).",
    "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak and Rabbi Ami say:</b> One who emits semen for naught is considered <b>as though he sheds blood, as it is stated:</b> “But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot…Are you not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood, <b>you that inflame yourselves among the terebinths, under every leafy tree, that slay [<i>shoḥatei</i>] the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?”</b> (Isaiah 57:3–5). <b>Do not read</b> this word as <b><i>shoḥatei</i>; rather,</b> read it as <b><i>soḥatei</i>,</b> i.e., one who squeezes out [<i>soḥet</i>] semen is considered to have shed the blood of the children who could have been born from that seed.",
    "<b>Rav Asi says:</b> It is considered <b>as though he worships idols,</b> as <b>it is written here: “Under every leafy tree,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to the mitzva of eradicating idols from Eretz Yisrael: “You shall destroy all the places, where the nations that you are to dispossess worshipped their gods, <b>upon the high mountains,</b> and upon the hills, <b>and under every leafy tree”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2).",
    "§ With regard to the issue of holding one’s penis for the purpose of urinating, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yehuda and Shmuel were standing on the roof of the synagogue that was destroyed and rebuilt in Neharde’a. Rav Yehuda said to Shmuel:</b> What can I do? <b>I need to urinate.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: <i>Shinnana</i>, hold your penis,</b> so that the water does not fall onto the synagogue roof, <b>and urinate outward,</b> away from the synagogue.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>How could</b> Rav Yehuda <b>do so? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who holds his penis and urinates,</b> it is considered <b>as though he is bringing a flood to the world?</b>",
    "<b>Abaye says:</b> The Sages <b>rendered</b> the halakhic status of this situation <b>like</b> that of <b>a troop of marauders, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 70b): With regard to <b>a troop of marauders that entered a town,</b> if they did so <b>in a time of peace, open casks</b> of wine <b>are forbidden,</b> in case the marauders used the wine for libations in idol worship, whereas <b>sealed</b> casks <b>are permitted. In a time of war,</b> both <b>these and those are permitted, because</b> the marauders <b>do not have leisure to pour libations. Evidently, since</b> these marauders <b>are afraid, they will not come to pour libations. Here too,</b> in this incident involving Rav Yehuda, <b>since he is afraid he will not come to have</b> sexual <b>thoughts.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what fear is there here,</b> in the case of Rav Yehuda? The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that there is <b>the fear of the night and of the roof,</b> i.e., that he might fall. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the awe of his teacher,</b> Shmuel, is upon him. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the awe of the Divine Presence</b> that dwells in the synagogue is upon Rav Yehuda. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>the awe of his Master,</b> God, is upon him. Rav Yehuda was renowned for his fear of Heaven, <b>as Shmuel declared about</b> him: <b>This one is not born of a woman,</b> but is like an angel.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> a different answer, that Rav Yehuda was allowed to hold his penis while urinating because he <b>was married; as Rav Naḥman said: If one is married,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him to hold his penis while urinating, as his improper sexual urges are not as strong.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> that Shmuel <b>ruled for</b> Rav Yehuda <b>in accordance with this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>which Abba, son of Rabbi Binyamin bar Ḥiyya, teaches:</b> One may not hold the penis itself while urinating, <b>but</b> a man who wishes to urinate <b>may assist</b> the process <b>by</b> holding the <b>testicles from below.</b> Shmuel instructed Rav Yehuda to act in this manner. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Shmuel ruled</b> for Rav Yehuda <b>in accordance with that which Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is</b> a clear <b>demarcation</b> in the prohibition against holding one’s penis while urinating: <b>From the corona and below,</b> toward the tip of the penis, it is <b>permitted</b> to hold, as this will not lead to arousal."
