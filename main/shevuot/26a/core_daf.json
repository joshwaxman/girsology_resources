    "<b>Rav Pappa said one of those</b> statements, not Abaye.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One is liable only</b> for an oath on an utterance taken <b>about the future. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to an oath on an utterance: From the verse: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good do not apply? The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips,”</b> which includes other matters.",
    "<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for oaths referring <b>to the future. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for oaths referring <b>to the past? The verse</b> subsequently <b>states: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:4); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“To do evil, or to do good,”</b> referring exclusively to oaths <b>about the future.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: If so,</b> then <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good do not apply?</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva in response: It is derived <b>from an amplification</b> of the meaning <b>of the verse.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: If the verse is amplified for this,</b> i.e., to extend the <i>halakha</i> of an oath on an utterance to matters that do not involve doing evil or good, <b>the verse is amplified for that,</b> i.e., oaths about the past.",
    "The Gemara questions: <b>Rabbi Akiva said well</b> his critique of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael.</b> Why does Rabbi Yishmael disagree?",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is because <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> was the one <b>who served</b> as a disciple of <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana, who would interpret the entire Torah with</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization and a detail.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yishmael <b>also interprets</b> the Torah <b>with</b> the method of <b>a generalization and a detail. Rabbi Akiva</b> was one <b>who served</b> as a disciple of <b>Naḥum of Gam Zo, who would interpret the entire Torah with</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplification and restriction.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Akiva <b>also interprets</b> the Torah by <b>amplification and restriction.</b>",
    "<b>What</b> is the specific instance in this context where one finds <b>that Rabbi Akiva interprets</b> with <b>amplifications and restrictions?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“Or if anyone take an oath</b> clearly with his lips” (Leviticus 5:4), it <b>amplifies</b> the range of possible oaths for which one could be liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance. When the verse continues: <b>“To do evil, or to do good,”</b> it <b>restricts</b> that range. When it further continues: <b>“Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly</b> with an oath,” it <b>then amplifies</b> again. According to the hermeneutical principle that when a verse <b>amplified, and</b> then <b>restricted, and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter that was excluded by the restriction.",
    "<b>What</b> was included when the verse <b>amplified</b> the range of liability? <b>It amplified</b> it to include <b>all matters</b> about which one might take an oath. <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way did it <b>restrict</b> it when it continued: “To do evil, or to do good”? It <b>restricted</b> the range of liability for an oath on an utterance to exclude an oath that is <b>a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> i.e., an oath to refrain from performing a mitzva.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yishmael interprets</b> the verse following the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization and a detail: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), is <b>a generalization; “to do evil, or to do good,”</b> is <b>a detail; “whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly</b> with an oath,” the verse <b>then</b> further <b>generalized.</b> There is a hermeneutical principle that when a verse contains <b>a generalization, and a detail, and</b> another <b>generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the detail</b> in the verse is <b>explicitly</b> an oath referring <b>to the future, so too, all</b> the oaths for which one is liable must be referring <b>to the future.</b>",
    "<b>The generalization serves to include even</b> those <b>matters that do not concern doing evil or doing good</b> when they refer <b>to the future; the detail serves to exclude even matters that concern doing evil or doing good</b> when they refer <b>to the past.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>I will reverse</b> it and say that the generalization serves to include oaths concerning the past, and the detail serves to exclude matters that do not involve doing evil or doing good. Why is that not an equally legitimate interpretation of the verse?",
    "<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Yishmael understands that liability is extended to one whose oath <b>is similar to an oath “to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>He whose prohibition is due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3), is liable, as liability for an oath about the future entails breaking one’s word. <b>Excluded is that</b> oath <b>whose prohibition is not due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the verse<b>: “You shall not lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11), since liability for an oath about the past applies when the oath itself was a lie.",
    "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avin says</b> that there is a different explanation of Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion: <b>The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips</b> to do evil, or to do good,” referring to <b>one whose oath precedes</b> its <b>clarification,</b> i.e., the action that breaks it, <b>and not</b> to one who takes an oath <b>where the clarification,</b> i.e., the action prohibited in the oath, <b>precedes the oath. Excluded is that</b> oath where one said, for example: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat, where the action precedes the oath.</b>",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it is hidden from him; and, when he knows of it, be guilty in one of these things” (Leviticus 5:4). The phrase <b>“a man…with an oath”</b> serves <b>to exclude a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> from liability to bring an offering. The term <b>“and it is hidden”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> from liability one who broke his oath <b>intentionally,</b> as he does not deserve to be able to achieve atonement through bringing an offering.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: The term <b>“from him”</b> teaches that <b>one who was unaware of</b> his <b>oath,</b> i.e., forgot it, and subsequently broke it, is liable to bring an offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that an oath taker is also liable when he broke an oath <b>because he was unaware</b> that a particular item is forbidden as the <b>object</b> of his oath; therefore, <b>the verse states: “With an oath, and it is hidden from him.” He is liable for lack of awareness of the oath but he is not liable for lack of awareness of the object</b> of the oath.",
    "<b>The Master says</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“a man…with an oath”</b> serves <b>to exclude a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> such <b>circumstances?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: It is <b>as</b> it was <b>with Rav Kahana and Rav Asi,</b> who, <b>when they were standing up in the presence of Rav,</b> their teacher, at the conclusion of a lesson, disagreed with regard to exactly what he said. One <b>Sage said:</b> On my <b>oath Rav said like this, and</b> the other <b>Sage said:</b> On my <b>oath Rav said like that. When they came before Rav</b> to clarify what he had said, <b>he stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>one of them</b> had said. <b>The other said to</b> Rav: <b>Did I</b> then <b>take a false oath?</b>",
    "Rav <b>said to him: Your heart compelled you.</b> It is not regarded as a false oath, since at the time that you took the oath you were certain that you were telling the truth.",
    "§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The phrase <b>“and it is hidden from him”</b> teaches that <b>one who was unaware of his oath,</b> i.e., forgot it, and subsequently broke it, is liable to bring an offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that the oath taker is also liable when he broke the oath <b>because he was unaware</b> that a particular item is forbidden as the <b>object</b> of his oath; therefore, <b>the verse states: “With an oath, and it is hidden from him.” He is liable for lack of awareness of the oath, but he is not liable for lack of awareness of the object</b> of the oath.",
    "<b>They laughed at this in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, and said: <b>Granted, you find</b> lack of awareness of one’s <b>oath without</b> there being lack of awareness of <b>the object</b> of the oath, as in a case <b>where one said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat wheat bread, and he thought he had said: I will eat</b> wheat bread, <b>as</b> in that case <b>his oath is forgotten</b> and <b>the object</b> of it <b>is remembered. But</b> under <b>what circumstances</b> is there a case of lack of awareness of <b>the object</b> of the oath <b>without</b> lack of awareness of the <b>oath</b> itself?",
    "The Gemara suggests: It can be found in a case <b>where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat wheat bread, and he thought he had said:</b> On my oath I will not eat <b>barley</b> bread, <b>as</b> in that case <b>his oath is remembered by him</b> and <b>the object</b> of it <b>is forgotten.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Once the object</b> of the oath <b>is forgotten by him, that is</b> a case of <b>lack of awareness of his oath.</b>",
    "<b>Rather, Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The distinction made in the <i>baraita</i> between lack of awareness of one’s oath and lack of awareness of the object of one’s oath is not valid, and both <b>this and that are one</b> and the same.",
    "<b>Rav Yosef objects to this.</b> Is it <b>really</b> the case that <b>you do not find</b> a case of lack of awareness of <b>the object</b> of an oath <b>without</b> lack of awareness of the <b>oath? But you find</b> it in a case <b>where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat wheat bread, and he extended his hand to the basket to take barley bread, and wheat</b> bread <b>came up in his hand, and he thought it was barley</b> bread <b>and ate it.</b> That is a case <b>where his oath is remembered by him, and it is the object</b> of the oath <b>of which he is unaware.</b>",
    "<b>Abaye said to him: Don’t you deem him liable</b> to bring <b>an offering</b> for breaking his oath <b>only for that which he holds in his hand</b> and eats? When he eats the bread, that <b>is lack of awareness of the oath,</b> since he thinks that the item in his hand is permitted.",
    "The Gemara presents <b>another formulation</b> of this statement. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Ultimately, the offering he brings for this bread is in any event</b> due to <b>lack of awareness of the oath,</b> as he thinks that the item in his hand is permitted.",
    "<b>And Rav Yosef</b> could <b>say to you: Since were he to know of it that it is wheat</b> bread <b>he would refrain from</b> eating <b>it,</b> this should be regarded as a case of <b>lack of awareness of the object.</b>",
    "<b>Rava asked of Rav Naḥman:</b> In a case where one <b>has a lack of awareness of this,</b> the oath, <b>and that,</b> its object, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: He</b> breaks the oath while <b>having a lack of awareness of the oath and</b> is therefore <b>liable.</b> Rava replied: <b>On the contrary, he has a lack of awareness of the object</b> of the oath <b>and</b> should therefore be <b>exempt.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said: We see: If he refrains</b> from eating <b>due to the oath,</b> i.e., when he is reminded that he took an oath, <b>he had a lack of awareness of the oath and is liable. If he refrains due to the object</b> of the oath, i.e., when he is reminded what it is he is about to eat, <b>he had a lack of awareness due to the object, and is exempt.</b>",
    "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Doesn’t he refrain only from</b> breaking the <b>oath due to</b> his recognition of the <b>object? Doesn’t he refrain from</b> the <b>object due only to</b> the <b>oath?</b> In either case, he needs to remember both the oath and its object, and the manner in which he was reminded does not serve to indicate anything. <b>Rather, there is no difference</b> between the two.",
    "<b>Rava asked of Rav Naḥman:</b>"
