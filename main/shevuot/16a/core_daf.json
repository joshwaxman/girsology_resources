    "<b>Based on a ruling of a prophet</b> the loaves of one thanks-offering <b>were eaten, and based on a ruling of a prophet</b> the loaves of the other thanks-offering <b>were burned.</b> The prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who lived at the time of Ezra and Nehemiah’s reconsecration of Jerusalem, instructed the people concerning how the ceremony should be conducted, without providing reasons for the procedures.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: And with regard to <b>any</b> addition to the Temple <b>that was not made with all these</b> ceremonial procedures, one who enters there while ritually impure is not liable. <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the text of the mishna. <b>Rav Huna says: We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>With all these,</b> which means that all of these procedures are indispensable, and if even one is missing, the consecration does not take effect. <b>Rav Naḥman says: We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>With one of all these;</b> i.e., any one of these procedures suffices for the consecration to take effect.",
    "The Gemara further clarifies this disagreement. <b>Rav Huna says: We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>With all these.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He maintains</b> that <b>the initial consecration</b> of the Temple in the days of David and Solomon <b>sanctified</b> it <b>for its time and sanctified</b> it <b>forever.</b> Therefore, the site of the Temple retained its original sanctity even during the days of the Second Temple. <b>And Ezra,</b> who reconsecrated the area, <b>did</b> so <b>merely as a commemoration</b> of the initial consecration. Accordingly, even though there was no king or <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, the entire area was fully consecrated. By contrast, in order to consecrate an area that had not been part of the initial consecration, all of these procedures are necessary and none can be omitted.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman says: We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>With one of all these.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He maintains</b> that <b>the initial consecration</b> of the Temple <b>sanctified</b> it <b>for its time</b> only, <b>and did not sanctify</b> it <b>forever. And Ezra consecrated</b> the Temple and its courtyards, <b>even though there was no</b> king or <b><i>Urim VeTummim</i>.</b> Consequently, it follows that there is no need for all of these procedures in order for the consecration to take effect.",
    "<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman:</b> The mishna explicitly states: <b>Any</b> addition <b>that was not made with all these</b> procedures. Rav Naḥman said to him: Emend the mishna and <b>teach</b> it as stating: <b>With one of all these</b> procedures.",
    "The Gemara cites a proof against the opinion of Rav Naḥman: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Shaul says: There were two ponds [<i>bitzin</i>] on the Mount of Olives [<i>Har HaMishḥa</i>], a lower</b> pond <b>and an upper</b> pond. <b>The lower</b> pond <b>was consecrated</b> during the time of the First Temple <b>with all</b> the procedures mentioned in the mishna, and it has the sanctity of Jerusalem for all purposes. By contrast, <b>the upper</b> pond <b>was not consecrated with all these</b> procedures, <b>but</b> rather it was consecrated <b>by those who returned from the exile</b> in Babylonia, <b>without a king and without</b> the <b><i>Urim VeTummim</i>.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>the lower</b> pond, <b>whose consecration was complete, <i>amei ha’aretz</i>,</b> uneducated people who were not scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot relating to tithes and to ritual purity, <b>would enter into there and</b> would <b>partake of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> that may be eaten in all of Jerusalem <b>there, but</b> they would <b>not</b> partake of <b>second tithe</b> there because they conducted themselves stringently concerning this matter. <b>And <i>ḥaverim</i>,</b> who were meticulous in their observance of those mitzvot, <b>would partake of</b> both <b>offerings of lesser sanctity and second tithe there.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: As for <b>the upper</b> pond, <b>whose consecration was incomplete, <i>amei ha’aretz</i> would enter into there and partake of offerings of lesser sanctity there, but</b> they would <b>not</b> partake of <b>second tithe</b> there. <b>And <i>ḥaverim</i> would partake of neither offerings of lesser sanctity nor second tithe there. And for what</b> reason <b>did they not consecrate</b> the upper pond? It was <b>because additions can be made to the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or to the</b> Temple <b>courtyards only by</b> a special body comprising the <b>king, a prophet, the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, and the Sanhedrin of seventy-one, and with two thanks-offerings and with</b> a special <b>song.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But why did they consecrate</b> the upper pond if they could not do so properly? This Gemara responds: <b>Why did they consecrate it? Didn’t you say</b> that <b>they did not consecrate it? Rather,</b> the question should be asked as follows: Given that they could not consecrate the upper pond, <b>why did they bring it within</b> the walls of the city? The Gemara answers: <b>Because it was a weak point [<i>turpa</i>] of Jerusalem and it would have been easy to conquer</b> the city <b>from there,</b> it became necessary to include it within the wall. This <i>baraita</i> seems to present explicit proof against the opinion of Rav Naḥman, who holds that there is no need for all of the procedures listed in the mishna in order for the consecration to be complete.",
    "The Gemara rejects this proof: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> as to whether the initial consecration of Jerusalem and the Temple sanctified them only for their time or forever. Abba Shaul maintains that the initial consecration lapsed, and therefore the reconsecration required all of the procedures mentioned in the mishna. Where is this dispute taught? <b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:6): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: I heard</b> that <b>when they were building the Sanctuary</b> in the Second Temple, <b>they fashioned</b> temporary <b>curtains for the Sanctuary and</b> temporary <b>curtains for the courtyards</b> to serve as partitions until the construction of the stone walls was completed. The difference was <b>only that in the Sanctuary,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>outside</b> the curtains, without entering, <b>and in the courtyards,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>within</b> the curtains.",
    "The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: I heard that one sacrifices offerings</b> on the altar <b>even if there is no Temple,</b> and <b>one partakes of offerings of the most sacred order</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>even if there are no curtains, and</b> one partakes of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity and second-tithe</b> produce in Jerusalem <b>even if there is no wall</b> surrounding the city. This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the initial consecration sanctified</b> the Temple and Jerusalem <b>for their time and</b> also <b>sanctified</b> them <b>forever.</b> The Gemara concludes: From the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua based his opinion on the principle that the initial consecration sanctified the Temple and Jerusalem forever, can one <b>not</b> learn <b>by inference</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer maintains</b> that <b>it did not sanctify</b> them <b>forever?</b> Apparently, this issue is the subject of a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>.",
    "<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> do you draw this inference? <b>Perhaps everyone</b> maintains that <b>the initial consecration sanctified</b> the Temple and Jerusalem <b>for their time and</b> also <b>sanctified</b> them <b>forever. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>stated that</b> tradition, <b>which he heard</b> from his teachers, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>stated that</b> tradition, <b>which he heard</b> from his teachers, and there is no dispute between them. <b>And if you would say: Why do I</b> need <b>curtains</b> at all <b>according to Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The original sanctity remained when Jerusalem was not surrounded by walls, and similarly, the presence or absence of curtains is irrelevant to the sanctity of the Temple area. The Gemara answers: The curtains were established <b>merely for seclusion,</b> as it would have been unbecoming for the activity in this most sacred venue to be visible to all.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> this matter is subject to a dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the walled cities listed in the mishna in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> (32a): <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Why did the Sages enumerate</b> specifically <b>these</b> nine cities as cities that were walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun? In fact, there were many more. The reason is <b>that when the exiles ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia in the time of Ezra, <b>they found these</b> cities <b>and consecrated them</b> as walled cities; <b>but the</b> sanctity of the <b>first</b> walled cities, enumerated in the book of Joshua, <b>was nullified when</b> settlement in <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was negated</b> and the Jewish people were exiled. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>maintains: The initial consecration sanctified</b> the Temple and Jerusalem <b>for their time</b> only <b>and did not sanctify</b> them <b>forever.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: Were these</b> cities that are enumerated in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> <b>the only</b> walled cities? <b>But isn’t it already stated: “Sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, all these were cities fortified with high walls,</b> gates and bars” (Deuteronomy 3:4–5), indicating that there were many walled cities in the time of Joshua? <b>Rather, why</b> then <b>did the Sages enumerate</b> specifically <b>these</b> cities? It is due to the fact <b>that when the exiles ascended</b> from Babylonia <b>they found these and consecrated them</b> as walled cities.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>They consecrated them?</b> If their sanctity remained, it should not have been necessary to consecrate them. <b>Now, don’t we say later</b> in the same <i>baraita</i> <b>that it is not necessary to consecrate</b> them? The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather,</b> this is what the <i>baraita</i> means to say: When the exiles ascended from Babylonia <b>they found these and enumerated them.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And not only these, but</b> in <b>any</b> city with regard to <b>which you receive a tradition from your ancestors that it was surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun, all these mitzvot</b> with regard to walled cities <b>are observed in it, due to</b> the fact <b>that the initial consecration sanctified</b> the Temple and Jerusalem <b>for their time and sanctified</b> them <b>forever.</b> The Gemara comments: This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that there are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> who disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei.</b> Each transmitted Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion in a different manner. And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that one of the traditions is mistaken, as <b>one of the</b> <i>baraitot</i> <b>was stated by Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei,</b> and not his brother, Rabbi Yishmael. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei says</b> that the verse with regard to walled cities states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). The word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, meaning no, and accordingly the verse would be stating to the contrary, that the city does not have a wall, but its vocalization is in the sense of its homonym, <i>lo</i> with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even if it does not presently have</b> a wall <b>but it had</b> a wall <b>previously,</b> it retains its status as a walled city. It is Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei who maintains that the first consecration sanctified the Temple and Jerusalem forever."
