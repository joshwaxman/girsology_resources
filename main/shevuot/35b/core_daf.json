    "or <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is compassionate,</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is stating</b> the <i>halakha</i>. Although gracious and compassionate are not names of God, the reference in the mishna is to an oath in the name of God.",
    "<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If so,</b> in the case of one who administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in the</b> name of <b>heaven and in the</b> name of <b>earth as well,</b> say that it is with regard to an oath <b>in</b> the name of <b>He for Whom the heaven and the earth are His</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is stating</b> the <i>halakha</i>. Why, then, does the mishna say that for an oath in the name of heaven and in the name of earth, these witnesses are exempt from liability?",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, since there is no other entity that is called gracious and compassionate, certainly</b> it is <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is gracious,</b> and <b>certainly</b> it is <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is compassionate</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking.</b> By contrast, <b>here, since there are heaven and earth</b> that exist as independent entities, perhaps when he administers an oath in the name of heaven and in the name of earth, it is <b>in the</b> name of the actual <b>heaven and in the</b> name of the actual <b>earth</b> that <b>he is speaking,</b> and not in the name of He for Whom the heaven and the earth are His.",
    "§ Apropos the names of God that may be erased and those that may not be erased, the Gemara discusses the details of the matter. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one wrote</b> the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i> from</b> the name <b><i>Elohim</i>,</b> or <b><i>yod heh</i> from the Tetragrammaton, this</b> pair of letters and that pair of letters <b>may not be erased.</b> But if one wrote the letters <b><i>shin dalet</i> from <i>Shaddai</i>,</b> or <b><i>alef dalet</i> from <i>Adonai</i>,</b> or <b><i>tzadi beit</i> from <i>Tzevaot</i>, this may be erased.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The word <b><i>tzevaot</i> may be erased</b> in <b>its entirety, as</b> God <b>is called <i>Tzevaot</i> only in the context of</b> the children of <b>Israel,</b> and it is not an independent name of God, <b>as it is stated: “And I shall bring forth My hosts [<i>tzivotai</i>], My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 7:4). <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught: Any</b> letters <b>ancillary to the name</b> of God, <b>whether</b> as a prefix <b>preceding</b> the name <b>or</b> as a suffix <b>succeeding</b> the name, <b>this</b> addition <b>may be erased. Preceding it, how so?</b> If one wrote the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>lamed</i>,</b> meaning: To the Lord, the <b><i>lamed</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>beit</i>,</b> meaning: By the Lord, the <b><i>beit</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>vav</i>,</b> meaning: And the Lord, the <b><i>vav</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>mem</i>,</b> meaning: From the Lord, the <b><i>mem</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>shin</i>,</b> meaning: That the Lord, the <b><i>shin</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>heh</i>,</b> meaning: Is the Lord, the <b><i>heh</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>kaf</i>,</b> meaning: Like the Lord, the <b><i>kaf</i> may be erased.</b>",
    "<b>Succeeding it, how so?</b> If one wrote <b><i>Eloheinu</i>,</b> meaning: Our God, the <b><i>nun vav</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased; <i>Eloheihem</i>,</b> meaning: Their God, the <b><i>heh mem</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased; <i>Eloheikhem</i>,</b> meaning: Your God, second person plural, the <b><i>kaf mem</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased. <i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> The suffix <b>succeeding</b> the name of God <b>may not be erased as the name</b> of God to which it is appended <b>already sanctified it</b> and it is considered as though it is part of the name. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>.</b>",
    "§ <b>Abraham; who cursed Naboth; in Gibeah of Benjamin; Solomon; Daniel;</b> this is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the <i>halakhot</i> that follow.",
    "<b>All names</b> that could be understood as the name of God <b>that are stated in the Torah with regard to Abraham</b> are <b>sacred</b> and are referring to God, <b>except for this</b> name, <b>which is non-sacred, as it is stated: “My lords, if I have found favor in your eyes”</b> (Genesis 18:3). In that passage, Abraham is addressing the angels who appeared to him in the guise of men, not God.",
    "<b>Ḥanina, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i, say: This too</b> is <b>sacred.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Hospitality</b> accorded to <b>guests is greater than receiving the Divine Presence? In accordance with whose</b> opinion is that statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that pair</b> of <i>tanna’im</i>, Ḥanina, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who understood that Abraham was speaking to God.",
    "<b>All names</b> that could be understood as the name of God <b>that are stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to Lot</b> are <b>non-sacred</b> and are referring to angels, <b>except for this</b> one, <b>which is sacred, as it is stated: “And Lot said to them: Please, not so <i>Adonai</i>. Behold your servant has found favor in your eyes,</b> and you have magnified Your mercy that You have performed for me by saving my life” (Genesis 19:18–19). It is apparent from the context that Lot is addressing <b>He Who has the capacity to kill and to vivify; that is the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b>",
    "<b>All names that are stated with regard to Naboth</b> are <b>sacred,</b> e.g., in the verse: “Naboth blasphemed <i>Elohim</i> and the king” (I Kings 21:13), and those stated <b>with regard to Micah</b> are <b>non-sacred</b> and are referring to the graven image that he fashioned (see Judges, chapters 17–18). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Indeed, all names that are stated <b>with regard to Naboth</b> are <b>sacred;</b> but those stated <b>with regard to Micah, some of them are non-sacred and some of them are sacred.</b> The names beginning with the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i>,</b> i.e., <i>Elohim</i>, are <b>non-sacred,</b> as the reference is to the idol that he crafted, and all the names beginning with the letters <b><i>yod heh</i>,</b> i.e., the Tetragrammaton, are <b>sacred, except for this</b> name that begins with the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i> and it is sacred: “All the time that the house of <i>Elohim</i> was in Shiloh”</b> (Judges 18:31).",
    "<b>All names that are stated in</b> the passage concerning <b>Gibeah of Benjamin,</b> where the rest of the tribes consulted God to determine whether they should go to war against the tribe of Benjamin (see Judges, chapter 20), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> They are <b>non-sacred,</b> as they were consulting an idol, not God. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> They are <b>sacred.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: How can you say that those names are sacred? <b>Does</b> God <b>promise and not fulfill</b> the promise? Twice the tribes received the response to go to war against Benjamin, and twice they were vanquished.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>That which</b> God <b>promised, He fulfilled.</b> In each case, He responded to their question. The first time they consulted God through the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, <b>but they did not seek to ascertain if</b> they are <b>to triumph</b> in the war or <b>if</b> they are <b>to be defeated. In the last</b> time that they consulted God through the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, <b>where they sought to ascertain</b> whether they would emerge triumphant, <b>they consented</b> in Heaven <b>to their</b> endeavor, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas, son of Elazar, son of Aaron was standing before it in those days, saying: Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?</b> And the Lord said: Go up, as tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand” (Judges 20:28).",
    "<b>All</b> mentions of the name <b>Shlomo that are stated in the Song of Songs,</b> such as: “The song of songs that is Shlomo’s” (Song of Songs 1:1), are not references to King Solomon; rather, they are <b>sacred,</b> meaning <b>a song to</b> the <b>One for Whom peace [<i>shehashalom</i>] is His, except for this</b> mention: <b>“My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Solomon shall have the one thousand,”</b> i.e., one thousand are <b>for Solomon himself; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit”</b> (Song of Songs 8:12), which is a reference to <b>the Sages. And some say: This</b> verse <b>too is non-sacred: “Behold, the bed of Solomon; sixty</b> mighty men are around it” (Song of Songs 3:7).",
    "The Gemara asks: Does this mean: <b>This</b> verse <b>too</b> is non-sacred, <b>and it is not necessary</b> to say that the verse cited earlier is non-sacred? <b>But that which Shmuel says: A monarchy that kills one of</b> every <b>six</b> individuals <b>in the world is not punished</b> for doing so, as that is the prerogative of a monarch, <b>as it is stated: “My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Shlomo shall have the one thousand,”</b> this is a reference <b>to the monarchy of Heaven; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit,”</b> this is a reference <b>to the monarchy of earth.</b> Of the 1,200 mentioned in the two parts of the verse, two hundred, or one-sixth, are the prerogative of the earthly monarch. <b>Shmuel,</b> who interprets the mention of Shlomo in this verse as referring to God, holds <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i> nor in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced with the term: <b>Some say.</b> Both <i>tanna’im</i> agree that the reference in the verse is to Solomon and not to the Holy One, Blessed be He.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> Shmuel cites a different version of the opinion introduced with the term: Some say, according to which <b>this</b> is what <b>it is saying. And some say: This</b> Shlomo that appears in the verse with regard to the one thousand is <b>sacred, and that</b> Shlomo that appears in the verse <b>with regard to the bed of</b> Solomon <b>is non-sacred, and</b> it is <b>Shmuel who states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced with the term: <b>Some say.</b>",
    "<b>All kings that are stated with regard to Daniel</b> are <b>non-sacred, except for this</b> one, <b>which is sacred: “You, O king, king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven has given you the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory”</b> (Daniel 2:37).",
    "<b>And some say: This too</b> is <b>sacred, as it is stated: “My Lord, the dream shall be for your enemy and its interpretation for your foe”</b> (Daniel 4:16). <b>To whom is</b> Daniel <b>saying</b> this? <b>If it enters your mind</b> that when Daniel says: “My lord,” it is <b>to Nebuchadnezzar</b> that <b>he is saying it, his enemy, who are they?</b> They are the <b>Jewish people. Would</b> Daniel <b>curse the Jewish people?</b>",
    "<b>And the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who understands that Daniel is referring to Nebuchadnezzar, <b>holds: Are there Jewish enemies</b> for Nebuchadnezzar and <b>there are no gentile enemies</b> for him? Daniel was cursing the gentile enemies, not the Jewish enemies.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Or</b> if one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in</b> the name of <b>any of the appellations</b> of God, even though he did not mention the ineffable name of God, <b>these</b> witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony.",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that cites the verse: <b>“The Lord shall render you as a curse and as an oath”</b> (Numbers 5:21). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> at the beginning of the verse: <b>“And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing”? Due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And he heard the voice of an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), one may infer: <b><i>Ala</i> is stated here</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>and <i>ala</i> is stated there</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>; <b>just as there,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, the reference is to <b>an oath, so too here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, the reference is to <b>an oath.</b> And <b>just as there,</b> the oath is administered <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too here,</b> the oath is administered <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God. This is contrary to the mishna, where the ruling is that an oath of testimony may be administered even in the name of appellations of God.",
    "<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi,</b> and <b>that</b> mishna is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi says: Since the Torah says</b> in some cases: <b>Take an oath, and</b> in some cases: <b>Do not take an oath;</b> and it says in some cases: <b>Curse, and</b> in some cases: <b>Do not curse, just as</b> when the Torah says: <b>Take an oath,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too,</b> when the Torah states: <b>Do not take an oath,</b> it is <b>in the name</b> of God. And <b>just as</b> when the Torah states: <b>Curse,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too,</b> when the Torah says: <b>Do not curse,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> say: <b>If they derive</b> an oath of testimony from <i>sota</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy, let us require</b> that both an oath of testimony and the curse will be specifically in <b>the ineffable name</b> of God. <b>If they do not derive</b> an oath of testimony from <i>sota</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy, from where do they</b> derive <b>that</b> the instance of the word <b><i>ala</i> that</b> is written with regard to an oath of testimony <b>is an oath?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to an oath of testimony: “And he hears the voice of <b>an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1); <b><i>ala</i> is nothing other than an expression</b> meaning <b>oath. And likewise it says: “And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing [<i>ha’ala</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:21).",
    "The Gemara asks: It is not merely <i>ala</i> that is written there; <b>the oath of an <i>ala</i> is written there.</b> Apparently, <i>ala</i> alone does not mean oath. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> “And he hears the voice of <b>an <i>ala</i>”; <i>ala</i> is</b> used <b>only</b> when accompanied <b>by an oath. And likewise it says: “And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing.”</b>"
