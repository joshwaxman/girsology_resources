    "<b>And if you would say that one leavens the remainder</b> of the meal-offering, which the priests partake of, <b>and he consecrates</b> the Temple courtyard <b>with it,</b> that too is difficult, as <b>isn’t it written: “It shall not be baked leavened, for their portion</b> I have given it to them” (Leviticus 6:10)? <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> in explanation of this verse: <b>Even</b> the priests’ <b>portion shall not be baked leavened,</b> as it is prohibited to bake even a portion of the meal-offering leavened.",
    "The Gemara asks: Still, <b>why not</b> consecrate the Temple courtyard with a leavened meal-offering? <b>It is possible to consecrate</b> it <b>with the two loaves</b> of bread that are brought as a communal offering <b>on the</b> festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> which is a meal-offering that is leavened. The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> actually <b>it is not possible</b> to do so.",
    "The Gemara explains why not. <b>How could we do</b> it? If <b>we build</b> the addition to the Temple courtyard <b>on the eve</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>and</b> also <b>consecrate it on the eve</b> of the Festival, there is a difficulty, as <b>the two loaves become consecrated</b> as a meal-offering <b>with the slaughter of the</b> two <b>lambs</b> that are sacrificed together with them as peace-offerings, and this occurs on the Festival itself, not on the eve of the Festival.",
    "If <b>we build</b> the addition to the Temple courtyard <b>on the eve</b> of the <i>Shavuot</i> festival, <b>but consecrate it</b> only <b>now,</b> on the Festival, this too is difficult, as <b>we require consecration at the time of</b> the completion of <b>the building.</b>",
    "If <b>we build it on the Festival and consecrate it on the Festival,</b> this also cannot be, as <b>the building of the Temple does not override the Festival.</b>",
    "If <b>we leave</b> the two loaves <b>until after</b> the Festival <b>and build</b> the addition to the Temple courtyard on the day after the Festival, <b>and consecrate it</b> by eating the two loaves on that day, this is difficult as well, as the two loaves <b>were already disqualified by</b> virtue of being <b>left overnight</b> after the Festival.",
    "If <b>we build</b> the addition to the Temple courtyard <b>on the eve of the Festival and leave a little</b> unbuilt until after the Festival, and <b>as soon as the day is over</b> and the Festival is finished, <b>we immediately finish</b> building the addition <b>and consecrate it</b> with the two loaves before they become disqualified, this too is impossible, as <b>the building of the Temple cannot</b> take place <b>at night.</b> This is <b>as Abaye says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the building of the Temple cannot</b> take place <b>at night? As it is stated: “And on the day that the Tabernacle was erected”</b> (Numbers 9:15), from which it can be derived: One <b>may erect it during the day,</b> but one <b>may not erect it at night. Therefore, it is impossible</b> to consecrate the Temple courtyard with the two loaves; it must be done with the remainder of an unleavened meal-offering.",
    "§ The mishna teaches concerning the consecration of an addition to the city of Jerusalem or the Temple courtyard: <b>And with a song. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: They sang <b>the song of thanksgiving,</b> i.e., Psalms, chapter 100, which begins: “A psalm of thanksgiving,” accompanied <b>by harps, lyres, and cymbals, at every corner and upon every large stone in Jerusalem. And</b> they also <b>recited</b> Psalms, chapter 30, which begins: <b>“I will extol You, O Lord, for You have lifted me up,” and the song of evil spirits,</b> i.e., Psalms, chapter 91, which begins: “He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High.” <b>And some say</b> that this psalm is called <b>the song of plagues.</b>",
    "The reason of <b>the one who says</b> that it is called the song <b>of plagues</b> is <b>that it is written: “Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling”</b> (Psalms 91:10). <b>And</b> the reason of <b>the one who says</b> that it is called the song of <b>evil spirits</b> is <b>that it is written: “A thousand shall fall at your side</b> and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you” (Psalms 91:7).",
    "<b>And they recited</b> the psalm from the verse: <b>“He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shadow of the Almighty”</b> (Psalms 91:1), <b>until</b> they completed the verse: <b>“Because You, O Lord, are my refuge; You have made the most High Your habitation”</b> (Psalms 91:9). <b>And they would then recite</b> Psalms, chapter 3, which begins: <b>“A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Lord, how many are my enemies become,” until</b> they reached the verse: <b>“Salvation belongs to the Lord; Your blessing be upon Your people. Sela”</b> (Psalms 3:9), which is the end of that psalm.",
    "It is related that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would recite these verses</b> to protect him from evil spirits during the night <b>and fall asleep</b> while saying them. The Gemara asks: <b>How could he do that? But doesn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> himself <b>say: One is prohibited from healing himself with words of Torah?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>To protect</b> oneself <b>is different,</b> as he recited these verses only to protect himself from evil spirits, and not to heal himself.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>But rather, when</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said</b> that this <b>is prohibited,</b> he was referring to a situation <b>where there is</b> already <b>a wound</b> and one recites these verses in order to heal himself. But <b>if there is</b> already <b>a wound</b> and he recites these verses over it, is only this <b>prohibited, and nothing more? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 90a), that <b>one who whispers</b> an incantation <b>over a wound has no share in the World-to-Come?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The mishna was <b>taught with regard to one who spits</b> into the wound and then whispers these verses. And the reason for the severity of this action is <b>that the name of Heaven must not be mentioned in connection with spitting,</b> as doing so is a show of contempt for God.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that as part of the consecration ceremony, <b>the court</b> would <b>move</b> forward, <b>and two thanks-offerings</b> would be brought <b>after them,</b> and all of the Jewish people would follow behind them. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that the</b> members of the <b>court walk in front of the thanks-offering? But isn’t it written</b> in the verse from which this ceremony is derived: “And I placed two large thanks-offerings, and we went in procession to the right upon the wall, toward the dung gate; <b>and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah”</b> (Nehemiah 12:31–32)? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: The court moves</b> forward. <b>And</b> how is this done? <b>The two thanks-offerings move</b> forward, <b>and the court</b> follows <b>after them.</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies this point: <b>How</b> exactly did the two thanks-offerings <b>move</b> forward? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, disagree about this. <b>One</b> Sage <b>says: One</b> thanks-offering <b>alongside the other. And one</b> Sage <b>says: One behind the other.</b> According to <b>the one who says</b> that the two offerings moved <b>one alongside the other,</b> the thanks-offering that the mishna refers to as <b>the inner one</b> is <b>that which is closest to the wall.</b> According to <b>the one who says</b> that the two offerings moved <b>one behind the other,</b> the thanks-offering that is called <b>the inner one</b> is <b>that which is closest to</b> the members of <b>the court</b> advancing behind the thanks-offerings.",
    "The Gemara analyzes these two opinions: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: When they would reach the end of the place that they desired to consecrate, <b>the inner</b> thanks-offering would <b>be eaten and the outer one</b> would <b>be burned. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the two thanks-offerings moved forward <b>one behind the other,</b> and that the inner one is the one that was in the rear, it is <b>due to this</b> that <b>the inner one is eaten, because the outer one came before it and consecrated</b> the additional area, so that it is now a sanctified place fit for the eating of the thanks-offering loaves. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the two thanks-offerings moved forward <b>one alongside the other, the two of them together consecrated</b> the additional area. Why, then, is the inner one eaten and the outer one burned?",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to your reasoning, according to the one who says</b> that the two offerings moved forward <b>one behind the other, does one</b> offering by itself <b>consecrate</b> the area? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that with regard to <b>any</b> addition <b>that was not made with all these</b> ceremonial procedures, the addition is not consecrated? <b>And even according to the one who says</b> (see 16a) that the correct reading of the mishna is: With regard to any addition that was not made <b>with</b> any <b>one of all these</b> ceremonial procedures, the addition is not consecrated, nevertheless, <b>these two</b> thanks-offerings <b>are one mitzva,</b> and one without the other would not consecrate the area.",
    "<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b>"
