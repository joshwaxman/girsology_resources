    "the flesh of <b>an ox that is stoned, a heifer whose neck is broken,the birds</b> sacrificed by <b>a leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:4–7), <b>a firstborn donkey</b> whose neck was broken, <b>and meat</b> cooked together <b>with milk are all</b> susceptible to <b>the ritual impurity of food,</b> despite the fact that they are forbidden for consumption.",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon says: None of them are susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> since they are all items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, and they are therefore not considered food. <b>And Rabbi Shimon concedes with regard to meat</b> cooked together <b>with milk that it is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food since it,</b> i.e., both the meat and the milk, <b>had a time</b> that it was <b>fit</b> for consumption before it was rendered forbidden.",
    "<b>And Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s</b> opinion that an item from which it is prohibited to derive benefit is not susceptible to impurity of food? It is because it is stated: <b>“All food which may be eaten [<i>ha’okhel asher ye’akhel</i>],</b> that on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The redundancy in the phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that specifically <b>food that you are able to feed to others,</b> in this case, gentiles, <b>is termed food</b> for the purposes of susceptibility to the impurity of food, but <b>food that you are not able to feed to others is not termed food.</b> Therefore, items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit and which it is therefore prohibited to feed to others are not considered food in this context.",
    "Rabbi Oshaya explains how this can be applied to <i>piggul</i>: <b>A meal offering</b> that one <b>rendered <i>piggul</i> is also food that you are not able to feed to others,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from it. Consequently, it is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food according to Rabbi Shimon.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why doesn’t he <b>also</b> derive that <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk</b> is susceptible to impurity <b>because it is food that you may feed to others,</b> as Rabbi Shimon maintains that it is permitted to derive benefit from meat and milk cooked together?",
    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> With regard to <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, eating</b> it <b>is prohibited and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, as it is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And elsewhere</b> the verse <b>states: “And you shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an animal torn by animals, which is forbidden as a <i>tereifa</i>, i.e., an animal possessing a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, <b>eating</b> it <b>is prohibited but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted, so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, where being a holy people is also mentioned, <b>eating</b> it <b>is forbidden but</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is permitted.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> that cites Rabbi Shimon’s opinion <b>states one</b> reason why meat cooked in milk is susceptible to impurity <b>and</b> adds <b>another. One</b> reason is <b>that</b> it <b>is food that you can feed to others.</b> Therefore, it is called food for the purpose of being susceptible to impurity. <b>And another</b> reason is that <b>even for him,</b> i.e., a Jew, although it is currently prohibited to eat the milk and meat, <b>it had a time</b> when each was <b>fit</b> to be eaten, i.e., before they were cooked together; therefore, they remain susceptible to impurity.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Oshaya from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>there is</b> a case of the <b>leftover</b> of an offering <b>that is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, but there is</b> also a case of the <b>leftover</b> of an offering <b>that is not susceptible to the impurity of food.</b>",
    "<b>How so?</b> If it was <b>left overnight before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood on the altar, it is not susceptible <b>to the ritual impurity of food,</b> as it never became fit for consumption. But if it was left overnight <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> since from after the sprinkling of the blood until it was left overnight, it was fit for consumption.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> with regard to <b><i>piggul</i>, both in</b> cases of <b>offerings of the most sacred order as well as in</b> cases of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> the meat of the offering is not susceptible to <b>the impurity of food.</b> This is because it was rendered forbidden for consumption at the beginning of the sacrificial rite, and was never fit for consumption. If the priest <b>rendered a meal offering <i>piggul</i>,</b> it <b>is</b> susceptible to <b>the impurity of food,</b> since it did have a period of time when it was acceptable, i.e., when it was still flour before it was consecrated as a meal offering. This ruling contradicts Rabbi Oshaya’s understanding that according to Rabbi Shimon, a meal offering that became <i>piggul</i> is not susceptible to the impurity of food.",
    "The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> where Rabbi Shimon ruled that the meal offering that became <i>piggul</i> is susceptible to the impurity of food, it is referring to a case <b>where it had a time</b> in which <b>it</b> was <b>fit</b> for consumption. <b>There,</b> where it is not susceptible to the impurity of food, it is referring to a case <b>where it did not have a time</b> in which it was <b>fit</b> for consumption.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances where it did not have a time</b> in which it was <b>fit</b> for consumption? Before the flour was consecrated as a meal offering, it was certainly permitted for consumption. The Gemara answers: This would occur <b>where he consecrated</b> the wheat <b>while</b> it was still <b>attached</b> to the ground and was therefore not yet susceptible to impurity. Once harvested, it was already prohibited for consumption.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: The flour may still have a time in which it was fit. <b>Let him redeem it</b> before it is placed in a service vessel. Why is it regarded as not having a time in which it was fit for consumption? The Gemara qualifies the question: <b>This</b> distinction, between flour that came from wheat that was consecrated before it was harvested and wheat or flour that was consecrated at a later point, <b>works out well according to this version of</b> that which <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: Impure</b> meal offerings and libations that have not been consecrated in a service vessel <b>are redeemed;</b> if they are <b>pure,</b> they <b>are not redeemed.</b> Accordingly, it works out <b>well</b> that the flour does not have a time in which it was fit for consumption when it came from wheat that was consecrated before being harvested. It could not be redeemed and made fit for consumption.",
    "<b>But according to this version of</b> what Rabbi Oshaya <b>said: Even pure</b> meal offerings and libations <b>are redeemed,</b> there remains the possibility of <b>letting him redeem</b> the meal offering while it is pure and before is consecrated in a service vessel. Therefore, it should be considered as having a time in which it is fit for consumption.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>In any event, now he has not redeemed it.</b> Therefore, it is not considered to have had a time in which it is fit for consumption.",
    "The Gemara asks: How can the flour be considered as not having a time in which it is fit for consumption merely because he has not redeemed it, even though he could have redeemed it? <b>Since</b> in a case <b>where if</b> he <b>wants,</b> he <b>may redeem it,</b> don’t <b>we attribute to Rabbi Shimon that he said</b> that for <b>any</b> item <b>that stands to be redeemed,</b> it <b>is as if it</b> already <b>is redeemed?</b>",
    "The Gemara cites a source for this assertion: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> A red <b>heifer,</b> even if it has been slaughtered and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, since it had a time in which it was fit. And Reish Lakish said,</b> explaining how it is possible to derive from this <i>halakha</i> that any item that could be redeemed is considered as though it has been redeemed: <b>Rabbi Shimon would say</b> that a red <b>heifer is redeemed</b> with money even when it has already been slaughtered and placed <b>upon its pyre</b> in preparation for being burned. If so, a meal offering that could be redeemed should also be considered fit for consumption, as it is considered as though it has been redeemed.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted,</b> with regard to the red <b>heifer,</b> it <b>is</b> considered to be an item that <b>stands to be redeemed, since if he found another</b> animal <b>choicer than it,</b> there is <b>a mitzva to redeem</b> the first one and purchase the choicer one with the money. <b>But</b> is there <b>a mitzva to redeem these meal offerings?</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> there is a case where sacrificial meat <b>remained</b> overnight <b>before the sprinkling</b> of the blood occurred, <b>where there was a mitzva to sprinkle</b> the blood the day before, <b>and if he had wanted</b> he <b>could have sprinkled</b> it, and the offering would not have been disqualified. <b>And</b> yet, Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> sacrificial meat that remained overnight <b>is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> even though it should have been considered fit for consumption on the day the offering was slaughtered, as the blood stood to be sprinkled and there was a mitzva to sprinkle it.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where there was not</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day to sprinkle</b> the blood, as the offering was slaughtered close to sunset. Therefore, the blood did not stand to be sprinkled and the meat was therefore never fit for consumption.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in a case where the offering was slaughtered when <b>there was</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood, <b>what</b> would then be the <i>halakha</i> according to Rabbi Shimon? Would meat left overnight <b>be susceptible to the ritual impurity of food?</b>",
    "If so, <b>rather than</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>teaching</b> the following: Sacrificial meat that was left overnight before the blood was sprinkled is not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, but if <b>left overnight after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food,</b> instead <b>let him distinguish within</b> the case <b>itself: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> When is sacrificial meat left overnight without the blood of the offering having been sprinkled not susceptible to the ritual impurity of food? It is in a case <b>where there was not</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood; but if <b>there was</b> sufficient <b>time remaining in the day</b> to sprinkle the blood, it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>That is indeed what he is saying</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, that if the offering was <b>left overnight before</b> it was <b>available for sprinkling,</b> i.e., if it was slaughtered so late in the day that there was no time left to sprinkle the blood, it is not susceptible <b>to the ritual impurity of food.</b> By contrast, if it was left overnight <b>after</b> it was <b>available for sprinkling,</b> i.e., there was still time to sprinkle the blood, then it <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: Does Rabbi Shimon in fact hold that an item that stands to be redeemed is treated as though it has already been redeemed, and is therefore considered to have had a time in which it is fit, even if it was never actually redeemed? <b>But isn’t</b> it so that when one <b>renders either offerings of the most sacred order or offerings of lesser sanctity <i>piggul</i>,</b> there was <b>a mitzva to sprinkle</b> the blood once the offering was slaughtered,"
