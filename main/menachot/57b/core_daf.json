    "<b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>fruit juices do not leaven</b> dough. <b>Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili would say:</b> Even though the oil of <b>the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations</b> is plentiful, sometimes one might also <b>knead</b> a meal offering <b>with</b> some <b>water,</b> if he considers it necessary to add it, <b>and</b> it is <b>fit.</b> If so, it is possible for this meal offering to leaven due to the water, and therefore the verse: “That you shall bring,” teaches that the prohibition against leavening also applies to this type of meal offering.",
    "The Gemara asks: With regard to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, the vessel into which a tenth of an ephah of flour for baking the <b>shewbread is</b> placed in <b>is a measuring</b> vessel for <b>dry</b> items, <b>and we have heard that Rabbi Akiva said:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items were <b>not consecrated</b> as service vessels. This means the shewbread becomes consecrated only when it is placed on the Table in the Sanctuary, after it has been baked. If so, at this stage, the prohibition against leavening is not relevant.",
    "In answer to this question, the Gemara states that <b>Rabbi Reuven sent</b> a letter from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, in which he cited a statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: This is the</b> correct <b>version [<i>hetze’ah</i>] of</b> this <b><i>baraita</i>, and</b> one should <b>reverse</b> the names of the Sages in it: The phrase <b>“that you shall bring”</b> serves <b>to include the shewbread in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include the meal offering</b> brought with <b>libations in</b> the prohibition against <b>leavening.</b> Consequently, there is no contradiction between Rabbi Akiva’s statement here and his statement with regard to measuring vessels for dry items.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili is the one who maintains that the measuring vessels for dry items were consecrated, <b>follows [<i>ve’azda</i>] his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> stated elsewhere. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and one of the students of Rabbi Yishmael</b> both <b>said the same thing. And who is</b> that student of Rabbi Yishmael? It is <b>Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>",
    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the consecration of the Tabernacle and its vessels before their inauguration: “And it came to pass on the day that Moses had made an end of setting up the Tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, and all its vessels, and the altar and all its vessels, <b>and had anointed them and sanctified them”</b> (Numbers 7:1). <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items, e.g., oil, and wine for libations, were <b>anointed</b> and thereby consecrated <b>both on</b> the <b>inside and on</b> the <b>outside.</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items, such as the flour for meal offerings, <b>were anointed</b> and consecrated only <b>on</b> the <b>inside, but were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items <b>were anointed on</b> the <b>inside and were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside,</b> whereas the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>were not anointed at all.</b> Rabbi Yonatan cites a proof for his opinion: <b>You can know</b> that the measuring vessels for dry items were not consecrated at all, <b>because</b> it is taught that these vessels <b>do not consecrate</b> items placed inside them. <b>As it is written: “You shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth-parts of a ephah. They shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven, for first produce to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:17). <b>When</b> are <b>they</b> considered consecrated <b>to the Lord?</b> Only <b>after they are baked</b> with leaven. This demonstrates that when the flour is placed into the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel the meal offering is not yet consecrated.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the interpretation of the word “them” in the phrase: “And sanctified <b>them”</b> (Numbers 7:1). Both <i>tanna’im</i> agree that the term “them” serves to exclude something from the anointing and consecration, but they disagree over what is excluded. <b>Rabbi Yoshiya maintains</b> that <b>“them”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the consecration of the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items on the <b>outside,</b> i.e., only the inside of the vessels is consecrated. <b>And Rabbi Yonatan maintains</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>are non-sacred,</b> i.e., not consecrated at all, <b>and</b> therefore <b>it is not necessary</b> for the <b>verse to exclude</b> them. <b>Where it was necessary</b> for the <b>verse to exclude</b> something, it was with regard to <b>measuring</b> vessels used for <b>liquid</b> items, to teach that they are consecrated only on the inside but not <b>on</b> the <b>outside.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: Since the dispute between Rabbi Yoshiya and Rabbi Yonatan concerns the <i>halakha</i> of measuring vessels for dry items, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say also,</b> as he did with regard to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Yoshiya: <b>Rabbi Akiva and one of the students of Rabbi Yishmael</b> both <b>said the same thing, and who is</b> that student? <b>Rabbi Yonatan.</b> The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say this <b>due to</b> the fact that their opinions <b>are not the same with regard to measuring</b> vessels used for <b>liquid</b> items: Rabbi Akiva maintains that these vessels are consecrated both on the inside and on the outside, whereas Rabbi Yonatan rules that they are consecrated only on the inside.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> How can it be suggested, according to the opinion that the measuring vessels for dry items were not consecrated, that the shewbread is consecrated only when it is placed on the Table? <b>But</b> before that <b>there is</b> the stage in which the dough is placed into the <b>receptacle [<i>bisa</i>]</b> in which it is kneaded. Since this vessel <b>is</b> used for <b>liquid</b> items, the dough should be consecrated at that point. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: This is referring to a case <b>where he kneaded</b> the dough <b>on top of</b> a flat <b>leather spread [<i>katavliyya</i>],</b> which does not sanctify the dough.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>that which Rabbi Yonatan said to</b> Rabbi Yoshiya as proof of his opinion, that <b>you can know</b> that it is so, <b>as</b> it is taught that these vessels <b>do not consecrate</b> items placed inside them, <b>let</b> Rabbi Yoshiya <b>say to him</b> in refutation of his claim: This is referring to a case <b>where he measured</b> the flour for the two loaves <b>in</b> a vessel used for measuring <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, but it was a vessel <b>that</b> was <b>non-sacred,</b> and it is for this reason that the loaves are not consecrated.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted,</b> one can say that the shewbread was kneaded on a leather spread rather than in <b>a receptacle,</b> as <b>the Merciful One does not write</b> in the Torah <b>that one should</b> specifically <b>use a receptacle to knead</b> the shewbread. Therefore, <b>when one kneads</b> the dough of a meal offering <b>on top of a leather spread, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. But</b> in the case of the two loaves whose flour was measured in a vessel used for measuring <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>since the Merciful One states</b> explicitly to <b>use</b> a vessel of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and measure with it,</b> can it be suggested that the one preparing the meal offering should <b>leave aside</b> the <b>consecrated</b> vessel for <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and measure with a non-sacred</b> vessel for <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah?",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one who offers up</b> outside the Temple courtyard a portion <b>of the meat of a sin offering, or</b> a portion <b>of the meat of a guilt offering, or</b> a portion <b>of the meat of offerings of the most sacred order, or</b> a portion <b>of the meat of offerings of lesser sanctity, or</b> a portion <b>of the surplus of the <i>omer</i> offering, or</b> a portion <b>of the leftover of the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering on <i>Shavuot</i> of two loaves from the new wheat, <b>or the shewbread, or the remainder of meal offerings, that</b> in all these cases <b>he</b> violates <b>a prohibition,</b> although these items are not meant to be sacrificed on the altar?",
    "The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states: “For any leaven, and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 2:11). The extra term “of it” teaches that <b>any</b> item <b>that</b> has already had some part <b>of it</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire</b> on the altar <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not burn,</b> stated in that verse explicitly with regard to honey and leaven.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the two loaves and the shewbread, is there</b> some part <b>of them</b> burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A portion of every offering is sacrificed on the altar, <b>except for the two loaves and the shewbread, as no</b> part <b>of them</b> is burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> Although <b>no</b> part <b>of</b> the two loaves or the shewbread <b>themselves</b> is burned <b>in</b> the <b>fire,</b> nevertheless, they are included in the prohibition against offering them up to the altar, since they are not viewed as independent entities but rather as parts of larger offerings. The two loaves accompany the sheep sacrificed as burnt offerings on Shavuot, and are permitted for consumption only once those sheep have been burned on the altar. Similarly, the shewbread is permitted for consumption only after the bowls of frankincense that were on the Table with it have been burned on the altar.",
    "§ The Gemara discusses the prohibition against offering up on the altar parts of offerings after their sacrificial portions have already been burned. <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who brings up</b> any part <b>of any of</b> the items listed in the <i>baraita</i> <b>onto the ramp</b> leading to the altar, but not to the altar itself, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable</b> and <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>",
    "The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: After the verse: “As any leaven and any honey, you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord,” the next verse states: “As an offering of first fruits you may bring them to the Lord, but they shall not come up to <b>the altar</b> for a pleasing aroma” (Leviticus 2:12). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to an item that is brought on the <b>altar. From where</b> is it derived that the same applies if it is brought to the <b>ramp</b> of the altar? <b>The verse states: “But they shall not come up to the altar</b> for a pleasing aroma,” to be accepted, and the ramp is the means to ascend to the altar.",
    "<b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that one who brings up parts to the ramp is <b>exempt? As the verse states:</b> “For any <b>leaven, and</b> any <b>honey,</b> you shall not burn any of it as an offering made by fire to the Lord. <b>As an offering of first produce you may bring them</b> to the Lord, but they shall not come up to the altar for a pleasing aroma” (Leviticus 2:11–12).",
    "The Gemara explains: The term <b>“them”</b> indicates that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to those offerings that come from leaven or honey and which are called: “An offering of first produce.” This category consists of first fruits, which are brought from dates and other sweet fruit and which are called: “The choicest first fruits of your land” (Exodus 23:19), and the two loaves, which are leaven and are the first meal offerings brought from the new crop each year. In other words, it is with regard to <b>this</b> category <b>that</b> the verse <b>amplifies for you</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>ramp</b> of the altar is considered <b>like</b> the <b>altar</b> itself. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>other items,</b> e.g., the meat of sin offerings and guilt offerings, the ramp of the altar is <b>not</b> treated like the altar itself."
