    "<b>And</b> one was for the value of <b>the lambs</b> brought as a nazirite’s or a leper’s guilt offering. <b>And</b> one was for the value of <b>the goats</b> brought as communal sin offerings on Festivals. <b>And</b> one was for <b>the surplus</b> coins of one who designated money to purchase one of those offerings and had money left over after purchasing the animal. <b>And</b> one was for <b>the</b> additional silver <b><i>ma’a</i></b> paid as a premium in a case when two people brought their half-shekel jointly as one shekel.",
    "After citing these four opinions, the Gemara explains: <b>All of</b> the other Sages <b>do not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Ḥizkiyya</b> that the six collection horns are to prevent quarrels between the families of priests, <b>as</b> they hold that <b>we are not concerned about quarreling</b> between the priests. There is no reason for them to fight, <b>as each and every</b> family <b>serves on its</b> own <b>day</b> and receives the hides of the animals sacrificed on that day.",
    "The other Sages <b>do not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the six horns are to prevent the coins from decaying, as <b>we are not concerned that</b> the coins will <b>decay.</b>",
    "The other Sages <b>do not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Ze’eiri</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, because <b>we do not interpret</b> a mishna <b>in accordance with an individual</b> opinion against the majority opinion.",
    "The other Sages <b>also do not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>bar Padda</b> that the six collection horns were for the value of bulls, rams, lambs, and goats that had been lost, for the surplus coins left over after purchasing an offering, and for the <i>ma’a</i> paid as a premium in addition to the half-shekel of two people. This is because they hold that there is no reason to differentiate between <b>the surplus</b> and the value of specific animals, as <b>all of</b> the animals that were lost and another offered in their place are <b>also surplus,</b> and their value is surplus after the replacement offering was purchased.",
    "The other Sages <b>also</b> do not agree with bar Padda’s explanation that the sixth collection horn was for the <b><i>ma’a</i>,</b> because they hold that the <i>ma’a</i> <b>goes toward</b> the same purpose as the regular <b>shekels, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>ma’a</i>: <b>Where would this premium [<i>kalbon</i>] go,</b> i.e., what was done with it? It would be added <b>to the shekels</b> themselves, which would be used to buy the daily and additional offerings; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It would be used <b>for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings.",
    "The Gemara cites two additional explanations for the purpose of the six collection horns. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> These six horns <b>correspond to</b> the surplus coins left over after purchasing six offerings, namely: The <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a sin offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a guilt offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a nazirite’s guilt offering,</b> brought if he comes into contact with a corpse during his term of naziriteship; <b>and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a leper’s guilt offering,</b> brought as part of his purification process; <b>and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a meal offering of a sinner;</b> and the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering sacrificed <b>by the High Priest</b> each day, half in the morning and half in the evening.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Oshaya says</b> that there is a different explanation for the six collection horns: They <b>correspond to</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a sin offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a guilt offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a nazirite’s guilt offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a leper’s guilt offering; and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after the purchase of <b>pairs</b> of doves or pigeons by women after childbirth, by <i>zavim</i> as part of their purification process, and others; <b>and</b> the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a meal offering of a sinner.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Shmuel does not say in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> that one of the collection horns was for the surplus coins left over after purchasing pairs of birds? The Gemara answers: A collection horn for coins for <b>pairs</b> of birds is already <b>taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna in tractate <i>Shekalim</i> (18a), among the list of seven collection horns that served purposes other than the communal gift offerings.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Oshaya teach</b> the mishna <b>without teaching</b> that one of the collection horns was for <b>pairs</b> of birds? Does he have a different version of the mishna? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Oshaya teach</b> the mishna explicitly, <b>teaching</b> in his version of the mishna that there was a collection horn for <b>pairs</b> of birds? The Gemara answers that <b>one</b> of the collection horns was for coins designated <b>for</b> purchasing <b>pairs</b> of birds, <b>and one</b> collection horn was <b>for the surplus</b> coins remaining after purchasing <b>pairs</b> of birds.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya does not say in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>he holds like the one who says</b> that the <b>surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest</b> are not used to purchase other offerings but are left to <b>rot; as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the meal offering of</b> are used for the purchase of a communal <b>gift</b> offering. <b>The surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>a meal offering</b> are left to <b>rot.</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies the opaque wording: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: The surplus</b> coins left over from the purchase of <b>a meal offering of a sinner</b> are used for the purchase of a communal <b>gift</b> offering. <b>The surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest</b> are left to <b>rot.</b>",
    "<b>Rabba</b> offered an alternative interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> and <b>said: Even the surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest</b> are <b>also</b> used for the purchase of a communal <b>gift</b> offering. <b>Rather, the surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the loaves</b> accompanying <b>a thanks offering</b> are left <b>to rot.</b>",
    "The Gemara points out that the opinions of Rav Ḥisda and Rabba correspond to opinions raised <b>in the dispute</b> among earlier <i>amora’im</i>, as with regard to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest, Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that they are used to buy a communal <b>gift</b> offering, while <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that they must be left <b>to rot.</b>",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 6b): <b>The surplus</b> coins that had been designated for <b>shekels are non-sacred</b> property; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> meal offering, <b>and the surplus</b> money that had been designated to purchase offerings that are brought due to ritual impurity or a sin, such as <b>the pairs</b> of birds <b>of <i>zavim</i>, the pairs</b> of birds <b>of <i>zavot</i>, the pairs</b> of birds <b>of women after childbirth, and sin offerings, and guilt offerings,</b> in these cases, <b>the surplus</b> coins must be used for a communal <b>gift</b> offering.",
    "The Gemara explains the objection: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: The tenth of an ephah meal offering? <b>Is it not</b> referring to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the High Priest’s tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>the surplus</b> coins left over after purchasing <b>the meal offering of a sinner,</b> which is also brought from a tenth of an ephah of fine flour (Leviticus 5:11).",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Yitzḥak said: It is reasonable</b> to accept the opinion of <b>the one who said: The surplus</b> coins left over from purchasing <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest</b> are left to <b>rot.</b>",
    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to a sinner’s meal offering: The verse states: “But if his means are not sufficient for two doves or two pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; <b>he shall put no oil upon it, nor shall he put any frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 5:11). <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that the phrase “it is a sin offering” is interpreted as a restriction: <b>It is called a sin offering, and no other</b> meal offering <b>is called a sin offering.</b> This <b>taught that with regard to the tenth of an ephah</b> griddle-cake meal offering <b>of the High Priest, it is not called a sin offering, and</b> consequently it <b>requires frankincense.</b>",
    "Rav Naḥman inferred: <b>And since it is not called a sin offering, its surplus</b> coins should not be used to buy communal gift offerings like the surplus coins of sin offerings; rather, they should be left to <b>rot.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to one who said: <b>This bull is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and</b> subsequently <b>it became blemished [<i>venista’ev</i>]</b> and was disqualified from sacrifice, he should redeem the bull and with that money purchase another bull as an offering in its stead. <b>If he wishes, he may bring two</b> bulls <b>with its</b> redemption <b>money</b> instead of one. If one says: <b>These two bulls are</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and</b> subsequently <b>they became blemished,</b> if <b>he wishes he may bring one</b> bull <b>with their</b> redemption <b>money. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> this <b>prohibited,</b> and holds that he must bring two bulls.",
    "In a case where one said: <b>This ram is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished, if he wishes he may bring a lamb with its</b> redemption <b>money.</b> In a case where one said: <b>This lamb is</b> hereby <b>a burnt offering, and it became blemished, if he wishes he may bring a ram with its</b> redemption <b>money. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for one to bring one type of animal with redemption money from another type of animal."
