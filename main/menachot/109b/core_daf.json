    "as by slaughtering the idolatrous offering intentionally <b>he became a servant of idol worship.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman said: From where do I say</b> that even a priest who intentionally slaughters an idolatrous offering is nevertheless fit to serve in the Temple if he repents? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a priest who served</b> in <b>idol worship and repented, his offering</b> in the Temple <b>is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord and is acceptable.",
    "Rav Naḥman clarifies: <b>In what</b> manner did he serve in idol worship? <b>If we say</b> that he served in idol worship <b>unwittingly, what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>And repented? He is already repentant,</b> as he never intended to sin in the first place. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>of intentional</b> idol worship. <b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to sprinkling</b> the blood of an idolatrous offering, <b>when he repents, what of it? Hasn’t he performed</b> idolatrous <b>service,</b> thereby disqualifying himself from serving in the Temple in any event? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of an idolatrous offering? Evidently, even if the priest slaughtered it intentionally, once he repents he is fit to serve in the Temple.",
    "<b>And</b> as for <b>Rav Sheshet, he</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to unwitting</b> slaughter. <b>And this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If</b> the priest <b>is repentant from the outset, as when he served</b> in idol worship <b>he served unwittingly,</b> then <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord and is acceptable. <b>But if not,</b> i.e., he slaughtered an idolatrous offering intentionally, <b>his</b> subsequent <b>offering</b> in the Temple is <b>not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.",
    "§ The Gemara lists other similar disagreements between Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet. In a case where a priest <b>bowed to</b> an object of <b>idol worship, Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he subsequently repents and serves in the Temple, <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. In a case where a priest <b>acknowledges</b> an object of <b>idol worship</b> as a divinity, <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If he subsequently repents and serves in the Temple, <b>his offering is an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: His offering is not an aroma pleasing</b> to the Lord.",
    "Having listed four similar disputes between Rav Naḥman and Rav Sheshet, namely, with regard to a priest who unwittingly sprinkled the blood of an idolatrous offering, a priest who intentionally slaughtered an idolatrous offering, a priest who bowed to an idol, and a priest who acknowledged an idol as a divinity, the Gemara explains: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> to teach the dispute with regard to all four cases. <b>As, had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> case, where a priest sprinkles the blood of an idolatrous offering unwittingly, one might have thought that only <b>in that</b> case <b>Rav Sheshet says</b> that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified, <b>because he performed a service for</b> idolatry that is considered a sacrificial rite in the Temple. <b>But</b> in a case where the priest merely performed <b>slaughter, since he did not perform a service for</b> idolatry that is a sacrificial rite in the Temple, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet <b>concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman.</b>",
    "<b>And had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only the dispute with regard to a priest intentionally performing <b>slaughter</b> for an idolatrous offering, one might have thought that Rav Sheshet says that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified <b>because he performed</b> a sacrificial <b>rite for</b> idolatry. <b>But</b> if he merely <b>bowed</b> to the idol, <b>since he did not perform</b> a sacrificial <b>rite for</b> idolatry, there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet does <b>not</b> disqualify the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well.",
    "<b>And had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only the case of a priest <b>bowing</b> to an idol, one might have thought that in this case Rav Sheshet says that the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple is disqualified <b>because he performed an action for</b> idolatry. <b>But</b> if he only <b>acknowledged</b> the idol as a divinity, <b>which is mere speech,</b> there is room to <b>say</b> that Rav Sheshet does <b>not</b> disqualify the priest’s subsequent service in the Temple. The Gemara concludes: Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this case as well.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And needless to say,</b> if priests served for <b>something else,</b> a euphemism for idolatry, they are disqualified from service in the Temple. The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it says: Needless to say,</b> if they served for <b>something else, by inference, the temple of Onias is not</b> a temple of <b>idol worship,</b> but rather a temple devoted to the worship of God.",
    "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>like the one who says</b> that <b>the temple of Onias is not</b> a temple of <b>idol worship. As it is taught:</b> During <b>the year in which Shimon HaTzaddik died, he said to</b> his associates: <b>This year, he will die,</b> euphemistically referring to himself. <b>They said to him: From where do you know?</b>",
    "Shimon HaTzaddik <b>said to them:</b> In previous years, <b>every Yom Kippur,</b> upon entering the Holy of Holies, I had a prophetic vision in which <b>I would be met by an old man</b> who was <b>dressed in white, and</b> his head was <b>wrapped in white, and he would enter</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with me, and he would leave with me.</b> But <b>this year, I was met by an old man</b> who was <b>dressed in black, and</b> his head was <b>wrapped in black, and he entered</b> the Holy of Holies <b>with me, but he did not leave with me.</b> Shimon HaTzaddik understood this to be a sign that his death was impending.",
    "Indeed, <b>after the pilgrimage festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>he was ill for seven days and died. And his fellow priests refrained from reciting the</b> Priestly <b>Benediction with the</b> ineffable <b>name</b> of God.",
    "<b>At the time of his death, he said to</b> the Sages: <b>Onias, my son, will serve</b> as High Priest <b>in my stead. Shimi,</b> Onias’ <b>brother, became jealous</b> of him, <b>as</b> Shimi <b>was two and a half years older than</b> Onias. Shimi <b>said to</b> Onias treacherously: <b>Come and I will teach you the order of the service</b> of the High Priest. Shimi <b>dressed</b> Onias <b>in a tunic [<i>be’unkeli</i>] and girded him with a ribbon [<i>betziltzul</i>]</b> as a belt, i.e., not in the vestments of the High Priest, and <b>stood him next to the altar.</b> Shimi <b>said to his fellow priests: Look what this</b> man <b>vowed and fulfilled for his beloved,</b> that he had said to her: <b>On the day that I serve in the High Priesthood I will wear your tunic and gird your ribbon.</b>",
    "<b>The fellow priests of</b> Onias <b>wanted to kill him</b> because he had disgraced the Temple service with his garments. Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them and they ran after him. He went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of idol worship. When the Sages heard of the matter they said: If this</b> person, Shimi, <b>who did not enter</b> the position of High Priest, acted with <b>such</b> jealousy, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>one who enters</b> a prestigious position rebel if that position is taken away from him. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the temple of Onias was built for idol worship.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him:</b> The <b>incident was not like this. Rather, Onias did not accept</b> the position of High Priest <b>because his brother Shimi was two and a half years older than him,</b> so Shimi was appointed as High Priest. <b>And even so,</b> even though Onias himself offered the position to Shimi, <b>Onias was jealous of his brother Shimi.</b> Onias <b>said to</b> Shimi: <b>Come and I will teach you the order of the service</b> of the High Priest. <b>And</b> Onias <b>dressed</b> Shimi <b>in a tunic and girded him in a ribbon and stood him next to the altar.</b> Onias <b>said to his fellow priests: Look what this</b> man, Shimi, <b>vowed and fulfilled for his beloved,</b> that he had said to her: <b>On the day that I serve in the High Priesthood I will wear your tunic and gird your ribbon.</b>",
    "<b>His fellow priests wanted to kill</b> Shimi. Shimi then <b>told them the entire incident,</b> that he had been tricked by his brother Onias, so the priests <b>wanted to kill Onias.</b> Onias <b>ran</b> away <b>from them, and they ran after him.</b> Onias <b>ran to the palace of the king, and they ran after him. Anyone who saw him would say: This is him, this is him,</b> and he was not able to escape unnoticed. Onias <b>went to Alexandria in Egypt and built an altar there, and sacrificed</b> offerings <b>upon it for the sake of Heaven. As it is stated: “In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at its border, to the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 19:19). According to Rabbi Yehuda, the temple of Onias was dedicated to the worship of God.",
    "<b>And when the Sages heard of the matter they said: If this one,</b> Onias, <b>who fled from</b> the position of High Priest and offered it to his brother, still was overcome with <b>such</b> jealousy to the point where he tried to have Shimi killed, <b>all the more so</b> will <b>one who wants to enter</b> a prestigious position be jealous of the one who already has that position.",
    "§ As a corollary to the statement of the Sages with regard to one who is jealous and wants the position of another, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Peraḥya said: Initially,</b> in response to <b>anyone who would say</b> to me: <b>Ascend to</b> the position of <i>Nasi</i>, <b>I would tie him up and place him in front of a lion</b> out of anger for his suggestion. <b>Now</b> that I have become the <i>Nasi</i>, in response to <b>anyone who tells me to leave</b> the position, <b>I</b> would <b>throw a kettle [<i>kumkum</i>] of boiling</b> water <b>at him</b> out of anger at his suggestion.",
    "It is human nature that after one ascends to a prestigious position he does not wish to lose it. <b>As</b> evidence of this principle, <b>Saul</b> initially <b>fled from</b> the kingship, as he did not wish to be king, as stated in the verse: “When they sought him he could not be found…Behold he has hidden himself among the baggage” (I Samuel 10:21–22). <b>But when he ascended</b> to the kingship <b>he tried to kill David,</b> who he thought was trying to usurp his authority (see I Samuel, chapters 18–27).",
    "§ <b>Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Abaye: What does Rabbi Meir do with this verse of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Since Rabbi Meir holds that the temple of Onias was dedicated to idol worship, how does he explain the verse in Isaiah?",
    "Abaye answered Mar Kashisha and said that Rabbi Meir uses this verse <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>After the downfall of Sennacherib,</b> the king of Assyria who besieged Jerusalem (see II Kings, chapters 18–19), King <b>Hezekiah emerged</b> from Jerusalem <b>and found the</b> gentile <b>princes</b> Sennacherib had brought with him from his other conquests, <b>sitting in carriages [<i>bikronot</i>] of gold. He made them vow that they would not worship idols,</b> and they fulfilled their vow, <b>as it is stated</b> in Isaiah’s prophecy about Egypt: <b>“In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan</b>"
