    "<b>How much</b> wine is used for the <b>libations of a ewe? And I resolved</b> this question <b>from</b> that which is stated in <b>a mishna</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 14b): Generally, the wine for libations would be procured from the supplies of the Temple. One bringing an offering would pay the Temple treasurer for the quantity of wine required, and then the treasurer would give him a token as a receipt indicating what had been paid for. The individual would then proceed to the official appointed over the Temple’s supplies to collect the wine he had paid for. If the token had the word: <b>Kid,</b> it could be <b>used</b> to collect wine for <b>libations for sheep,</b> whether <b>large or small, male or female, except for those of rams.</b> Evidently, the same quantity is required for the libations of ewes as for lambs.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For <b>all communal offerings there is no</b> mitzva of <b>placing hands</b> on the head of the offering, <b>except for the bull that comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of <b>any</b> one <b>of the mitzvot</b> that was perpetrated due to an erroneous ruling of the Sanhedrin, where the judges of the Sanhedrin are required to place their hands upon its head (see Leviticus 4:13–21); <b>and the scapegoat</b> brought on Yom Kippur, upon which the High Priest places his hands (see Leviticus, chapter 16). <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Also</b> in the case of the <b>goat</b> that comes to atone for a community-wide perpetration of <b>idol worship</b> that occurred due to an erroneous ruling of the Sanhedrin, the judges of the Sanhedrin are required to place their hands upon its head (see Numbers 15:22–26).",
    "<b>All offerings of an individual require placing hands, except for the firstborn</b> offering, <b>the</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offering, <b>and the Paschal offering.</b>",
    "The mitzva of placing hands is performed by the owner of the offering. The mishna adds: <b>And</b> if the owner died, then <b>the heir</b> is regarded as the offering’s owner and so he <b>places</b> his <b>hands</b> on the offering <b>and brings</b> the accompanying <b>libations. And</b> furthermore, <b>he can substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for it. Although it is prohibited to perform an act of substitution, if the owner of an offering does this, his attempt is successful to the extent that the non-sacred animal is thereby consecrated, even though the original offering also remains sacred.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: For <b>all communal offerings there is no</b> mitzva of <b>placing hands, except for the bull that comes</b> to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of <b>any</b> one <b>of the mitzvot, and</b> the <b>goats</b> that come to atone <b>for</b> a community-wide violation of the prohibition <b>of idol worship;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Yehuda says: There is no</b> mitzva of <b>placing hands</b> with regard to the <b>goats</b> that come to atone <b>for idol worship. But</b> if this is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>which</b> offering <b>shall I bring in their place? The scapegoat.</b>",
    "The Gemara interrupts the citation of the <i>baraita</i> with a question: Why does Rabbi Yehuda search for an additional case? Is it <b>not possible not to insert</b> an additional case? <b>Ravina said:</b> It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that there are <b>two</b> instances in which <b>placing hands</b> is required <b>for communal</b> offerings.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: How can you include the scapegoat as one of the two cases requiring the placing of hands? <b>Isn’t it</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>placing hands</b> can be performed <b>only by</b> the offering’s <b>owner,</b> i.e., the one who will achieve atonement through the sacrifice of the offering? <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> offering, the scapegoat, it is <b>Aaron</b> the High Priest <b>or</b> whichever of <b>his sons</b> serves as High Priest who <b>places</b> his <b>hands on it,</b> and yet it is not he who achieves atonement through it. Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> offering <b>as well,</b> that <i>halakha</i> is fulfilled because <b>Aaron and his sons</b> are considered owners, as they also <b>achieve atonement through it</b> together with the rest of the community.",
    "The Gemara elaborates on the dispute. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: And</b> Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Yehuda, who disagree as to whether the High Priest achieves atonement through the scapegoat, each <b>follow</b> their standard line of <b>reasoning.</b>",
    "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: At the end of the passage delineating the Yom Kippur Temple service, the verse states: “He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred, and upon the Tent of Meeting and the altar he shall effect atonement; and upon the priests and upon all the people, shall he bring atonement” (Leviticus 16:33). <b>“He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies. <b>“And upon the Tent of Meeting”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanctuary.</b> “And the <b>altar”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning. “He shall effect atonement”; this</b> is referring to the Temple <b>courtyards.</b> “And upon the <b>priests”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning.</b> “And <b>upon all the people”; these are the Israelites. “Shall he bring atonement”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Levites.</b>",
    "<b>All of them are equated with regard to</b> the fact that they are all atoned for through <b>one atonement,</b> i.e., <b>that they are atoned for by the scapegoat</b> for all transgressions other than the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atones for Israelites for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too,</b> the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. And <b>just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites for other transgressions, so too,</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests for other transgressions.</b> It is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> that it is only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda that the scapegoat atones for both Israelites and priests, and consequently the High Priest may be considered an owner with regard to the mitzva of placing hands.",
    "The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Shimon’s opinion: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon,</b> one can ask: <b>Weren’t</b> both Israelites and priests <b>certainly equated</b> in the verse in Leviticus? In what way are they equated in the verse? The Gemara explains: Yes, according to his opinion <b>they are equated</b> in <b>that they are all subject to atonement</b> on Yom Kippur, <b>but each one</b> of the groups <b>achieves atonement in its own</b> way. The priests achieve atonement through the bull brought by the High Priest and his confession, while the Israelites and Levites achieve atonement through the confession over the scapegoat.",
    "The Gemara summarizes: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> for the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>Israelites achieve atonemment through</b> the presentation of the <b>blood of the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>and</b> the <b>priests</b> achieve atonemment <b>through</b> the presentation of the blood of the <b>bull of Aaron,</b> i.e., of the High Priest. And <b>for other transgressions,</b> both <b>these</b> Israelites <b>and those</b> priests <b>achieve atonement through</b> the <b>confession</b> made over the <b>scapegoat. But according to Rabbi Shimon, for other transgressions as well,</b> the <b>priests achieve atonement through</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull</b> of the High Priest.",
    "This understanding of their dispute is just <b>like that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 2b): <b>Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, achieve atonement from the scapegoat equally. <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest?</b> It is <b>only that the bull</b> of the High Priest that he offers on Yom Kippur <b>atones for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for defiling caused by them through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat, whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests.</b> And for all other transgressions, <b>just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests.</b>",
    "§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon disagree as to whether or not the goats that come for a community-wide violation of the prohibition against idol worship require the rite of placing hands. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the bull that comes to atone for a community-wide violation of one of the mitzvot: <b>“And the elders of the congregation shall place their hands upon the head of the bull before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 4:15). The verse specifies that this requirement applies to the bull to indicate that, with regard to offerings brought for community-wide transgressions, only the <b>bull requires placing hands, but</b> the <b>goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require placing hands;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Both offerings require placing hands. The verse specifies the requirement with regard to the <b>bull</b> because only it <b>requires</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by Elders</b> of the Sanhedrin, <b>but</b> the <b>goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by the Elders,</b> but <b>rather by Aaron,</b> i.e., the High Priest.",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the Yom Kippur scapegoat, the verse states: “And Aaron shall place both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins” (Leviticus 16:21). The emphasis of <b>“the live</b> goat” indicates that with regard to communal offerings of goats, only <b>the live</b> goat, i.e., the scapegoat, <b>requires placing hands, but the goats</b> brought <b>for idol worship do not require placing hands;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> Both offerings require placing hands. The verse specifies the requirement with regard to the <b>live</b> goat to teach that it <b>requires</b> that <b>placing hands</b> be performed <b>by Aaron,</b> i.e., the High Priest,"
