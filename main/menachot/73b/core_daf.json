    "<b>Peace offerings</b> volunteered by <b>gentiles</b> are sacrificed as <b>burnt offerings,</b> which are burned completely upon the altar. With regard to the source for this <i>halakha</i>, <b>if you wish, cite a verse; and if you wish, propose a logical argument. If you wish, propose a logical argument:</b> Concerning <b>a gentile</b> who volunteers an offering, the intent of <b>his heart is</b> that the offering should be entirely sacred <b>to Heaven,</b> and he does not intend for any of it to be eaten.",
    "<b>And if you wish, cite a verse:</b> “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>] who is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, <b>which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 22:18). The doubled term <i>ish ish</i> teaches that the offerings of a gentile are accepted, and the verse thereby teaches that <b>any</b> offering <b>that</b> gentiles volunteer to be <b>sacrificed should be a burnt offering.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a gentile who volunteered to bring a peace offering,</b> if he <b>gave it to an Israelite,</b> the <b>Israelite eats it;</b> if he <b>gave it to a priest, the priest eats it.</b> Evidently, the gentile’s peace offering is eaten, like the peace offering of a Jew.",
    "To answer the challenge to Rav Huna’s statement, <b>Rava said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If a gentile volunteered a peace offering <b>in order to achieve atonement</b> on behalf of <b>an Israelite</b> who is already obligated to bring a peace offering, then <b>the Israelite eats</b> of the offering. If the gentile volunteered it <b>in order to achieve atonement</b> on behalf of <b>a priest</b> who is already obligated to bring a peace offering, then <b>the priest eats</b> of the offering. By contrast, Rav Huna’s statement teaches that when a gentile volunteers his own peace offering, it is treated as a burnt offering.",
    "<b>Rav Sheizevi raises an objection</b> from the mishna: <b>These are the meal offerings</b> from which <b>a handful is removed and their remainder</b> is eaten <b>by the priests…the meal offering of gentiles.</b> If the priests may eat the remainder of the meal offerings of gentiles, it is logical that the peace offerings of gentiles should also be given to the priests to eat, as the right of the priests to eat from meal offerings and peace offerings is identical. To resolve this objection, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement in the mishna that the priests eat the meal offerings of gentiles is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> and <b>that</b> ruling of Rav Huna that the peace offerings of gentiles are not eaten is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>",
    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse cited previously states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>] who is of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that brings his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering.” The verse is now analyzed: The verse could have stated: <b>A man [<i>ish</i>]. Why</b> does <b>the verse state</b> the double expression <b>“<i>ish ish</i>”?</b> This serves <b>to include the gentiles,</b> demonstrating <b>that they can vow</b> to bring <b>vow offerings and gift offerings like a Jew</b> can.",
    "When the verse states: <b>“Which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a gentile can vow to bring <b>a burnt offering. From where</b> is it derived that a gentile can vow to bring <b>a peace offering? The verse states: “Their vows.” From where</b> is it derived that he can bring <b>a thanks offering? The verse states</b> the seemingly superfluous clause: <b>“Their gift offerings.”</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the verse means <b>to include</b> that a gentile can bring <b>birds</b> as burnt offerings, <b>and wine</b> libations, <b>and the frankincense, and the wood</b> for the arrangement upon the altar? <b>The verse states</b> not only: <b>“Their vows,”</b> but also the more comprehensive term: <b>“Any of their vows”;</b> and the verse states not only: <b>“Their gift offerings,”</b> but also the more comprehensive term: <b>“Any of their gift offerings.”</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “They will offer to the Lord as <b>a burnt offering”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: This teaches that a gentile can bring a standard <b>burnt offering,</b> to <b>the exclusion of</b> a burnt offering of <b>naziriteship.</b> Since a gentile is unable to assume the status of a nazirite, he is also unable to bring the offerings of a nazirite. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“Which they will offer to the Lord as a burnt offering,”</b> it indicates that <b>nothing other than a burnt offering alone</b> may be brought by a gentile.",
    "With regard to the analysis of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the Gemara asks: <b>And this exclusion of</b> a burnt offering of <b>naziriteship,</b> is it <b>derived from here,</b> in the verse cited? Is it not <b>derived from there: “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: When a man…shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite”</b> (Numbers 6:2); this is interpreted to mean that <b>the children of Israel</b> can <b>vow</b> to become nazirites, <b>but the gentiles cannot vow</b> to become nazirites? Therefore, the exclusion of gentiles from bringing the burnt offering of a nazirite is not learned from the term “a burnt offering.”",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the exclusion was derived <b>from there,</b> i.e., the verse in Leviticus, which is referring to offerings, <b>I would say:</b>It <b>is the offering</b> of nazirites <b>that</b> the gentiles <b>cannot bring, but naziriteship takes effect upon them</b> if they vow to become a nazirite. Therefore, the exclusion of naziriteship by the verse in Numbers <b>teaches us</b> that a gentile cannot become a nazirite at all.",
    "§ The Gemara discusses a related matter. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 7:6): <b>Rabbi Shimon said: The court instituted seven ordinances</b> with regard to the financial aspects of offerings and consecrations. <b>And this</b> ordinance, namely, that the cost of the libations accompanying the sacrifice of a found sacrificial animal is borne by the public, <b>is one of them.</b> These are the other ordinances: If <b>a gentile sent his burnt offering from a country overseas,</b> and <b>he sent with it</b> money for the purchase of the <b>libations</b> that must accompany it, the libations <b>are offered at his</b> expense. <b>And if</b> the gentile did <b>not</b> cover the cost of the libations, it is a condition of the court that the libations are <b>sacrificed at the public’s</b> expense, with funds taken from the Temple treasury. Evidently, a gentile can offer libations as well as burnt offerings.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this mishna rules in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara rejects this assumption: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that this mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and he holds that a gentile can bring <b>a burnt offering and all its accessories,</b> including the libations.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to libations: “All who are <b>home born</b> shall do these things after this manner” (Numbers 15:13), which teaches that those who are <b>home born,</b> i.e., Jews, can <b>bring libations</b> as a separate offering, <b>but a gentile cannot bring</b> such <b>libations.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that a gentile’s <b>burnt offering should not require</b> the standard accompanying <b>libations.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “So</b> it shall be done for one bull” (Numbers 15:11), which indicates that every offering requires libations. <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>not</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and not</b> that of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains the question: <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, doesn’t he say</b> that a gentile may <b>even</b> bring <b>wine</b> by itself, and not only as a libation? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, doesn’t he say</b> that with regard to <b>a burnt offering, yes,</b> a gentile may bring it, but with regard to <b>something else</b> other than the offering itself, <b>no,</b> a gentile may not bring it?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili; and if you wish, say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. If you wish, say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> and <b>omit from that</b> <i>baraita</i> that the <i>tanna</i> allows gentiles to bring <b>wine,</b> as he holds that gentiles cannot bring wine by itself. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and interpret his opinion to be that a gentile may bring <b>a burnt offering and all its accessories.</b>",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests,</b> a handful is removed, and the entire offering is sacrificed upon the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived?",
    "The Gemara answers: It is derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states with regard to the meal offering of a sinner: “And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial of it, and burn it on the altar…it is a sin offering. And the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin that he has sinned in any of these matters, and he shall be forgiven; and the remainder shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering” (Leviticus 5:12–13). Since the phrase <b>“And</b> the remainder <b>shall be the priest’s, as the meal offering”</b> is seemingly unnecessary, as these verses are discussing a meal offering, it therefore teaches <b>that its</b> sacrificial <b>rite would be valid</b> even when performed <b>by</b> a priest who has brought the offering for his own sin.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> discusses the matter: <b>Do you say that</b> this verse teaches that <b>the rite</b> of the meal offering of a sinner <b>would be valid</b> when performed <b>by him? Or is it only</b> necessary <b>to permit</b> the eating of the remainder of the <b>meal offering of a sinner</b> brought <b>by</b> one of the <b>priests. And</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse that states: <b>“And every meal offering of the priest shall be offered in its entirety; it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 6:16)? Perhaps that is referring to <b>his voluntary meal offering, but his obligatory</b> meal offering <b>may be eaten.</b>",
    "Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And it shall be the priest’s as the meal offering.”</b> In this way, the verse <b>compares</b> the priest’s <b>obligatory</b> offering <b>to his voluntary</b> offering: <b>Just as his voluntary</b> offering <b>is not eaten, so too, his obligatory</b> offering <b>is not eaten.</b> In disagreeing with the previous interpretation, <b>Rabbi Shimon said: Is it stated: And it shall be the priest’s, as his meal offering? But it states only: “As the meal offering,”</b> referring to the meal offering of a non-priest. <b>Rather,</b> this verse serves <b>to compare</b> and render the <i>halakha</i> of"
