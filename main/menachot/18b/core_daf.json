    "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (103b): One who volunteers to bring a meal offering of sixty-one tenths of an ephah of flour must bring a meal offering of sixty tenths of an ephah in one vessel and a meal offering of a tenth of an ephah in a second vessel, because <b>sixty</b> tenths of an ephah of flour <b>can be</b> properly <b>mixed</b> with a <i>log</i> of oil but <b>sixty-one</b> tenths <b>cannot be</b> properly <b>mixed</b> with the oil. <b>And we discussed it</b> and asked: Even <b>if</b> sixty-one tenths of an ephah <b>do not mix</b> with one <i>log</i> of oil, <b>what of it? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna here that although there is a mitzva to mix the oil into the meal offering, if <b>one did not mix</b> the oil into it, the meal offering is still <b>fit?</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Zeira said</b> the following explanation: For <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing does not invalidate</b> the meal offering. Even though there is a mitzva to mix the oil and the flour <i>ab initio</i>, the meal offering is fit for sacrifice even if the oil and the flour are not mixed. <b>And</b> for <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>not suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing invalidates</b> the meal offering. This discussion demonstrates that when the mishna here says that the oil was not mixed into the meal offering, it means that it was not mixed at all. Therefore, the mishna’s statement that the meal offering is fit even if the oil was not poured should be understood as referring to a case where the oil was never poured, and not, as the Gemara inferred, as referring to a case where a non-priest poured it.",
    "The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b> When the mishna states: If one <b>did not pour</b> the oil onto the meal offering, it is referring to a case where <b>a priest did not pour</b> oil onto the meal offering <b>but a non-priest</b> did pour it. When it states: If one <b>did not mix</b> the oil into the meal offering, it means <b>he did not mix</b> the oil <b>at all.</b>",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Or</b> if it happened <b>that</b> the priest <b>broke</b> the meal offerings that require breaking into <b>greater pieces [<i>pittim merubbot</i>]</b> than appropriate, the meal offering is <b>fit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that it has already been stated in the mishna that if one <b>did not break</b> the loaves into pieces <b>at all</b> the meal offering is <b>fit, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that if one broke the meal offering into <b>greater pieces</b> than appropriate the meal offering is fit? The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the expression <b><i>pittin merubbot</i></b> mean? It means <b>that he increased [<i>ribba</i>]</b> the amount of the meal offering’s <b>pieces</b> by breaking the loaves into many pieces that were each smaller than an olive-bulk.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna is <b>actually</b> referring <b>literally</b> to <b>large pieces [<i>pittim merubbot</i>], and</b> it was necessary to teach this explicitly, <b>lest you say</b> that the meal offering <b>is</b> fit <b>there,</b> when the loaves are not broken, <b>since they have the status of loaves, but here, when</b> the loaves are broken into excessively large pieces and <b>no</b> longer <b>have the status of loaves,</b> as they have been broken up, <b>but</b> still <b>do not have the status of pieces,</b> as they are not the correct size, the offering is not fit. Therefore, it is necessary for the mishna to <b>teach us</b> this <i>halakha</i> explicitly.",
    "§ Based on the Gemara’s earlier inference that when the mishna states that the meal offering is valid even if the priest did not pour the oil it is referring to a case where a non-priest did perform this action, the Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any priest who does not admit to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites has no portion in</b> the gifts of <b>the priesthood. As it is stated: “He among the sons of Aaron, that offers the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion”</b> (Leviticus 7:33). This teaches that one who <b>admits to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites</b> and accepts responsibility for them <b>has a portion in the priestly</b> gifts, but one <b>who does not admit to</b> the validity of <b>the</b> sacrificial <b>rites does not have a portion in the priestly</b> gifts.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a priest does not have a share in the priestly gifts if he does not admit to the validity of <b>these</b> rites of the presenting of the blood or the burning of the fats <b>alone,</b> which are the sacrificial rites of a slaughtered offering, as those rites are enumerated in the verse. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> also <b>includes</b> one who does not admit to the validity of the <b>fifteen</b> sacrificial <b>rites</b> performed by the priests?",
    "The <i>baraita</i> clarifies: These are the rites of a meal offering, i.e., <b>the pouring</b> of oil, <b>the mixing, the breaking, the salting, the waving, the bringing</b> of the offering to the altar, <b>the removal of the handful, and the burning</b> of the handful on the altar. <b>And</b> it includes other rites as well: <b>The pinching</b> of the nape of the neck of a bird offering, <b>and the receiving</b> of the blood in a vessel, <b>and the sprinkling</b> of the blood, <b>and the giving of water to a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>], and the</b> ritual of <b>breaking a heifer’s neck, and the purification of a leper, and lifting of the hands</b> for the Priestly Benediction, <b>whether inside or outside</b> the Temple. <b>From where</b> is it derived that this <i>halakha</i> also includes one who does not admit to the validity of these rites?",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The verse states: “Among the sons of Aaron,”</b> teaching that with regard to any sacrificial <b>rite that is entrusted to the sons of Aaron, any priest who does not admit to its</b> validity <b>does not have a portion in the priestly</b> gifts. Since the pouring of the oil is included in the list of sacrificial rites entrusted to the priests, according to Rabbi Shimon the offering should not be fit if this service was performed by a non-priest.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Shimon is referring to <b>the meal offering of priests,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> in the mishna, the context is <b>a meal offering of an Israelite.</b> In the case of <b>a meal offering of an Israelite, which is</b> one that <b>requires the removal of a handful</b> to be burned on the altar, a verse teaches that <b>from</b> the stage of <b>the removal of the handful onward,</b> the rites performed with the meal offering are solely <b>the mitzva of</b> the members of the <b>priesthood.</b> Therefore, this verse also <b>teaches that</b> the <b>pouring</b> of the oil <b>and</b> the <b>mixing,</b> rites performed before the removal of the handful, <b>are valid</b> even if they are performed <b>by a non-priest.</b> By contrast, <b>the meal offering of priests, which is</b> one that <b>does not require the removal of a handful,</b> as the entire meal offering is burned on the altar, <b>requires</b> that <b>from the outset</b> the rites must be performed by a member of the <b>priesthood;</b> otherwise it is unfit.",
    "<b>Rava said to him: After all,</b> in the case of <b>the meal offering of priests, from where</b> was it <b>included</b> that there is an obligation <b>to pour</b> the oil? It is derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the meal offering of an Israelite,</b> where this <i>halakha</i> is stated explicitly. Therefore, <b>just as there</b> the rite is <b>valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest, so too here,</b> the rite is <b>also valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest.</b>",
    "<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> the discussion took place as follows: <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> when the mishna teaches that a meal offering is fit if the oil was poured by a non-priest, it is referring to meal offerings <b>from which a handful is removed,</b> whereas <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that lists the pouring of the oil as one of the rites performed by the priests, it is referring to meal offerings <b>from which a handful is not removed.</b>",
    "<b>Rava said to him: After all,</b> in the case of meal offerings <b>from which a handful is not removed, from where was it included</b> that there is also an obligation <b>to pour</b> the oil? It is derived <b>from</b> meal offerings <b>from which a handful is removed,</b> where this <i>halakha</i> is stated explicitly. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to meal offerings from which a handful is not removed <b>is like</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to those <b>from which a handful is removed; just as there,</b> the rite is <b>valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest, so too here,</b> the rite is <b>also valid</b> when performed <b>by a non-priest. Rather,</b> since Rava deflected Rav Naḥman’s explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Shimon in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the offering is fit even if the oil was poured by a non-priest? <b>The verse states: “And he shall pour oil upon it and put frankincense upon it. And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests; and he shall remove</b> his handful” (Leviticus 2:1–2). From here it is derived that <b>from the removal of the handful onward,</b> the rites of the meal offering are solely <b>the mitzva</b> of the members <b>of the priesthood.</b> Therefore, this verse also <b>teaches</b> that the <b>pouring</b> of the oil <b>and</b> the <b>mixing,</b> rites performed before the removal of the handful, <b>are valid</b> even if they are performed <b>by a non-priest.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what would <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> say in response? He would say that when it states: <b>“Aaron’s sons,</b>"
