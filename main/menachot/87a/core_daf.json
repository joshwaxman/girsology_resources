    "<b>the flour-</b>like white scum that floats on the surface, <b>nor from</b> the wine at <b>bottom of</b> the cask <b>due to the sediment</b> that collects there. <b>Rather, one brings from</b> the wine in <b>its middle third.</b>",
    "<b>How does</b> the Temple treasurer <b>inspect</b> the wine to determine that it is from the middle of the cask? <b>The treasurer sits</b> alongside the cask <b>and</b> has <b>the</b> measuring <b>reed in his hand.</b> The spigot is opened and the wine begins to flow. When he sees that the wine emerging <b>draws</b> with it <b>chalk</b>-like scum <b>[<i>hagir</i>], he</b> immediately <b>knocks with the reed</b> to indicate that the spigot should be closed.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> Wine <b>in which there is flour-</b>like white scum is <b>unfit</b> for libations, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to animal offerings: <b>“Unblemished they shall be for you…and their meal offering</b> shall be fine flour mixed with <b>oil…unblemished they shall be for you, and their libations”</b> (Numbers 28:19–20, 31). This indicates that animal offerings, meal offerings, and libations must all be brought from flawless products. Therefore, the presence of flour-like white scum in wine renders it unfit.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> libations from <b>sweet</b> wine, <b>nor</b> from <b>boiled</b> wine, <b>nor</b> from wine produced from <b>smoked</b> grapes, <b>and if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine, it is <b>not valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the first clause teach: One may not bring libations from sweet wine made from sun-dried grapes, but if one did bring</b> a libation from such wine it is <b>valid?</b> How can one clause teach that a libation of one type of sweet wine is valid, and the other clause teach that a libation of another type of sweet wine is not valid?",
    "<b>Ravina said:</b> The text of the mishna is corrupt. To correct it, <b>combine</b> the two clauses into one <b>and teach</b> with regard to all the wines mentioned that they are unfit to be used for libations. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The text of the mishna is correct. The reason for the difference between the two wines is that <b>the sweetness</b> of grapes sweetended <b>by the sun is not objectionable,</b> so libations of wine made from such grapes are valid, while <b>sweetness</b> that results from the sugars <b>of the fruit</b> itself <b>is objectionable,</b> so libations of wine made from such grapes are not valid.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> wine <b>aged</b> for one year; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but the Rabbis deem it valid.</b> The Gemara provides the source for Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling. <b>Rabbi Ḥizkiyya said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the libations that accompany the New Moon offering: “And their libations: Half a <i>hin</i> for a bull, a third of a <i>hin</i> for a ram, and a quarter of a <i>hin</i> <b>for a lamb, of wine”</b> (Numbers 28:14). The juxtaposition of the terms lamb and wine teaches that <b>just as a lamb</b> is fit to be used as an offering only if brought <b>in its</b> first <b>year, so too wine</b> is fit to be used as a libation only if it is <b>in its</b> first <b>year.</b>",
    "The Gemara ask: <b>If</b> so, take the analogy further and conclude that <b>just as</b> if one offers <b>a lamb in</b> its <b>second year,</b> it is <b>not valid, so too</b> a libation of <b>wine in</b> its <b>second year</b> is <b>not valid. And if you would say</b> that this is <b>indeed</b> the <i>halakha</i>, that is difficult: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>wine in</b> its <b>second year may not be brought</b> <i>ab initio</i>, but <b>if one did bring it</b> as a libation, it is <b>valid?</b> That <i>baraita</i> certainly expresses the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as <b>whom did you hear who said</b> that aged wine <b>may not be brought?</b> Only <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who explicitly states this opinion in the mishna. <b>And yet he says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one did bring</b> a libation of aged wine, it is <b>valid.</b> According to Rabbi Ḥizkiyya’s explanation of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, such an opinion is illogical.",
    "<b>Rather, Rava said: This is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse exhorting a person not to be enticed by fine wines: <b>“Look not upon the wine when it is red”</b> (Proverbs 23:31). Evidently, the redness of wine is indicative of its quality. After a year, wine begins to lose its redness and so it should not be used, <i>ab initio</i>. Nevertheless, it is still of a sufficient quality to be acceptable, after the fact.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may not bring</b> wine produced from <b>grapes suspended</b> on stakes or trees; rather, one brings wine produced from grapes at foot height and from vineyards that are cultivated. The definition of vineyards that are cultivated is clarified in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>taught: Vineyards that are cultivated twice a year.</b> This is done by hoeing the earth underneath the vines.",
    "The Gemara relates the efficacy of cultivating the land twice a year: <b>Rav Yosef had a tract</b> of land <b>that was</b> used <b>an orchard [<i>depardeisa</i>]</b> to <b>which he</b> used to <b>give an extra hoeing, and</b> consequently <b>it produced wine</b> of such superior quality that when preparing the wine for drinking it required <b>a dilution using twice</b> the amount <b>of water</b> than that which is usually used to dilute wine.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: When people produced wine for libations <b>they would not collect</b> the wine <b>into large barrels,</b> as it causes the wine to spoil; rather, it would be placed in small casks. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>casks</b> referred to by the mishna are <b>flasks</b> that are made in <b>Lod and</b> that <b>are medium-sized.</b>",
    "The Gemara adds another <i>halakha</i>: When storing casks containing wine for libations, <b>they should not be placed in twos,</b> i.e., one atop the other, but <b>rather singly,</b> i.e., each one should be placed separately.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>How does</b> the Temple treasurer <b>inspect</b> wine to determine that it is from the middle of the cask? The <b>treasurer sits</b> alongside the cask <b>and</b> has <b>the</b> measuring <b>reed in his hand.</b> The spigot is opened and the wine begins to flow. If he sees that the wine emerging <b>draws</b> with it <b>chalk</b>-like scum, <b>he</b> immediately <b>knocks with the reed</b> to indicate that the spigot should be closed. The precise point at which he knocks is clarified in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>taught:</b> If the wine <b>draws</b> with it <b>chalk</b>-like scum, which comes <b>from the sediment, he knocks with the reed.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges: Why does the treasurer knock with the reed; <b>let him</b> simply <b>speak.</b> The Gemara explains: This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Just as speech is beneficial to the</b> incense <b>spices, so is speech detrimental to wine,</b> and so the treasurer avoids speaking.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> Wine in which there is flour-like white scum is unfit for libations. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma</b> concerning such wine: If <b>one consecrated it</b> to be used as a libation, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>he should be flogged for</b> consecrating <b>it due to</b> the prohibition against consecrating <b>a flawed</b> item as an offering? Does one say that <b>since it</b> is <b>unfit, it is comparable to a blemished</b> animal? <b>Or perhaps,</b> the prohibition to consecrate <b>a flawed</b> item <b>applies only to an animal.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
    "§ Having discussed which flours, oils, and wine are fit to be offered in the Temple, the Gemara considers which animals are of sufficient quality to be used as offerings. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The choicest <b>rams</b> are those <b>from Moab;</b> the choicest <b>lambs</b> are those <b>from Hebron;</b> the choicest <b>calves</b> are those <b>from Sharon;</b> and the choicest <b>fledglings,</b> i.e., doves and pigeons, are those <b>from the King’s Mountain.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One should bring lambs whose height is like their width,</b> i.e., they are so robust that they are as wide as they are tall. <b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written:</b> “And He will give the rain for your seed, with which you sow the ground, and bread of the produce of the ground, and it shall be fat and bountiful; <b>your cattle shall graze in wide pastures [<i>kar nirḥav</i>] on that day”</b> (Isaiah 30:23). The word “<i>kar</i>” can also mean a lamb, and “<i>nirḥav</i>” means wide. Accordingly, Rabbi Yehuda interprets this verse, on a homiletical level, to be alluding to robust sheep.",
    "The chapter concludes by quoting an additional prophecy of Isaiah concerning the rebuilding of Eretz Yisrael: It <b>is written: “I have set watchmen upon your walls, Jerusalem; they shall never be silent day nor night; those who remind the Lord, take no rest”</b> (Isaiah 62:6). This is referring to the angels appointed by God to bring the redemption. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> do these watchmen <b>say</b> to remind the Lord? <b>This</b> is what <b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said:</b> They recite the verse: <b>“You will arise and have compassion upon Zion;</b> for it is time to be gracious to her, for the appointed time has come” (Psalms 102:14).",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> They recite the verse: <b>“The Lord builds up Jerusalem,</b> He gathers together the dispersed of Israel” (Psalms 147:2). The Gemara asks: <b>And initially,</b> when the Temple still stood and the Jewish people were gathered together in Eretz Yisrael, <b>what would</b> the watchmen <b>say? Rava bar Rav Sheila says:</b> They would say: <b>“For the Lord has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His habitation.</b> This is My resting place forever; here will I dwell for I have desired it” (Psalms 132:13–14).",

    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Two</b> sizes of <b>measuring vessels for dry</b> substances <b>were</b> used <b>in the Temple</b> for measuring flour for the meal offerings. One held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>and</b> the other held <b>one-half of a tenth</b> of an ephah. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> There were three measuring vessels; one that held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, another one that also held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah, <b>and</b> a third one that held <b>one</b>-<b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah.",
    "<b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>tenth</b> of an ephah measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was the vessel <b>with which one would measure</b> flour <b>for all the meal offerings. One would not measure</b> the flour by using a measuring vessel of a size that held the entire volume of flour required at once, i.e., <b>neither with</b> a vessel of <b>three-</b>tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the meal offering accompanying the sacrifice of <b>a bull, nor with</b> a vessel of <b>two</b>-tenths of an ephah <b>for</b> the meal offering accompanying the sacrifice of <b>a ram. Rather, one measures</b> the flour for <b>them</b> by repeatedly using the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel to measure the required number of <b>tenths.</b>",
    "<b>What</b> purpose <b>did</b> the <b>one</b>-<b>half of a tenth</b> of an ephah measuring vessel <b>serve?</b> It was the vessel <b>with which one would measure</b> the flour for the <b>High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offering. A tenth of an ephah was required each day; he sacrificed <b>half</b> of it <b>in the morning and</b> the other <b>half</b> of it <b>in the afternoon.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that clarifies Rabbi Meir’s opinion. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A tenth, a tenth, for every lamb”</b> (Numbers 28:29)? The fact the word “tenth” appears twice <b>teaches that there were two</b> measuring vessels that each held <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah <b>in the Temple. One</b> of them held that volume when it was <b>heaped, and</b> the other <b>one</b> was slightly larger and held that same volume when the flour was <b>leveled</b> with the rim.",
    "The one that held a tenth of an ephah when <b>heaped</b> was the vessel <b>with which one would measure</b> the flour <b>for all the meal offerings.</b>"
