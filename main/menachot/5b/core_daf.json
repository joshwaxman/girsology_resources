    "<b>the illumination of</b> the <b>eastern</b> horizon <b>permits</b> the new crop.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Reish Lakish was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference,</b> i.e., it is evident from a different statement of Reish Lakish that this is his opinion. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (68b): <b>One may not bring a meal offering, the first fruits, or the meal offering</b> brought with the libations accompanying <b>an animal</b> offering, from the new crop, <b>prior to</b> the sacrifice of <b>the <i>omer</i>.</b> The Gemara interrupts its citation of the mishna to add that the reason is <b>that we require</b> that an offering be <b>“from the well-watered pastures of Israel,”</b> i.e., it must be brought from that which is permitted to the Jewish people, and the new crop has not yet been permitted to them. The mishna concludes: <b>And if he brought</b> these offerings from the new crop they are <b>unfit.</b>",
    "The mishna continues: After the <i>omer</i> but <b>prior to the two loaves one may not bring</b> those offerings from the new crop. The Gemara explains that this is <b>because</b> the two loaves <b>are called first fruits,</b> and therefore they should precede all other offerings from the new crop. The mishna adds: <b>But if he brought</b> those offerings from the new crop, they are <b>fit.</b>",
    "<b>And Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a meal offering that was brought from the new crop before the <i>omer</i> meal offering is disqualified <b>only</b> if it was brought <b>on the fourteenth or on the fifteenth</b> of Nisan. <b>But</b> if it was <b>on the sixteenth,</b> then even <b>if he brought</b> it prior to the <i>omer</i> meal offering, it is <b>valid.</b> He continues: <b>And</b> this statement poses <b>a difficulty for me:</b> Why should meal offerings be valid when sacrificed on the sixteenth if they were sacrificed before the <i>omer</i> meal offering? <b>Let them be</b> considered <b>like</b> offerings <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Reish Lakish <b>holds</b> that <b>the illumination of the eastern</b> horizon <b>permits</b> the new crop.",
    "§ The Gemara previously cited the opinion of Rav that an <i>omer</i> meal offering from which a handful was removed not for its own sake is disqualified. The Gemara also cited the opinion of Reish Lakish that this meal offering is valid but another <i>omer</i> meal offering is necessary to permit the new crop for consumption. <b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>an <i>omer</i> meal offering</b> from <b>which</b> the priest <b>removed a handful not for its own sake,</b> it is <b>valid and its remainder is consumed, and it does not require another <i>omer</i> meal offering to permit it</b> for consumption. The reason is <b>that</b> improper <b>intent is effective [<i>mo’elet</i>]</b> to disqualify an offering <b>only</b> when it is expressed <b>by one who is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service, and with regard to an item that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service, and in a place that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service.</b>",
    "Rava elaborates: The condition that improper intent disqualifies only when expressed <b>by one who is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the intent of <b>a blemished priest,</b> who is disqualified from performing the Temple service. The condition that it disqualifies only when expressed <b>with regard to an item that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude the <i>omer</i> meal offering, which</b> is generally <b>unfit</b> for the Temple service, <b>as it is a novelty,</b> in that it is brought from barley whereas most meal offerings are brought from wheat. <b>And</b> finally, the condition that it disqualifies only when expressed <b>in a place that is fit for the</b> Temple <b>service</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> sacrificial rites that were performed with improper intent while <b>the altar was damaged.</b> At such a time improper intent does not disqualify an offering, and therefore if the altar is repaired on the same day, the offering may be sacrificed upon the altar.",
    "§ The Gemara discusses the prohibition against sacrificing an item that is prohibited to the Jewish people. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from a passage in the Torah that discusses burnt offerings: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2), that certain animals are prohibited for sacrifice upon the altar (see <i>Temura</i> 28a). <b>When it states later,</b> in the next verse: “If his offering is a burnt offering <b>of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), this is difficult, <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this, as it was already written earlier. <b>Rather,</b> this serves <b>to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> from being brought as an offering.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> questions the need for this derivation: <b>But could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference? And if a blemished</b> animal, <b>which is permitted to an ordinary person [<i>lehedyot</i>]</b> for consumption, is nevertheless <b>prohibited</b> as an offering <b>for the Most High</b> (see Leviticus 22:19), then certainly with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, which is forbidden to an ordinary person</b> for consumption (see Exodus 22:30), <b>is it not logical that it is prohibited for the Most High?</b> The <i>baraita</i> responds: <b>Fat [<i>ḥelev</i>] and blood prove</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not valid, <b>as they are forbidden to an ordinary person and</b> yet <b>they are permitted for the Most High.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about fat and blood?</b> They are notable <b>in that they come from</b> an item that is <b>generally permitted,</b> i.e., the animal from which they come is itself permitted for consumption. Will <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, which is entirely forbidden</b> for eating, <b>and</b> therefore <b>should not be permitted for the Most High?</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> responds: The <b>pinching</b> of bird offerings <b>will prove</b> that one cannot derive by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that a <i>tereifa</i> is disqualified. <b>As</b> a bird killed by the pinching of its nape is also <b>entirely forbidden, and</b> yet although it is <b>forbidden</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person,</b> as it is rendered a carcass, it is nevertheless <b>permitted for the Most High,</b> as bird offerings are killed by the pinching of their napes. The verse is therefore necessary to disqualify a <i>tereifa</i>.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> rejects this suggestion as well: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about pinching?</b> It is notable <b>in that its sanctity prohibits it,</b> i.e., only <b>at the time</b> when <b>it</b> becomes <b>sanctified for the altar</b> does <b>it</b> become <b>prohibited</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person, which is</b> at the time of <b>its pinching. But before this</b> time it is <b>not</b> yet <b>prohibited to an ordinary person</b> for consumption. This <b>is not the case with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, as its sanctity does not prohibit it</b> for consumption, since it is always prohibited to eat it. Accordingly, by logical inference alone one can arrive at the conclusion that a <i>tereifa</i> should not be permitted for the Most High.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> concludes with a statement that will soon be explained: <b>And if you have responded,</b> i.e., if you succeeded in rejecting the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, then <b>when</b> the verse <b>states later: “Of the herd”</b> (Leviticus 1:3), <b>as</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state</b> this phrase, it serves <b>to exclude a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> response is alluded to by the statement: <b>If you have responded?</b> The conclusion of the <i>baraita</i> had indicated that the <i>a fortiori</i> inference must be accepted. The Gemara cites several suggestions, for which it provides the following <b>mnemonic: <i>Rekiaḥ</i>, <i>Mar</i>, <i>Adda</i>, <i>Leshisheih</i>.</b> These terms allude to the names of some of the Sages mentioned in the following discussion: Rav; Rabbi Akiva; Rav Aḥa; Mar, son of Ravina; Rav Adda; and Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi.",
    "<b>Rav said</b> that this is the response: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it may be said</b> that <b>the <i>omer</i> meal offering proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be derived by the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as</b> the <i>omer</i> is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption <b>to an ordinary person,</b> since it comes from the new crop, <b>and</b> yet it is <b>permitted</b> as an offering <b>for the Most High.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>renders</b> the <b>new</b> crop <b>permitted</b> for consumption, whereas a <i>tereifa</i> does not render anything permitted.",
    "The Gemara responds: Although the <i>omer</i> meal offering generally renders the new crop permitted, the <i>omer</i> brought <b>during a Sabbatical Year</b> does not render the crop permitted, as it is prohibited to plant during the Sabbatical Year, and consequently there is no new crop for the <i>omer</i> offering to permit. The Gemara counters this suggestion: The <i>omer</i> meal offering brought during <b>a Sabbatical Year also</b> renders something permitted, <b>as it permits produce that grew without being purposely planted [<i>sefiḥin</i>] during the Sabbatical Year.</b> The Gemara responds: Nevertheless, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b><i>sefiḥin</i> are prohibited during the Sabbatical Year,</b> the <i>omer</i> meal offering brought during a Sabbatical Year does not render the new crop permitted for consumption, and yet it is permitted for the Most High. A verse is therefore necessary to derive that a <i>tereifa</i> may not be sacrificed.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba said to Rav Ashi: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva as well, let us refute</b> the statement of Rav, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>permits</b> the <b>new</b> crop for consumption <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, where the prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year do not apply.",
    "<b>And even according to the one who says</b> that the consumption of produce from the <b>new</b> crop grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>not</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> Rav’s statement can be refuted in another manner: What is notable about the <i>omer</i> meal offering? It is notable <b>in that</b> the <i>omer</i> <b>comes to permit a prohibition</b> that applies to a substance <b>that</b> was previously <b>within it,</b> i.e., the burning upon the altar of a handful from the <i>omer</i> meal offering renders the remainder of the meal offering permitted to the priests, whereas a <i>tereifa</i> is entirely forbidden.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina:</b> This is not a refutation, as, <b>if that is so,</b> then with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i> as well, you should sacrifice</b> it <b>and you will</b> thereby <b>permit a prohibition</b> that applies to a substance <b>that</b> was previously <b>within it,</b> and its meat will become permitted to the priests for consumption. Therefore, a verse is needed to exclude a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather,</b> one can <b>refute</b> the statement of Rav <b>like this: What</b> is notable <b>about the <i>omer</i> meal offering?</b> It is notable <b>in that its mitzva is in this</b> manner, i.e., the Torah requires the <i>omer</i> meal offering to be brought from the new crop in order to permit the new crop for consumption. By contrast, there is no mitzva to sacrifice specifically a <i>tereifa</i>.",
    "<b>Reish Lakish said</b> that this is the response alluded to at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it can be said</b> that <b>the one who prepares the incense proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning a <i>tereifa</i> may not be derived by the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as</b> this is <b>prohibited to an ordinary person, and</b> is nevertheless <b>permitted for the Most High.</b> The Gemara questions the terminology of Reish Lakish: But <b>the one who prepares</b> the incense <b>is a person.</b> How can it be said that a person is prohibited to an ordinary person?",
    "<b>Rather,</b> Reish Lakish meant that <b>the preparation of the incense proves</b> it, <b>as</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to prepare the incense mixture for use <b>by an ordinary person</b> (see Exodus 30:37), <b>and</b> yet it is <b>permitted</b> to do so <b>for the Most High.</b> The Gemara refutes this claim: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about preparation of the incense?</b> It is notable <b>in that its mitzva is in this</b> manner. By contrast, there is no mitzva to sacrifice specifically a <i>tereifa</i>.",
    "<b>Mar, son of Ravina, said</b> that this is the response of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it can be said</b> that <b>Shabbat proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> concerning a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be derived by the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as it is prohibited for an ordinary person</b> to perform labor on Shabbat, <b>and</b> yet the labor involved in the Temple service is <b>permitted</b> on Shabbat <b>for the Most High.</b> Without the verse, one might similarly conclude that a <i>tereifa</i> is permitted for the Most High despite the fact that it is prohibited for consumption.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about Shabbat?</b> It is notable <b>in that the general prohibition</b> against labor on Shabbat <b>was permitted with regard to an ordinary person in</b> the case of <b>circumcision,</b> as the mitzva of circumcision must be performed in its proper time, even on Shabbat, despite the fact that the act of circumcision is generally prohibited on Shabbat.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>circumcision is</b> considered <b>a requirement of an ordinary person,</b> whose performance was exempted from the general prohibition against labor on Shabbat for one’s private needs? <b>Circumcision is a mitzva. Rather,</b> the statement of Mar, son of Ravina, can be refuted like this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about Shabbat?</b> It is notable <b>in that its mitzva is in this</b> manner, i.e., the Torah requires that offerings be brought on Shabbat. By contrast, there is no mitzva to sacrifice specifically a <i>tereifa</i>.",
    "<b>Rav Adda bar Abba said</b> that this is the response mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for sacrifice must be derived from a verse <b>because it can be said</b> that the prohibition against <b>diverse kinds proves</b> that the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be derived from the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>as it is prohibited for an ordinary person</b> to wear garments sewn from a mixture of diverse kinds (Deuteronomy 22:11), <b>and</b> yet such garments are <b>permitted for the Most High,</b> as the belt of the priestly vestments was fashioned from a mixture of diverse kinds.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the prohibition against <b>diverse kinds?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the <b>general prohibition</b> against wearing a garment sewn from diverse kinds <b>was permitted in</b> the case of <b>an ordinary person with regard to ritual fringes,</b> as a string of sky-blue wool must be placed on a four-cornered garment even if that garment is made from linen. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>ritual fringes</b> are considered <b>a requirement of an ordinary person,</b> whose performance was exempted from the general prohibition concerning diverse kinds with regard to one’s private needs? Placing ritual fringes on a garment <b>is a mitzva. Rather,</b> the claim of Rav Adda bar Abba can be refuted like this:"
