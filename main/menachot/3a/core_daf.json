    "The Gemara responds: This is not considered recognizably false intent, as people might <b>say: Perhaps</b> it is actually a sin offering and he has already sprinkled its blood below the red line. And as for the fact that he squeezed its blood above the red line, they will say: <b>It is the squeezing that follows sprinkling,</b> which may be performed above the red line in the case of a sin offering. <b>As the Master said:</b> If one <b>squeezed the blood of</b> a bird sin offering <b>in any place on the altar,</b> the offering is <b>valid.</b> Since people might erroneously think that this bird is actually a sin offering, this intent is not considered recognizably false, so the offering is disqualified.",
    "The Gemara asks another question: According to Rabba’s resolution, <b>a bird sin offering whose blood</b> a priest <b>sprinkled below</b> the red line <b>for the sake of a bird burnt offering should effect acceptance, as the actions</b> performed <b>on it prove that it is a bird sin offering. Because if it is</b> in fact <b>a bird burnt offering, he would have performed it above</b> the red line, <b>and he would have performed</b> the act of <b>squeezing</b> instead of sprinkling.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>Indeed,</b> according to Rabbi Shimon such a bird offering effects acceptance and fulfills the obligation of the owner. In fact, bird offerings were not discussed by Rabbi Shimon at all. <b>Rather, he said: Because meal offerings are not similar to slaughtered offerings,</b> which means that they are not similar <b>to slaughtered</b> animal <b>offerings, but</b> he did not say that they are <b>not</b> similar <b>to bird</b> offerings.",
    "The Gemara asks: But if so, then <b>offerings of the most sacred order that one slaughtered in the northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard, which is a requirement that applies only to offerings of the most sacred order, <b>for the sake of offerings of lesser sanctity, should effect acceptance</b> for their owners, as <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on them prove that they are offerings of the most sacred order. Because if</b> they are in fact <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, he would have performed their</b> slaughter <b>in the southern</b> part of the Temple courtyard.",
    "The Gemara answers: The slaughter of an offering in the northern part of the Temple courtyard is not indicative of the type of offering one intends it to be, as one can <b>say that the Merciful One states</b> that offerings of lesser sanctity may be slaughtered <b>even in the southern</b> part of the courtyard. <b>Did</b> He <b>say</b> that these offerings must be slaughtered specifically <b>in the southern</b> part <b>and not in the northern</b> part? This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 55a), that <b>the slaughter of</b> offerings of lesser sanctity may be performed <b>in any place within the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: If so, then <b>offerings of lesser sanctity that one slaughtered in the southern</b> part of the Temple courtyard <b>for the sake of offerings of the most sacred order should effect acceptance</b> for their owners, as <b>the actions</b> performed <b>on them prove that they are offerings of lesser sanctity. Because if</b> they are in fact <b>offerings of the most sacred order, he would have performed their</b> slaughter <b>in the northern</b> part of the Temple courtyard.",
    "The Gemara responds: The fact that an offering was slaughtered in the southern part of the Temple courtyard is not a clear indication that it was intended as an offering of lesser sanctity, as people might <b>say: They are</b> in fact <b>offerings of the most sacred order, but</b> the priest <b>transgressed</b> the mitzva to slaughter them in the northern part of the courtyard <b>and slaughtered them in the southern</b> part.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if people might suspect an individual of performing the rite of an offering in an improper manner, then if a priest removes a handful from <b>a pan</b> meal offering <b>for the sake of a deep-pan</b> meal offering <b>as well,</b> one who sees <b>that this</b> priest <b>removes a handful for</b> the sake of <b>a deep-pan</b> meal offering might <b>say: This</b> owner <b>took a vow</b> to bring a meal offering <b>in a deep pan, and</b> as for the fact <b>that he brings it in a pan, it is</b> actually the meal offering <b>of a deep pan and</b> the owner <b>transgressed</b> the mitzva to bring it in a deep pan, <b>and brought it in a pan.</b> Why, then, does Rabbi Shimon maintain that such a meal offering satisfies the obligation of its owner?",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> where the priest removed the handful from a pan meal offering for the sake of a deep-pan meal offering, <b>even if</b> the owner <b>took a vow</b> to bring a meal offering <b>in a deep pan, when he brings it in a pan it is</b> considered a valid <b>pan</b> meal offering, and therefore the priest’s intention is recognizably false.",
    "This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (102b): <b>One who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan,</b> or if he says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a meal offering prepared <b>in a deep pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a pan,</b> the meal offering <b>that he brought, he brought,</b> i.e., it is valid and the priest performs the rites of the meal offering that he actually brought, <b>but he did not fulfill</b> the obligation resulting from <b>his vow,</b> and he must bring another meal offering to fulfill that obligation.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even so, the priest’s improper intent remains indiscernible, as people might think: <b>Perhaps</b> the owner <b>said: This</b> tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must <b>bring in a pan, and</b> in spite of this <b>he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan.</b> Such a meal offering is disqualified and is not considered a valid pan meal offering, <b>as we learned</b> in that same mishna: One who took a vow, saying: <b>This</b> tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must <b>bring in a pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a deep pan,</b> or if he vowed: This tenth of an ephah of flour is a meal offering that I must bring <b>in a deep pan, and he brought</b> it <b>in a pan, it is disqualified,</b> as he did not fulfill his vow. If so, how can Rabbi Shimon say that such a meal offering satisfies the owner’s obligation, when the intent is not recognizably false?",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., according to the opinion of the mishna just cited, there is <b>indeed</b> a difficulty. But <b>according to Rabbi Shimon</b> there is no difficulty, <b>since</b> with regard to a case where one took a vow, saying: It is incumbent upon me to bring a pan meal offering, and then he brought it in a deep pan, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: He has fulfilled even</b> the obligation resulting from <b>his vow. Evidently, the designation of the vessel</b> for a meal offering <b>is nothing</b> according to Rabbi Shimon, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> in this regard whether <b>he said: This</b> is for a particular type of meal offering, <b>and there is no difference</b> whether <b>he said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring a particular meal offering. In both instances the unique actions of each particular meal offering prove its identity, and therefore the owner fulfills his obligation regardless of the priest’s improper intent.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that in a case where the manner of its preparation proves the identity of an offering the owner fulfills his obligation, then <b>a burnt offering that one slaughtered for the sake of a sin offering should effect acceptance.</b> His actions prove that it is a burnt offering, <b>as this,</b> a burnt offering, is always <b>male, and that,</b> a sin offering, is <b>female.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since there is</b> one sin offering, <b>the goat of</b> the <b><i>Nasi</i>, which is male, it is unknown</b> whether this animal was a burnt offering or the sin offering of the <i>Nasi</i>, and its gender is not conclusive proof.",
    "The Gemara continues to ask: But in a case where one <b>said:</b> I am hereby slaughtering this animal <b>for the sake of a sin offering of an individual,</b> which is always female, <b>what can be said?</b> Since a male animal cannot be mistaken for such a sin offering, why doesn’t this burnt offering satisfy the obligation of the owner? <b>And furthermore, a sin offering of an individual that one slaughtered for the sake of a burnt offering should effect acceptance, as</b> such <b>a sin offering</b> is always <b>female, and a burnt offering</b> is always <b>male.</b> The Gemara responds: It is difficult to discern whether a lamb is male or female, as its genitals are <b>covered by</b> its <b>tail.</b> Accordingly, its gender is not considered proof of the type of offering being sacrificed.",
    "The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>where one brought a female lamb</b> as his sin offering, as its tail makes it difficult to discern its sex. But in a case where he <b>brought a female goat, what can be said?</b> Its gender is easily recognized, as goats do not have tails that cover their genitals. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> discerning <b>between males and females is not on people’s minds,</b> i.e., they do not take notice of the offering’s gender and therefore this aspect of an animal is not considered discernible.",
    "The Gemara continues to challenge the opinion of Rabba: <b>A Paschal offering that one slaughtered for the sake of a guilt offering should effect acceptance, as this,</b> the Paschal offering, is <b>in its</b> first <b>year, and that,</b> a guilt offering, is <b>in its second</b> year. The Gemara answers: <b>Since there are</b> two guilt offerings that are brought from lambs in their first year, i.e., <b>the guilt offering of a nazirite</b> (see Numbers 6:12) <b>and the guilt offering of a leper</b> (see Leviticus 14:10), <b>it is not definitively</b> clear <b>to</b> an onlooker what type of offering this lamb is.",
    "The Gemara asks: But if one <b>said:</b> I am hereby slaughtering this lamb <b>for the sake of a guilt offering for robbery, or</b> if he said: I am slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a guilt offering for misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>what can be said?</b> These guilt offerings must each be brought from an animal in its second year, and therefore they cannot be mistaken for a Paschal offering, which is in its first year. <b>And furthermore, a guilt offering for robbery or a guilt offering for misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>that one slaughtered for the sake of a Paschal offering should effect acceptance, as a Paschal offering is</b> always <b>in its</b> first <b>year, and these are in their second year.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the difference in appearance <b>between</b> an animal that is <b>in its</b> first <b>year and</b> one that is <b>in its second year is not on people’s minds,</b> i.e., this is not a clearly recognizable difference, <b>as there</b> can <b>be</b> an animal <b>in its</b> first <b>year that appears as</b> though it is <b>in its second</b> year, <b>and there</b> can <b>be</b> an animal <b>in its second</b> year <b>that appears as</b> though it is <b>in its</b> first <b>year.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>A goat</b> sin offering <b>that one slaughtered for the sake of a guilt offering should effect acceptance.</b> It is clearly not a guilt offering, <b>as this,</b> a guilt offering, is a ram, with white <b>wool, and that,</b> a goat, has black <b>hair.</b> The Gemara responds: People will <b>say</b> that this goat <b>is</b> actually <b>a black ram,</b> and they may indeed mistake it for a guilt offering.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>A calf or a bull that one slaughtered for the sake of</b> either <b>a Paschal offering or a guilt offering should effect acceptance.</b> It is clear that such animals cannot be either offering, <b>as a calf or bull</b> offering <b>is not</b> sacrificed either <b>as a Paschal offering or</b> as <b>a guilt offering.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so,</b> as according to Rabbi Shimon such offerings effect acceptance for their owners."
