    "therefore, even <b>if they are no</b> longer <b>fit to</b> be sacrificed as <b>obligatory burnt offerings,</b> for which they were originally consecrated, having now been slaughtered not for their own sake <b>they can</b> still <b>be sacrificed as voluntary burnt offerings,</b> without the need to fulfill the additional conditions that originally applied to them. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the guilt offering of a leper, <b>if you do not maintain it in accordance with its</b> original <b>status</b> and require it to be brought together with its libations, it can no longer be considered a guilt offering at all, as <b>is there a voluntary guilt offering?</b>",
    "The Gemara notes that it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> In the case of <b>a guilt offering of a leper that one slaughtered not for its own sake, or</b> in a case <b>where one did not place</b> some <b>of its blood upon</b> the leper’s right <b>thumb and big toe, this</b> guilt offering <b>is</b> still <b>brought up upon the altar and requires libations,</b> i.e., a meal offering and wine-libation; <b>but</b> since it was sacrificed incorrectly, the leper <b>needs</b> to bring <b>another guilt offering to permit him</b> to partake of offerings.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All measuring vessels that were in the Temple were</b> such that they held the volume that they measured when their contents were <b>heaped</b> above the rim, <b>except for</b> the measuring vessel used to measure the flour for the griddle-cake offering <b>of the High Priest, as its heaped</b> measure, i.e., the quantity of flour held by a tenth of an ephah measuring vessel when heaped, <b>was contained within its</b> walls when the flour was leveled with the rim. This was due to the fact that the measuring vessel for the griddle-cake offering was slightly larger than the tenth of an ephah measuring vessel.",
    "With regard to <b>measuring vessels for liquids, their overflows,</b> i.e., that which flows onto the outside of vessel’s walls, <b>are sacred, but</b> with regard to <b>measuring vessels for dry</b> substances, <b>their overflows are non-sacred.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the reason for this difference is that since the <b>measuring vessels for liquids</b> are themselves <b>sacred, therefore their overflows are sacred,</b> and since the <b>measuring vessels for dry</b> substances are <b>non-sacred, therefore their overflows are non-sacred. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The difference is <b>not due to that</b> factor. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because the</b> overflow of <b>liquid</b> was originally inside the vessel, where it became consecrated, and <b>was</b> then <b>displaced,</b> whereas <b>the</b> overflow of <b>a dry</b> substance <b>was not displaced</b> from inside the vessel, so it had not become consecrated.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna and Gemara on 87a cite a dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Meir concerning the number and nature of the measuring vessels used for dry substances. In light of that dispute, the Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna here? <b>If</b> you suggest it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> that is difficult: He holds that there were two measuring vessels that held a tenth of an ephah, but only <b>one</b> of them <b>was</b> such that it held its measure <b>when heaped;</b> the other one held its measure when leveled. And <b>if</b> you suggest it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that is difficult: They hold <b>there was</b> only <b>one</b> measuring vessel that held a tenth of an ephah, <b>and</b> it held its measure when <b>leveled.</b> How can the mishna state that all measuring vessels in the Temple were heaped?",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Actually,</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that only one of two measuring vessels that held a tenth of an ephah was such that it held its measure when heaped. <b>And what</b> does the mishna means when it states: <b>All measuring vessels [<i>kol middot</i>]</b> in the Temple were heaped? It means that that <b>all measurements [<i>kol medidot</i>]</b> performed with that measuring vessel were done when its contents were heaped above its rim.",
    "§ The mishna discusses the status of overflows: The first <i>tanna</i> states simply that with regard to <b>measuring vessels for liquids, their overflows are sacred,</b> but with regard to measuring vessels for dry substances, their overflows are non-sacred. Rabbi Akiva explains that this distinction is a function of whether the measuring vessel is itself sacred. Rabbi Yosei explains it is function of whether the overflow had initially been inside the vessel. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>do</b> these three <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree?</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items, e.g., wine for libations and oil, were <b>anointed</b> and thereby consecrated <b>both on</b> the <b>inside and on</b> the <b>outside.</b> Therefore, the overflow is consecrated as it comes in contact with the outside of the vessel’s walls. The <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items, such as the flour for meal offerings, <b>were anointed</b> and consecrated only <b>on</b> the <b>inside, but were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside.</b> Therefore, the overflow is not consecrated when it comes into contact with the outside of the vessel’s walls.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> who states the difference is due to whether the vessel is sacred or non-sacred, <b>holds</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>liquid</b> items <b>were anointed on</b> the <b>inside and were not anointed on</b> the <b>outside,</b> whereas the <b>measuring</b> vessels for <b>dry</b> items <b>were not anointed at all,</b> and they remained non-sacred and so could not consecrate the overflow.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>this and that,</b> i.e., both types of measuring vessels, <b>were anointed</b> only <b>on the inside but were not anointed on the outside, and</b> so <b>here, this is the reason</b> behind whether the overflow was sacred: <b>As</b> the overflow <b>of liquid</b> was originally inside the vessel and <b>was</b> then <b>displaced, and it comes from the inside of the vessel,</b> it is therefore consecrated. <b>But the</b> overflow of <b>a dry</b> substance <b>was not</b> originally inside the vessel and then <b>displaced,</b> and so it is never consecrated.",
    "The Gemara questions this explanation of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>But</b> even <b>if</b> the overflow <b>was</b> previously inside the vessel and then <b>displaced, what of it? A person intends</b> to consecrate only <b>that which he requires,</b> and so even if the overflow had been inside the vessel it would not have been consecrated.",
    "<b>Rav Dimi bar Shishna said in the name of Rav: That is to say</b> that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> their contents even <b>without</b> the <b>intent</b> of the person using them. <b>Ravina said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>service vessels consecrate</b> their contents <b>only with</b> the <b>intent</b> of the person using them, and by Torah law the overflows are not sacred. <b>But</b> the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> to regard them as sacred, <b>lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>one may transfer</b> a substance that has been consecrated <b>in a service vessel to non-sacred</b> status.",
    "<b>Rabbi Zeira raised an objection</b> to this explanation from a mishna (100a): Each Shabbat, new shewbread and bowls of frankincense were arranged on the Table in the Sanctuary. They remained there until the following Shabbat, at which point the frankincense was burned, thereby permitting the shewbread to be eaten. If the priest <b>arranged the bread and the bowls</b> of frankincense on the Table <b>after Shabbat,</b> during the week, <b>and</b> then <b>he burned the</b> frankincense in the <b>bowls on</b> the <b>Shabbat</b> at the end of that week, the bread is <b>disqualified,</b> as it had not been on the Table for a full seven days from one Shabbat to the next. <b>How</b> then <b>should one proceed</b> to prevent the disqualification? <b>He should leave</b> the bread on the Table <b>until the following Shabbat, as even if it remained on the Table for many days,</b> there is <b>nothing</b> wrong <b>with that,</b> provided that it is there for at least seven days. The frankincense may then be burned and it will permit the bread to be eaten.",
    "Rabbi Zeira explains his objection: <b>But why</b> is it permitted to leave the bread on the Table for more than seven days? <b>There too, let us say</b> that the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> disqualifying the bread <b>lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>one can store</b> sacred items <b>in a service vessel</b> overnight and that will prevent them becoming disqualified. Evidently, the Sages did not issue such decrees, and it follows that also with regard to using the measuring vessels they did not issue a decree.",
    "The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>Are you raising a contradiction</b> between a rite performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., the arrangement of the shewbread, <b>and</b> a rite performed <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., using the measuring vessels? Since in the case of a rite performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>not everyone is aware</b> of what is happening, there is no concern that people will misinterpret what is going on and so there is no need to issue a decree concerning it. In the case of a rite performed <b>outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>everyone is aware</b> of what is happening, and there is a need to issue a decree to prevent people from drawing mistaken conclusions.",
    "§ The Gemara continues to discuss the overflow of measures. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shekalim</i> 10b): <b>The surplus libations</b> were sold and the proceeds used <b>to</b> purchase <b>supplementary</b> offerings <b>of the altar [<i>keitz hamizbe’aḥ</i>].</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Surplus libations?</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> It means <b>the overflows of measuring vessels. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Surplus libations are <b>like that which we learned</b> in another mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 13a): In the case of <b>one who accepts upon himself to supply fine flour at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> its market price <b>stood at three</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, he is required to fulfill his commitment and <b>supply</b> fine flour <b>at four</b> <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>."
