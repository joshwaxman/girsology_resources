    "<b>so that I can hide from you</b> at that time and avoid coming under your gaze.",
    "§ The Gemara has so far presented one version of the discussion of the mishna. <b>A different version relates</b> the discussion as follows: The Sages initially <b>assumed: What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>meḥitza</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? <b>A division,</b> not a partition, <b>as it is written: “And the division of [<i>meḥetzat</i>] the congregation was”</b> (Numbers 31:43). According to this interpretation, the mishna means to say: <b>Since they wished</b> to divide the jointly owned courtyard, <b>they build</b> a proper <b>wall</b> in the center even <b>against the will</b> of one of the partners. <b>Apparently,</b> it may be concluded that <b>damage</b> caused by <b>sight is called damage.</b>",
    "The Gemara objects to this conclusion: <b>But</b> why not <b>say: What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>meḥitza</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? It means <b>a partition.</b> This usage would be <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Consider the case where <b>a partition of [<i>meḥitzat</i>] a vineyard</b> which separates the vineyard from a field of grain <b>was breached,</b> resulting, if the situation is not rectified, in the grain and grapes becoming items from which deriving benefit is prohibited. The owner of the field of grain may <b>say to</b> the owner of the vineyard: <b>Build a partition</b> between the vineyard and the field of grain. If the owner of the vineyard did so, and the partition <b>was breached again,</b> the owner of the field of grain may <b>say to him</b> again: <b>Build a partition.</b> If the owner of the vineyard <b>neglected</b> to make the necessary repairs <b>and did not</b> properly <b>build a partition</b> between the fields, the grain and grapes are <b>rendered forbidden</b> due to the prohibition of diverse kinds planted in a vineyard, <b>and he is liable for the</b> monetary <b>loss.</b>",
    "The Gemara concludes stating the objection: <b>And</b> according to the understanding that the term <i>meḥitza</i> means a partition, one can infer: <b>The reason</b> that they build a wall is <b>that they</b> both <b>wished</b> to make a partition in their jointly owned courtyard. <b>But if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to do so, the court <b>does not obligate</b> the reluctant partner to build such a wall, although his neighbor objects to the fact that the partner can see what he is doing in his courtyard. <b>Apparently,</b> it may be concluded that <b>damage</b> caused by <b>sight is not called damage.</b>",
    "The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If so,</b> the words: <b>They build the wall,</b> are imprecise, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have said: They build it,</b> since the wall and the partition are one and the same. The Gemara retorts: <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the term <i>meḥitza</i>? <b>A division. If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the term <i>meḥitza</i> means a division, the words: <b>Who wished to make a division,</b> are imprecise, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have said: Who wished to divide.</b> The Gemara answers: The phrasing of the mishna is <b>as people</b> commonly <b>say: Come, let us make a division.</b> Consequently, the mishna can also be understood as referring to two people who wished to divide a jointly owned area.",
    "The Gemara asks, according to the understanding that <i>meḥitza</i> means division: <b>But if damage</b> caused by <b>sight is called damage, why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically</b> teach that <b>if they wish,</b> they build a wall? <b>Even if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to do so, it should <b>also</b> be possible to compel the reluctant party to build a wall between them. <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Our mishna</b> is referring to a courtyard <b>that is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division.</b> Joint owners of a courtyard cannot be compelled to divide the courtyard unless each party will receive at least four square cubits of the courtyard. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>this</b> ruling of the mishna applies only in the case <b>where they</b> both <b>wished</b> to divide the courtyard.",
    "The Gemara asks: According to this understanding, <b>what is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching us?</b> Is he teaching us <b>that when</b> a courtyard <b>is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division, if they</b> nevertheless <b>wished</b> to do so, <b>they divide</b> it? But <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in the latter clause of a different mishna (11a): <b>When</b> do they not divide the courtyard because it is not large enough to compel division? <b>When</b> the joint owners <b>do not both wish</b> to divide it. <b>But when both of them wish</b> to divide it, <b>they divide</b> it <b>even</b> if it is <b>smaller than this,</b> i.e., smaller than four square cubits for each party. The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> we had learned this <i>halakha</i> only <b>from there, I would say</b> that they divide the courtyard <b>even</b> if it is <b>smaller than this by</b> constructing <b>a mere partition of pegs,</b> which does not prevent invasion of privacy. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us here</b> in this mishna that if they wish to divide the courtyard they can be compelled to build a proper <b>wall.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach this</b> mishna <b>and not teach that</b> other mishna, as this mishna teaches more details than the later one. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to teach the other mishna to introduce <b>the last clause</b> of that mishna, which states: <b>And</b> jointly owned <b>sacred writings</b> that are contained in a single scroll <b>should not be divided even if both</b> owners <b>wish</b> to do so.",
    "The Gemara brings <b>a different version</b> of the previous discussion: <b>And if they wished</b> to divide the courtyard, <b>what of it?</b> What forces them to build the wall? If one of the parties does not wish to build a wall, <b>let him retract. Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the mishna is not discussing a case where they merely reached a verbal agreement to divide the courtyard, but rather with a case where each party <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other, confirming their respective commitments. Therefore, neither side can retract.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather than teaching us</b> a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division, but</b> nevertheless <b>they wished</b> to divide it, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach us</b> a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>is subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division, even if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to divide it. The Gemara answers: <b>Had it taught us</b> only a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>is subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division</b> that applies <b>even if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to divide it, <b>I would say</b> that in a case where the courtyard <b>is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division</b> then <b>even if they</b> both <b>wished</b> to divide it, if one of the parties does not wish to build a proper wall he <b>cannot</b> be compelled to do so. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that he is compelled to participate.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But how can you say this? Doesn’t the latter clause</b> of the mishna (11a) <b>teach: When</b> do they not divide the courtyard because it is not large enough to compel division? <b>When the</b> joint owners <b>do not both wish</b> to divide it. <b>But when both of them wish</b> to divide it, <b>they divide</b> it even if it is smaller than this. <b>What,</b> is this clause of the mishna <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the fact that either one can force the other to build a proper <b>wall?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>a mere partition of pegs</b> and not to an actual wall.",
    "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach this</b> mishna <b>and not teach that</b> other mishna, as this mishna teaches more details than the later one. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach the other mishna for <b>the last clause</b> of that mishna, which states: <b>And</b> jointly owned <b>sacred writings</b> that are contained in a single scroll <b>should not be divided even if both</b> owners <b>wish</b> to do so. This concludes the alternative version of the discussion.",
    "The Gemara continues its analysis of the mishna: <b>To what</b> case <b>did you interpret the mishna</b> to be referring? To a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division.</b> But <b>if there is no <i>halakha</i> of division,</b> then <b>if they wished</b> to divide the courtyard, <b>what of it;</b> how can either one force the other to build a wall? If the parties no longer want to build a wall, <b>let them retract. Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is referring to a case where each party <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other, confirming their respective commitments. Therefore, neither party can retract.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even <b>if</b> each party <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other, <b>what of it? It is merely a verbal acquisition,</b> meaning there was no actual transfer of property, but only a verbal agreement to act in a certain manner in the future and not a true act of acquisition. The Gemara answers: <b>They performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other <b>with regard to directions,</b> i.e., not only did they verbally agree to divide the courtyard, they also determined which of them would get which part of the courtyard. Consequently, the acquisition related to actual property, a particular plot of land. <b>Rav Ashi said: For example, this one walked through his</b> designated portion and <b>performed an act demonstrating ownership</b> there, <b>and that one walked through his</b> designated portion <b>and performed an act demonstrating ownership</b> there.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: In <b>a place where it is customary to build</b> such a wall with non-chiseled stone [<i>gevil</i>], or chiseled stone [<i>gazit</i>], or small bricks [<i>kefisin</i>], or large bricks [<i>leveinim</i>], they must build the wall with that material. The Gemara identifies the various building materials: <b><i>Gevil</i></b> refers to <b>stones that are not planed. <i>Gazit</i></b> means <b>stones that are planed, as it is written: “All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of chiseled stones [<i>gazit</i>],</b> sawed with saws, within and without” (I Kings 7:9). This teaches that chiseled stones are those that have been planed and smoothened. <b><i>Kefisin</i></b> refers to <b>small bricks. <i>Leveinim</i></b> means <b>large bricks.</b>",
    "<b>Rabba, the son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> do you know <b>that <i>gevil</i></b> refers to <b>stones that are not planed, and this extra handbreadth</b> that a wall of <i>gevil</i> has compared to what a wall of <i>gazit</i> has is <b>for the protruding edges?</b> That is, a wall of <i>gevil</i> is six handbreadths thick because the stones have not been planed and smoothened, and therefore protrude somewhat outward. <b>Perhaps</b> <i>gevil</i> refers to planed stones that <b>are half</b> the thickness <b>of <i>gazit</i>,</b> namely, just two and a half handbreadths, as compared to <i>gazit</i>, which is five handbreadths thick; <b>and this extra handbreadth</b> in a wall of <i>gevil</i> <b>is</b> for the space <b>between the</b> two <b>rows [<i>urbei</i>].</b> That is, a wall of <i>gevil</i> is actually two walls of planed stones that are each two and a half handbreadths thick; and the two walls are separated by one handbreadth, which is later filled in with mortar for added strength.",
    "A proof for this explanation can be brought from <b>what we say,</b> i.e., that <b><i>kefisin</i></b> are <b>small bricks,</b> whereas <b><i>leveinim</i></b> are <b>large bricks,</b> twice the thickness of small bricks. <b>And this extra handbreadth</b> of thickness that a wall of <i>kefisin</i> has compared to what a wall of <i>levinim</i> has is for the space <b>between the</b> two <b>rows</b> of small bricks.",
    "Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning, from where do we</b> derive that <b><i>kefisin</i></b> are <b>small bricks? Rather,</b> the Sages <b>learned this as a tradition.</b> And <b>so too, they learned as a tradition</b> that <b><i>gevil</i> refers to non-planed stones.</b>",
    "The Gemara presents a different version of the discussion. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> do you know <b>that <i>kefisin</i> are small bricks,</b> one-half the width of large bricks, <b>and this extra handbreadth</b> of thickness that a wall of <i>kefisin</i> has compared to what a wall of <i>leveinim</i> has covers the space <b>between the</b> two <b>rows</b> of <i>kefisin</i>? <b>Perhaps</b> you should say <b>what</b> are <b><i>kefisin</i>? Stones that</b> are <b>not planed, and this extra handbreadth</b> of thickness that a wall of <i>kefisin</i> has in comparison to what a wall of <i>leveinim</i> has <b>is for the protruding edges.</b> And proof for this explanation can be brought from <b>what we say,</b> i.e., that <b><i>gevil</i></b> refers to <b>stones that</b> are <b>not planed,</b> whereas <b><i>gazit</i></b> means <b>planed stones, and this extra handbreadth</b> of thickness that a wall of <i>gevil</i> has compared to what a wall of <i>gazit</i> has <b>is for the protruding edges.</b>",
    "Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning, from where do we</b> derive that <b><i>gevil</i> are stones that</b> are <b>not planed? Rather,</b> the Sages <b>learned</b> this <b>as a tradition. Here too, they learned as a tradition</b> that <i>kefisin</i> are small bricks.",
    "<b>Abaye said: Learn from it</b> that the space left <b>between the</b> two <b>rows</b> of a wall <b>is always a handbreadth.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This matter</b> applies only when the two rows of the wall are filled in <b>with mortar. But</b> when they are filled in <b>with gravel [<i>berikhsa</i>], more</b> space <b>is required. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this matter</b> applies only when the two rows of the wall are filled in <b>with gravel. But when mortar</b> is used to fill in the space, <b>not as much</b> space <b>is required,</b> and less than a handbreadth suffices.",
    "§ The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that</b> in the case of a wall of <b>chiseled stone, if for every four cubits of height there are five</b> handbreadths <b>of thickness</b> the wall <b>will stand,</b> and <b>if not it will not stand,</b> as this is the required ratio between a wall’s height and its thickness? <b>But wasn’t there</b> the <b>one-cubit-thick wall separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary of the Temple [<i>amah teraksin</i>]</b> separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary, <b>which was thirty cubits high and its thickness was only six handbreadths and</b> nevertheless <b>stood?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since there was an extra handbreadth</b> of thickness, it was able to <b>stand</b> even to such a great height.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>in the Second Temple they did not fashion an <i>amah teraksin</i></b> to separate between the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary, as they had done in the First Temple? The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> a partition <b>stands</b> even though it is only six handbreadths thick, <b>it is</b> able to remain standing up to <b>thirty</b> cubits in height. But <b>it will not</b> be able to <b>stand</b> if it is <b>more</b> than that height. The Second Temple was taller than the First Temple, and therefore the partition separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary also had to be higher.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the Second Temple <b>was taller</b> than the First Temple? <b>As it is written: “The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former”</b> (Haggai 2:9). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree about the meaning of this verse, <b>and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar</b> who disagreed as to its meaning. <b>One</b> of them <b>said</b> that it means that the Second Temple will be greater <b>in</b> the size of its <b>structure,</b> i.e., taller. <b>And one</b> of them <b>said</b>"
