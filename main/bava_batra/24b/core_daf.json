    "<b>of those who pour wine</b> from barrels into jugs <b>are Jews,</b> and therefore it is reasonable that the wine belongs to a Jew. The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter</b> applies <b>only to large</b> jugs. <b>But</b> if they were <b>small</b> jugs, one can <b>say</b> that <b>they were dropped by travelers,</b> most of whom are gentiles, and therefore the jugs of wine are forbidden. <b>And if there are large</b> jugs <b>among</b> the found jugs, <b>say</b> that they all belong to Jews, as travelers do not usually carry large jugs; it can be assumed that the small ones <b>were placed to balance</b> the donkey’s load, and the jugs all fell together.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance a tree twenty-five cubits from the city, and</b> in the cases <b>of a carob tree and of a sycamore tree,</b> which have a great many branches, they must be distanced <b>fifty cubits. Abba Shaul says: Every barren tree</b> must be distanced <b>fifty cubits. And if the city preceded</b> the tree, as one later planted the tree alongside the city, he <b>cuts down</b> the tree, <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money</b> to the tree’s owner in compensation. <b>And if the tree preceded</b> the city, which expanded after one planted the tree until it reached the tree, he <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>gives money</b> to its owner. If it is <b>uncertain whether this one was first or that one was first,</b> he <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that one must distance a tree from a city? <b>Ulla says:</b> It is <b>due to the beauty of the city,</b> as it is unattractive for a city’s walls to be obscured by tree branches. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> from the statement in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> (33b) <b>that one may neither convert a field</b> of a city into <b>an open area</b> surrounding the city, <b>nor may one</b> convert <b>an open area</b> into <b>a field,</b> as these have fixed places and measurements (see Numbers 35:1–8). If one plants trees in a city’s open area, he thereby turns the open area into a field.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to supply the reason given by Ulla <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who says:</b> One <b>may convert a field</b> into <b>an open area, and an open area</b> into <b>a field. Here, we do not</b> plant trees, <b>due to the beauty of the city.</b>",
    "<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis as well, who say</b> that <b>one may not convert a field</b> into <b>an open area, nor</b> convert <b>an open area</b> into <b>a field,</b> one can say that <b>this matter</b> applies only to <b>seeds,</b> i.e., one may not plant seeds in a city’s open area and thereby turn it into a field. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>trees, we do</b> plant them in an open area. <b>But here</b> we do <b>not</b> plant trees, <b>due to the beauty of the city.</b>",
    "<b>And from where do you say,</b> i.e., on what basis do you maintain, <b>that</b> there is <b>a difference between seeds and trees? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat: With regard to <b>an enclosure [<i>karpef</i> ]</b> whose area is <b>greater than two <i>beit se’a</i></b> but <b>that was enclosed</b> from the outset <b>for the purpose of residence,</b> it is permitted to carry within it on Shabbat regardless of its size, as it is considered a private domain.",
    "If subsequently <b>the greater part of it was sown</b> with seed crops, <b>it is</b> considered <b>like a garden,</b> which is not a place of residence, <b>and it is prohibited</b> to carry anything within it on Shabbat. If <b>the greater part of it was planted</b> with trees, <b>it is</b> considered <b>like a courtyard,</b> which is a place of dwelling, <b>and it is permitted</b> to carry there on Shabbat. This shows that planting trees in an enclosure does not transform the area into a field, as is the case when seeds are planted.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if the city preceded</b> the tree he <b>cuts down</b> the tree, <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to a cistern, that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of another mishna (25b) <b>teaches</b> that if one plants a tree next to a neighbor’s existing cistern, the owner of the tree <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the owner of the cistern <b>gives money; and what is different here that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the owner of the tree <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Kahana said,</b> citing a popular aphorism: <b>A pot belonging to partners is neither hot nor cold,</b> i.e., no one takes responsibility for an item that belongs to several people, as opposed to a single individual. Here too, there is no specific person who will pay for the tree.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the difficulty</b> to begin with? <b>Perhaps damage</b> caused <b>to public</b> property <b>is different from damage</b> caused to the property <b>of an individual.</b> Consequently, when one’s tree causes damage to the public he is not compensated for having to cut it down, whereas he does receive payment when his tree damages a private cistern.",
    "<b>Rather, if Rav Kahana’s</b> comment <b>was stated</b> in this context, <b>it was stated about the latter clause: If the tree preceded</b> the city, he <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>gives money</b> to its owner. Concerning this <i>halakha</i> one could ask: <b>And let</b> the tree owner <b>say to</b> the city residents: <b>Give me money first and then I will cut down</b> the tree. In this context, <b>Rav Kahana said: A pot belonging to partners is neither hot nor cold.</b> If the owner of the tree is entitled to wait until he had first collects money, a good deal of time would pass before the tree would be cut down. Therefore, a community need not collect money and pay immediately, unlike an individual.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that if it is <b>uncertain whether this one was first or that one was first,</b> he <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money.</b> The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> that of a tree alongside <b>a cistern,</b> concerning <b>which you said</b> in the mishna (25b) that in a case of uncertainty the owner of the tree need <b>not cut down</b> the tree?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> if it were a case <b>of certainty</b> the tree would <b>not</b> be <b>subject to being cut down;</b> therefore, in a case <b>of uncertainty too, we do not say to</b> the owner of the tree: <b>Cut</b> it <b>down.</b> In that case, if the tree preceded the cistern, the owner of the tree would not be required to cut it down. <b>Here,</b> if it were a case <b>of certainty,</b> the tree would be <b>subject to being cut down</b> even if it preceded the city, and the only uncertainty is whether or not the owner of the tree would need to be compensated. Consequently, in a case <b>of uncertainty too, we say to</b> the owner of the tree: <b>Cut</b> it <b>down. And if</b> the owner of the tree lodges a claim <b>due</b> to the <b>value</b> of the tree, as he wants compensation for it, <b>we say to him: Bring proof</b> that your tree came first, <b>and take</b> your money. Since he has no proof, he does not receive any money.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance a permanent threshing floor fifty cubits from the city,</b> so that the chaff will not harm the city’s residents. Furthermore, <b>a person should not establish a permanent threshing floor</b> even <b>on his own</b> property <b>unless he has fifty cubits</b> of open space <b>in every direction. And one must distance</b> a threshing floor <b>from the plantings of another and from</b> another’s <b>plowed field</b> far <b>enough that it does not cause damage.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, which states a fixed measurement for the distance of a threshing floor from a city, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> which does not provide a measurement but simply states in general terms: Enough that it does not cause damage? <b>Abaye said:</b> In <b>the latter clause we arrive at</b> the case of <b>a threshing floor that is not permanent.</b> This threshing floor must be far enough from a neighbor that it does not cause damage to his property.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a threshing floor that is not permanent? Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> It refers to <b>any</b> threshing floor <b>where</b> one processes such a small quantity of grain that <b>he does not winnow with a winnowing shovel,</b> but employs some other method that does not scatter the chaff as far. This is one resolution of the contradiction.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the phrase: Enough that it does not cause damage, is not referring to a distance but provides an explanation. In other words, the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: What is the reason</b> for the ruling of the first clause, as follows: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>one must distance a permanent threshing floor fifty cubits from the city?</b> It must be far <b>enough</b> away <b>that it does not cause damage.</b>",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against the opinion of Abaye from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One must distance a permanent threshing floor fifty cubits from the city; and just as one distances</b> it <b>fifty cubits from the city, so too does one distance</b> it <b>fifty cubits from the gourds, cucumbers, plantings, and plowed field of another, enough that it does not cause damage. Granted,</b> this <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi,</b> as he claims that in both clauses the same distance is required: One must move a threshing floor fifty cubits from a plowed field and from those plantings. <b>But according to</b> the explanation of <b>Abaye,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara comments: Indeed, it is <b>difficult.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks with regard to the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> one must distance his threshing floor <b>from his</b> neighbor’s <b>cucumbers and gourds, as the chaff</b> from the threshing floor <b>goes</b> and penetrates <b>into the heart</b> of the flower <b>and dries it out. But why</b> must one distance the threshing floor <b>from</b> another’s <b>plowed field? Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zutra:</b> It is <b>because</b>"
