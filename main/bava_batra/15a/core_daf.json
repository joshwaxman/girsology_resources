    "<b>and by the three sons of Korah.</b>",
    "<b>Jeremiah wrote his own book, and the book of Kings, and Lamentations. Hezekiah and his colleagues wrote</b> the following, and <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember which books they wrote is <b><i>yod</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>kuf</i>: Isaiah [<i>Yeshaya</i>], Proverbs [<i>Mishlei</i>], Song of Songs [<i>Shir HaShirim</i>], and Ecclesiastes [<i>Kohelet</i>]. The members of the Great Assembly wrote</b> the following, and <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember these books is <b><i>kuf</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>gimmel</i>: Ezekiel [<i>Yeḥezkel</i> ], and the Twelve Prophets [<i>Sheneim Asar</i>], Daniel</b> [<b><i>Daniel</i></b> ], <b>and the Scroll of Esther [<i>Megillat Ester</i>]. Ezra wrote his own book and the genealogy of</b> the book of <b>Chronicles until his</b> period.",
    "The Gemara comments: This <b>supports Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Ezra did not ascend from Babylonia</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>until he established his own genealogy, and</b> after that he <b>ascended.</b> This genealogy is what is written in the book of Chronicles. <b>And who completed</b> the book of Chronicles for the generations following Ezra? <b>Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah.</b>",
    "The Gemara elaborates on the particulars of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above that <b>Joshua wrote his own book and eight verses of the Torah.</b> The Gemara comments: This <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught in accordance with the one who says that</b> it was <b>Joshua</b> who <b>wrote the</b> last <b>eight verses in the Torah.</b> This point is subject to a tannaitic dispute, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And Moses the servant of the Lord died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5); <b>is it possible that</b> after <b>Moses died, he</b> himself <b>wrote “And Moses died there”? Rather, Moses wrote</b> the entire Torah <b>until this point,</b> and <b>Joshua wrote from this</b> point <b>forward;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> stated this opinion.",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: Is it possible</b> that the <b>Torah scroll was missing a single letter? But it is written: “Take this Torah scroll”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it. <b>Rather, until this point the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated</b> after Him <b>and wrote</b> the text. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> with respect to Moses’ death, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote with tears.</b> The fact that the Torah was written by way of dictation can be seen <b>later, as it is stated</b> concerning the writing of the Prophets: <b>“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> When the Torah is read publicly in the synagogue, <b>one</b> person <b>reads the</b> last <b>eight verses in the Torah,</b> and that section may not be divided between two readers? <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> as according to Rabbi Shimon these verses are an integral part of the Torah, written by Moses just like the rest? The Gemara answers: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that this was said in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, since they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in one way, as Moses wrote them with tears, <b>they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in this way as well, i.e., they may not be divided between two readers.",
    "It is stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Joshua wrote his own book.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> toward the end of the book: <b>“And Joshua, son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died”</b> (Joshua 24:29)? Is it possible that Joshua wrote this? The Gemara answers: Aaron’s son <b>Eleazar completed it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it</b> also <b>written: “And Eleazar, son of Aaron, died”</b> (Joshua 24:33)? The Gemara answers: <b>Pinehas completed it.</b>",
    "It is also stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Samuel wrote his own book.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And Samuel died”</b> (I Samuel 28:3)? The Gemara answers: <b>Gad the seer and Nathan the prophet finished it.</b>",
    "It is further stated that <b>David wrote the book of Psalms by means of ten elders,</b> whom the <i>baraita</i> proceeds to list. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>let it also count Ethan the Ezrahite</b> among the contributors to the book of Psalms, as it is he who is credited with Psalms, chapter 89. <b>Rav says: Ethan the Ezrahite is</b> the same person as <b>Abraham.</b> Proof for this is the fact that <b>it is written here:</b> “A Maskil of <b>Ethan the Ezrahite”</b> (Psalms 89:1), <b>and it is written there: “Who raised up one from the east [<i>mizraḥ</i>], whom righteousness</b> met wherever he set his foot” (Isaiah 41:2). The latter verse is understood as referring to Abraham, who came from the east, and for that reason he is called Ethan the Ezrahite in the former verse.",
    "The Gemara asks: The <i>baraita</i> <b>counts Moses</b> among the ten elders whose works are included in the book of Psalms, <b>and it</b> also <b>counts Heman. But doesn’t Rav say:</b> The <b>Heman</b> mentioned in the Bible (I Kings 5:11) <b>is</b> the same person as <b>Moses?</b> This is proven by the fact that <b>it is written here: “Heman”</b> (Psalms 88:1), which is Aramaic for trusted, <b>and it is written there</b> about Moses: <b>“For he is the trusted one in all My house”</b> (Numbers 12:7). The Gemara answers: <b>There were two Hemans,</b> one of whom was Moses, and the other a Temple singer from among the descendants of Samuel.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> further states that <b>Moses wrote his own book,</b> i.e., the Torah, <b>the portion of Balaam, and</b> the book of <b>Job. This supports Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma, as Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma says: Job</b> lived <b>in the time of Moses. It is written here</b> with regard to Job: <b>“Oh, that my words were written now [<i>eifo</i>]”</b> (Job 19:23), <b>and it is written there</b> in Moses’ words to God: <b>“For in what shall it be known here [<i>eifo</i>]”</b> (Exodus 33:16). The unusual use of the word <i>eifo</i> in these two places indicates that Job and Moses lived in the same generation.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> if that is the proof, <b>say</b> that Job lived <b>in the time of Isaac, as it is written</b> in connection with Isaac: <b>“Who then [<i>eifo</i>] is he that has taken venison”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Jacob, as it is written</b> with respect to Jacob: <b>“If it must be so now [<i>eifo</i>], do this”</b> (Genesis 43:11). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Joseph, as it is written</b> with respect to Joseph: “Tell me, I pray you, <b>where [<i>eifo</i>] are they feeding their flocks?”</b> (Genesis 37:16).",
    "The Gemara answers: It could <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written</b> in the continuation of the previously mentioned verse: <b>“Oh, that</b> my words <b>were inscribed [<i>veyuḥaku</i>] in a book”</b> (Job 19:23), <b>and it is Moses who is called the inscriber, as it is written</b> with regard to him: <b>“And he provided the first part for himself, for there was the inscriber’s [<i>meḥokek</i>] portion reserved”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:21).",
    "<b>Rava says: Job</b> lived <b>at the time of the spies</b> whom Moses sent to scout the land of Canaan. This is proven by the fact that <b>it is written here: “There was a man in the land of Utz, whose name was Job”</b> (Job 1:1), <b>and it is written there</b> in the account of the spies: <b>“Whether there are trees [<i>eitz</i>] in it”</b> (Numbers 13:20). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it comparable? Here</b> the word that is used is <b><i>Utz</i>,</b> whereas <b>there</b> the word is <b><i>eitz</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is what Moses said to Israel,</b> i.e., to the spies: <b>Is that man</b> named Job still alive, <b>he whose years are as long as</b> the years <b>of a tree and who protects his generation like a tree?</b> This is why the allusion to him here is through the word <i>eitz</i>, rather than <i>Utz</i>.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>one of the Sages sat before Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani and he sat and said: Job never existed and was never created;</b> there was never such a person as Job. <b>Rather,</b> his story <b>was a parable.</b> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <b>said to him:</b> In rebuttal <b>to you, the verse states: “There was a man in the Land of Utz whose name was Job”</b> (Job 1:1), which indicates that such a man did indeed exist.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so,</b> that the words “there was” prove that Job existed, what shall we say about the parable that Natan the prophet presented to David: “There were two men in one city; the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had very many flocks and herds, <b>but the poor man had nothing except one little lamb, which he had bought and reared”</b> (II Samuel 12:3)? <b>Was there</b> really such a person? <b>Rather, it was merely a parable; here too it is merely a parable.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that it is a parable, <b>why</b> state <b>his name and the name of his city?</b> Rather, Job was clearly a real person.",
    "The Gemara cites another opinion with regard to the time when Job lived. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: Job was among those who ascended from the exile</b> to Eretz Yisrael at the start of the Second Temple period, <b>and his house of study was in Tiberias.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The days of Job’s life</b> extended <b>from when Israel entered Egypt until they left,</b> indicating that this is the period during which he lived and not, as suggested, in the early days of the Second Temple."
