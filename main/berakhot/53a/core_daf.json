    "<b>If we say</b> that did not rest means that <b>it did not rest from labor, even from labor that is permitted? Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>over light</b> that was kindled on Shabbat <b>for a woman giving birth or a</b> dangerously <b>ill person,</b> for whom one is permitted to perform prohibited labor on Shabbat, <b>one may recite a blessing</b> during <i>havdala</i> at the conclusion of Shabbat?",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What is</b> meant by <b>rested?</b> Light <b>that rested from labor of transgression</b> on Shabbat. However, if the light burned for the entire Shabbat or was kindled on Shabbat in a permissible manner, one may recite a blessing over it. <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A lantern that was continuously burning throughout the entire day</b> of Shabbat, <b>one may recite a blessing over it at the conclusion of Shabbat.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A gentile who lit</b> a candle <b>from</b> a candle that was in the possession of <b>a Jew or if a Jew lit</b> a candle <b>from a gentile, one may recite a blessing over it</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat. However, <b>if a gentile</b> lit a candle <b>from a gentile, one may not recite a blessing over it.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a candle that <b>a gentile</b> lit <b>from a gentile, that</b> one may <b>not</b> recite a blessing over it? <b>Because</b> the light <b>did not rest</b> on Shabbat. <b>If so,</b> the light of <b>a Jew</b> who lit a candle <b>from a gentile also did not rest</b> on Shabbat.",
    "<b>And if you say</b> that <b>this prohibited</b> flame <b>has gone and this</b> flame <b>is a</b> new and <b>different</b> one which <b>came into being in the possession of a Jew,</b> as a flame is not a concrete, static object, but rather it constantly recreates itself; <b>however, this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> in tractate <i>Shabbat</i> states: <b>One who carries out a flame</b> from the private <b>to the public domain</b> on Shabbat <b>is liable</b> for carrying out from one domain to another. If the flame is constantly recreating itself, <b>why is he liable? That</b> flame <b>which he lifted</b> from the private domain <b>he did not place</b> in the public domain <b>and that which he placed he did not lift.</b> One is only liable for carrying out on Shabbat if he lifted an object from one domain and placed that same object in another domain. Since one who carries out a flame on Shabbat is considered liable, evidently, despite any change that it may undergo, the flame is essentially considered a single entity.",
    "<b>Rather, actually that prohibited</b> flame <b>is also extant, and when one recites the blessing, he recites the blessing over the permitted addition</b> to that flame. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> even if <b>a gentile</b> lit a candle <b>from a gentile as well,</b> the flame should be considered essentially new; one should be able to recite a blessing over the addition.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so.</b> Fundamentally, there is no reason to prohibit doing so. However, the Sages issued <b>a decree because of the first gentile,</b> who did not light the flame from another gentile, <b>and the first pillar</b> of flame that was kindled on Shabbat. Consequently, they prohibited all somewhat similar cases, including when a gentile lights a flame from another gentile.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one was walking outside the city, saw fire</b> there, and wanted to recite the blessing over it as part of <i>havdala</i>, <b>if</b> the city has a <b>majority of gentiles he may not recite the blessing</b> over the fire, but <b>if</b> the city has a <b>majority of Jews, he may recite the blessing.</b>",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>The matter itself is difficult</b> in this <i>baraita</i>. <b>You said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that if the town has a <b>majority of gentiles he may not recite the blessing.</b> By inference, if the town population was <b>half</b> gentiles <b>and half</b> Jews, <b>one may recite a blessing. And then you teach</b> that <b>if</b> the town has a <b>majority of Jews, he may recite the blessing.</b> By inference, if the town population was <b>half</b> gentiles <b>and half</b> Jews, <b>one may not recite a blessing.</b> The inferences from two sections of the <i>baraita</i> are contradictory.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>By right,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should have taught that <b>even</b> if the town population was <b>half</b> gentiles <b>and half</b> Jews, <b>one may recite a blessing,</b> but <b>since in the first clause it taught: The majority of gentiles, in the latter clause it</b> used the same expression and <b>taught: The majority of Jews.</b>",
    "And <b>the Sages taught: One who was walking outside the city</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat <b>and saw a child with a torch in his hand, he</b> must <b>check after his</b> background. <b>If</b> the child <b>is a Jew, he may recite a blessing</b> over this flame, <b>but if</b> the child <b>is a gentile, he may not recite a blessing</b> over it.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Why was it taught</b> specifically with regard to <b>a child? Even if he were an adult,</b> one would <b>also</b> need to investigate whether he was a Jew or a gentile in order to determine whether or not he may recite a blessing over the torch.",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case where, although it was the conclusion of Shabbat, it was still <b>soon after sunset.</b> Therefore, in the case of <b>an adult, it is self-evident that he is a gentile,</b> as a Jew would not be so quick to take fire in his hand immediately after Shabbat. In the case of <b>a child,</b> however, <b>say that</b> perhaps <b>he is a Jew</b> and <b>it happened that he took</b> the torch.",
    "And <b>the Sages taught: One who was walking outside the city</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat <b>and saw a fire, if</b> the fire <b>is</b> at least <b>as thick as the opening of a furnace, one may recite a blessing over it,</b> as a fire of that kind is kindled for the light it produces as well. <b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> at least that thick, <b>one may not recite a blessing over it.</b>",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: During <i>havdala</i>, <b>one may recite a blessing over the fire of a furnace; and it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite a blessing over</b> the fire of a furnace. There is an apparent contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i>.",
    "The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing is speaking <b>at the beginning</b> when the furnace was just kindled and the fire is designated solely to heat the objects in the furnace; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking <b>at the end,</b> when the fire is no longer needed to heat the objects in the furnace, and its light is used for other purposes.",
    "The Gemara cites a similar contradiction between <i>baraitot</i>: <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: During <i>havdala</i>, <b>one may recite a blessing over the fire of an oven or a stove; and it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite a blessing over it.</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as a similar distinction between the <i>baraitot</i> may be suggested. <b>This</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing, is speaking <b>at the beginning,</b> when the oven or stove was just kindled and the fire is designated solely to heat the objects on the stove or in the oven; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking <b>at the end,</b> when the fire is no longer needed to heat the objects on the stove or in the oven and its light is used for other purposes.",
    "The Gemara cites another contradiction: <b>It was taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: During <i>havdala</i>, <b>one may recite a blessing over the light of a synagogue or a study hall; and it was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite a blessing over it.</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is an important person</b> in the synagogue and the fire is kindled in his honor and not to provide light; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is no important person</b> present and the fire is kindled to provide light.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> are speaking in a case <b>where there is an important person</b> present in the synagogue, <b>and</b> this is <b>not difficult</b> because the contradiction can be resolved as follows: <b>This</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is a caretaker</b> in the synagogue who uses the light; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is no caretaker</b> and the light is kindled for purposes of honor.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are both referring to a case <b>where there is a caretaker</b> present in the synagogue, <b>and</b> this is <b>not difficult</b> because the contradiction can be resolved as follows: <b>This</b> <i>baraita,</i> which prohibits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is moonlight,</b> so the caretaker did not light the fire to provide light as the moonlight is sufficient; <b>that</b> <i>baraita,</i> which permits reciting the blessing, is speaking in a case <b>where there is no moonlight,</b> and the caretaker lights the fire to provide light.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>People were seated in the study hall and they brought fire before them</b> at the conclusion of Shabbat. <b>Beit Shammai say: Each and every individual recites a blessing for himself; and Beit Hillel say: One recites a blessing on behalf of everyone</b> and the others answer amen. Beit Hillel’s reasoning is <b>as it is stated: “The splendor of the King is in the multitude of the people”</b> (Proverbs 14:28). When everyone joins together to hear the blessing, the name of God is glorified.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Beit Hillel,</b> they <b>explain</b> their <b>reasoning, but what is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Beit Shammai</b> to prohibit reciting the blessing communally? The Gemara answers: <b>They hold</b> that it is prohibited <b>due to</b> the fact that it will lead to <b>suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall.</b> Waiting for someone to recite the blessing will interrupt Torah study for several minutes.",
    "<b>This</b> concern for disrupting Torah study <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The members of <b>the house of Rabban Gamliel would not say good health</b> when someone sneezed <b>in the study hall, due to</b> the fact that it would lead to <b>suspension of</b> study in <b>the study hall.</b>",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>One may neither recite a blessing over the candle nor over the spices</b> designated to honor <b>the dead.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason?</b> Because <b>a candle</b> of the dead <b>is kindled for</b> the purpose of <b>honoring</b> the dead, not for light; <b>the spices</b> are <b>to neutralize the</b> bad <b>odor,</b> not for their pleasant fragrance.",
    "And <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Any</b> deceased <b>before whom</b> a candle <b>is taken out</b> both <b>by day and by night,</b> it is evident that the candle is for the purpose of honoring the deceased; therefore, <b>one may not recite a blessing over it. And any</b> deceased <b>before whom</b> a candle <b>is taken out only by night,</b> it is evident that the purpose of the candle is for its light alone, and <b>one may recite a blessing over it.</b>",
    "Similarly, <b>Rav Huna said: Over spices</b> used to deodorize <b>the bathroom and</b> fragrant <b>oil</b> intended <b>to remove filth, one may not recite a blessing</b> as they are not used for their pleasant fragrance.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>any</b> case <b>where it is not used for its</b> pleasant <b>fragrance, one may not recite a blessing over it?</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who enters the store of a perfumer, and smelled a fragrance, even if he sat there throughout the entire day, he only recites a blessing once.</b> However, <b>if one entered and exited, entered and exited, he recites a blessing on each and every occasion. Isn’t</b> it a case <b>here, where</b> the spices <b>are not intended for fragrance,</b> as they are not used to improve the scent in the store, <b>and,</b> nevertheless, <b>one recites a blessing?</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> in this case the spices <b>are also intended for fragrance;</b> they are used to generate a scent in the store <b>so that people will smell</b> them <b>and come and purchase from him.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was walking outside a city and smelled a scent; if the majority</b> of the town’s residents <b>are gentiles he may not recite a blessing</b> over the scent, but <b>if the majority are Jews, he may recite a blessing. Rabbi Yosei says: Even if the majority are Jews, one may not recite a blessing, as the daughters of Israel burn incense to witchcraft</b> and the spices were certainly made for witchcraft, not for their fragrance.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that they all burn incense to witchcraft?</b> Rather, <b>there is a minority</b> of people who burn incense <b>to witchcraft, and a</b> different <b>minority</b> who burn spices in order <b>to perfume</b> their <b>garments with incense. A majority,</b> therefore, exists that <b>does not use it for fragrance, and in a case where the majority does not use it for fragrance, one does not recite a blessing.</b>",
    "Similarly, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who walks on Shabbat eve in Tiberias</b> or <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat in Tzippori, and smelled the scent</b> of incense <b>may not recite a blessing, as the presumption is</b> that <b>it was intended to perfume garments.</b>",
    "On a related note, the Gemara cites the following: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was walking in the marketplace of idolators and willingly smelled</b> the incense wafting there, <b>he is a sinner,</b> as he should not have the intention to smell it."
