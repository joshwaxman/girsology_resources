    "<b>“Which I command you this day, will be upon your heart.”</b> Surely the word these, does not come to limit the mitzva of intent. On the contrary, <b>from here you derive that the entire portion requires intent.</b>",
    "<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva;</b> the entire portion requires intent.",
    "<b>Some teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> stated by Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>with regard to that which was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>, where there is a tannaitic dispute. The first <i>tanna</i> holds: <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> must focus his heart</b> for the entire <i>Shema</i>. <b>Rabbi Aḥa says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda: Once he focused his heart for the first paragraph</b> alone, <b>he no longer requires</b> intent. With regard to this <i>Tosefta</i>, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Aḥa who said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> While this differs from the previous version in form, it arrives at the same conclusion.",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> on this subject, which cited different opinions. From: <b>And they will be,</b> recited in <i>Shema</i>, it is derived that <b>it may not be recited out of order.</b> From: <b>Upon your heart, Rav Zutra says: To this point,</b> there is <b>the mitzva of intent; from here on,</b> beginning with the second paragraph, there is only <b>the mitzva of recitation. Rabbi Yoshiya says</b> that it means the opposite: <b>To this point,</b> there is <b>the mitzva of recitation; from here on</b> there is only <b>the mitzva of intent.</b>",
    "At first the Gemara understands that Rav Zutra required recitation only in the second paragraph, while in the first paragraph only intent was required. Therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>What is different,</b> that <b>from here on,</b> beginning with the second paragraph, there is <b>the mitzva of recitation?</b> Is it because <b>it is written:</b> “And you shall teach them to your children, <b>to speak of them”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19)? This is no proof, as <b>here too,</b> in the first paragraph <b>it is written: “And you shall speak of them.”</b> The mitzva of recitation applies to the first paragraph as well.",
    "Rather, <b>he is saying as follows: To this point</b> there is <b>the mitzva of</b> both <b>intent and recitation,</b> but <b>from here on,</b> there is only the mitzva of <b>recitation without intent.</b>",
    "Again the Gemara asks: According to Rav Zutra, <b>what is different,</b> that <b>to this point,</b> in the first paragraph, there is <b>the mitzva of</b> both <b>intent and recitation</b> because there are two requirements in the first paragraph, <b>as it is written: “Upon your heart…and you shall speak of them”? There, too,</b> in the second paragraph <b>it is also written: “And you shall place these words upon your heart…to speak of them,”</b> indicating that intent is also required in that paragraph.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>That verse is necessary to derive</b> that which was taught by <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said: “And you shall place these words”</b> refers literally to the paragraphs of <i>Shema</i> found in the phylacteries. The verse teaches <b>that the placement</b> of the phylacteries of the arm <b>must be opposite the heart.</b>",
    "The Gemara now attempts to clarify the second opinion in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said, Rabbi Yoshiya says: To this point</b> at the end of the first paragraph, there is <b>the mitzva of recitation; from here on</b> there is <b>the mitzva of intent.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different,</b> that <b>from here on,</b> beginning with the second paragraph, there is <b>the mitzva of intent?</b> Is it <b>because it is written</b> in the second paragraph: “And you shall place these words <b>upon your heart”?</b> That is no proof, as <b>here too,</b> in the first paragraph <b>it is written: “Upon your heart.”</b>",
    "The Gemara responds that <b>he is saying as follows: To this point,</b> there is <b>the mitzva of</b> both <b>recitation and intent,</b> but <b>from here on,</b> there is only the mitzva of <b>intent without recitation.</b>",
    "The Gemara continues: <b>And what is different,</b> that <b>to this point,</b> in the first paragraph, there is <b>the mitzva of recitation and intent</b> because there are two requirements, <b>as it is written: Upon your heart</b> as well as: <b>And you shall speak of them? There, too,</b> with regard to the second paragraph <b>isn’t it written:</b> And you shall place these words <b>upon your heart</b>…and you shall teach them to your children, <b>to speak of them?</b>",
    "Rabbi Yoshiya responded: <b>That</b> verse refers to <b>Torah study</b> in general, not to the recitation of <i>Shema</i> in particular. <b>And the Torah says the following: Teach your children Torah, that they will be well-versed in them.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> with regard to one who recites <i>Shema</i> and utters the verse, <b>“Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One.” Intent of the heart is</b> only <b>required to this point.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rava said:</b> In this matter, <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>Sumakhos says: One who extends</b> his intonation <b>of</b> the word <b>One [<i>eḥad</i>]</b> while reciting <i>Shema</i>, is rewarded that <b>his days and years are extended. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> This is only true if he extends <b>the</b> letter <b><i>dalet</i>,</b> so the word <i>eḥad</i> is sounded in its entirety. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is <b>only so long as one does not</b> pronounce the letter <b><i>ḥet</i> hurriedly.</b>",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was seated before Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. He saw that he was greatly extending</b> his pronunciation of <i>eḥad</i>. <b>He said to him: Once you have crowned Him</b> in your thoughts <b>over</b> everything <b>above,</b> in Heaven, <b>below,</b> on earth, <b>and in the four corners of the heavens, you need not</b> extend any <b>further.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Natan bar Mar Ukva said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> One must recite <b>upon your heart, while standing</b> in one place. The Gemara is perplexed: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that <b>upon your heart</b> alone must be recited while standing in one place? What distinguishes that phrase from the rest of <i>Shema</i>? <b>Rather, say:</b> One must recite <b>until upon your heart</b> while <b>standing</b> in one place. <b>From here on,</b> one need <b>not</b> stand in one place. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> One must recite <b>the entire</b> first <b>portion</b> while <b>standing</b> in one place.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is consistent <b>and follows his reasoning</b> expressed elsewhere, as <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa who said in the name of Rabbi Yehuda;</b> one is required to recite the entire first paragraph of <i>Shema</i> with intent.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The single verse, <b>“Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One”; this is Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s recitation of <i>Shema</i>.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav said to</b> his uncle, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya: I did not see Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>accept the kingship of Heaven upon himself,</b> meaning that he did not see him recite <i>Shema</i>. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: Son of noblemen [<i>bar paḥtei</i></b>], <b>when</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>passed his hands over his face</b> in the study hall in the middle of his lesson, <b>he accepted the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven upon himself,</b> as his <i>Shema</i> was comprised of a single verse.",
    "Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s students and members of his household disputed: <b>Does he complete</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>later or does he not complete it later? Bar Kappara says: He does not complete it later. Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>says: He completes it later. Bar Kappara said to Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Granted, according to my</b> position, <b>that I say that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not complete</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>later, that is why</b> when he taught, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would specifically <b>seek a topic that included the exodus from Egypt,</b> as by so doing he fulfills the mitzva to remember the Exodus; a mitzva that others fulfill in their recitation of the last paragraph of <i>Shema</i>. <b>But according to you, who says that he completes</b> his recitation of <i>Shema</i> <b>later, why,</b> when he teaches, <b>would</b> he specifically <b>seek</b> a topic that included the exodus from Egypt?",
    "Rabbi Shimon responded: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did so <b>in order to mention the exodus from Egypt at its</b> appointed <b>time,</b> during the time of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>.",
    "Based on this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Ila, son of Rav Shmuel bar Marta, said in the name of Rav: One who recited</b> the verse, <b>“Hear, Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One,” and was</b> immediately <b>overcome by sleep, fulfilled</b> his obligation to recite <i>Shema</i>. Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman said to his slave, Daru:</b> If you see that I have fallen asleep, <b>bother me</b> to recite <b>the first verse, do not bother me</b> to recite any <b>more</b> than that. Similarly, <b>Rav Yosef said to Rav Yosef, son of Rabba: What would your father do?</b> Rav Yosef, son of Rabba, <b>said to him: He would exert himself</b> not to fall asleep in order to recite <b>the first verse, he would not exert himself</b> to recite any <b>more</b> than that.",
    "<b>Rav Yosef said: One who is lying [<i>perakdan</i>] on his back may not recite <i>Shema</i>,</b> for lying that way is unbecoming. The Gemara asks: Is that to say that <b>one may not recite</b> <i>Shema</i> in this position, <b>but to</b> sleep <b>lying</b> in that position <b>is permissible? Didn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi curse one who</b> sleeps <b>lying on his back?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>If one</b> lies on his back <b>while leaning</b> slightly to the side, <b>it is permissible.</b> Nonetheless, <b>to recite</b> <i>Shema</i> in this position, <b>even though he is leaning, is prohibited.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Wouldn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> lie on his back, <b>lean</b> slightly <b>and recite</b> <i>Shema</i>?",
    "The Gemara responds: The case of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan is different,</b> because <b>he was corpulent</b> and it was difficult for him to read any other way.",
    "The mishna cited Rabbi Meir’s statement: <b>At the</b> breaks between <b>paragraphs, one may greet</b> an individual due to the respect that he is obligated to show him, and may respond. And in the middle of each paragraph, one may greet an individual due to the fear that the individual may harm him if he fails do so, and may respond.",
    "About this, the Gemara asks: He may <b>respond due to what</b> circumstance? <b>If you say</b> that one may respond <b>due to respect; now that</b> we learned that <b>one may greet</b> another due to respect, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that <b>one may respond</b> due to respect? <b>Rather,</b> it must be explained as follows: <b>One may greet due to respect and respond with a greeting to any person.</b> But if that is the case, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>In the middle</b> of each paragraph <b>one may greet due to fear and return</b> another’s greeting due to fear.",
    "Here too, it must be clarified: He may <b>respond due to what</b> circumstance? <b>If you say</b> that one may respond <b>due to fear; now that</b> we have learned that <b>one may greet</b> another due to fear, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that <b>one may respond</b> due to fear? <b>Rather,</b> it must mean that one may respond to another’s greeting even <b>due to honor.</b> If so, <b>that is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>In the middle</b> of each paragraph, <b>one may greet</b> another <b>due to fear and respond due to respect. At the</b> breaks between <b>paragraphs, one may greet</b> another <b>due to respect and respond with a greeting to any person.</b> If so, what is the dispute between them?",
    "The Gemara says: The mishna <b>is incomplete;</b> it is missing an important element, <b>and it teaches the following: At the</b> breaks between the <b>paragraphs, one may greet due to respect, and, needless to say, he may respond</b> due to respect. <b>In the middle</b> of each paragraph <b>one may greet due to fear, and, needless to say, he may respond</b> due to fear. This is the <b>statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: In the middle</b> of each paragraph <b>one may greet due to fear and respond due to respect.</b>"
