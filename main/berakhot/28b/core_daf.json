    "After mentioning until when the additional prayer may be recited, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Avya was ill and did not come to Rav Yosef’s Shabbat lecture. When</b> Rav Avya <b>came the following day, Abaye sought to placate Rav Yosef,</b> and through a series of questions and answers sought to make clear to him that Rav Avya’s failure to attend the lecture was not a display of contempt for Rav Yosef. <br>To this end, he asked him: <b>Why did the Master not attend the Shabbat lecture?</b> <br>Rav Avya <b>said to him: Because my heart was faint and I was unable</b> to attend. <br>Abaye <b>said to him: Why did you not eat something and come?</b> <br>Rav Avya <b>said to him:</b> Does <b>the Master not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> statement <b>of Rav Huna? As Rav Huna said: A person may not taste anything before he recites the additional prayer.</b> <br>Abaye <b>said to him: My Master should have recited the additional prayer individually, eaten something, and</b> then <b>come</b> to the lecture. <br>Rav Avya <b>said to him:</b> Does <b>my Master not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan: A person may not recite his</b> individual <b>prayer prior to the communal prayer?</b> <br>Abaye <b>said to him:</b> Was <b>it not stated regarding this</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Abba said: They taught</b> this <b>in a communal</b> setting? <br>In other words, only one who is part of a congregation is prohibited from praying alone prior to the prayer of the congregation. Even though Rav Avya was incorrect, the reason for his failure to attend the lecture was clarified through this discussion.",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara summarizes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is neither in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Huna nor in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.</b> The Gemara explains: It is not <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Huna, as we said</b> above with regard to the prohibition to eat prior to the additional prayer. It is not <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Once the time</b> to recite <b>the afternoon prayer has arrived, a person may not taste anything before he recites the afternoon prayer.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In addition to the <i>halakhot</i> relating to the fixed prayers, the Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben Hakana would recite a brief prayer upon his entrance into the study hall and upon his exit. They said to him:</b> The study hall is not a dangerous place that would warrant a prayer when entering and exiting, so <b>what room is there for this prayer? He said to them: Upon my entrance, I pray that no mishap will transpire</b> caused <b>by me</b> in the study hall. <b>And upon my exit, I give thanks for my portion.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> the complete formula of Rabbi Neḥunya ben Hakana’s prayer: <b>Upon his entrance, what does he say? May it be Your will, Lord my God, that no mishap</b> in determining the <i>halakha</i> <b>transpires</b> caused <b>by me, and that I not fail in any matter of <i>halakha</i>, and that my colleagues,</b> who together with me engage in clarifying the <i>halakha,</i> <b>will rejoice in me.</b> He specified: <b>And that I will neither declare pure that which is impure, nor</b> declare <b>impure that which is pure and that my colleagues will not fail in any matter of <i>halakha</i>, and that I will rejoice in them.</b>",
    "<b>Upon his exit, what did he say? I give thanks before You, Lord my God, that You have placed my lot among those who sit in the study hall, and that you have not given me my portion among those who sit</b> idly <b>on</b> street <b>corners. I rise early, and they rise early. I rise early to</b> pursue <b>matters of Torah, and they rise early to</b> pursue <b>frivolous matters. I toil and they toil. I toil and receive a reward, and they toil and do not receive a reward. I run and they run. I run to the life of the World-to-Come and they run to the pit of destruction.</b>",
    "On a similar note, the Gemara recounts related stories with different approaches. <b>The Sages taught: When Rabbi Eliezer fell ill, his students entered to visit him. They said to him: Teach us paths of life,</b> guidelines by which to live, <b>and we will thereby merit the life of the World-to-Come.</b>",
    "<b>He said to them: Be vigilant in the honor of your counterparts, and prevent your children from logic</b> when studying verses that tend toward heresy (<i>ge</i>’<i>onim</i>), <b>and place</b> your children, while they are still young, <b>between the knees of Torah scholars, and when you pray, know before Whom you stand. For</b> doing <b>that, you will merit the life of the World-to-Come.</b>",
    "A similar story is told about Rabbi Eliezer’s mentor, Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: When <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Zakkai fell ill his students entered to visit him. When he saw them, he began to cry. His students said to him: Lamp of Israel, the right pillar, the mighty hammer,</b> the man whose life’s work is the foundation of the future of the Jewish people, <b>for what</b> reason <b>are you crying?</b> With a life as complete as yours, what is upsetting you?",
    "<b>He said to them:</b> I cry in fear of heavenly judgment, as the judgment of the heavenly court is unlike the judgment of man. <b>If they were leading me before a flesh and blood king</b> whose life is temporal, <b>who is here today and</b> dead <b>in the grave tomorrow; if he is angry with me, his anger is not eternal</b> and, consequently, his punishment is not eternal; <b>if he incarcerates me, his incarceration is not an eternal incarceration,</b> as I might maintain my hope that I would ultimately be freed. <b>If he kills me, his killing is not for eternity,</b> as there is life after any death that he might decree. Moreover, <b>I am able to appease him with words and</b> even <b>bribe him with money,</b> and <b>even so I would cry</b> when standing before royal judgment. <b>Now that they are leading me before the supreme King of Kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He, Who lives and endures forever and all time; if He is angry with me, His anger is eternal; if He incarcerates me, His incarceration is an eternal incarceration; and if He kills me, His killing is for eternity. I am unable to appease Him with words and bribe him with money. Moreover, but I have two paths before me, one of the Garden of Eden and one of Gehenna, and I do not know on which they are leading me; and will I not cry?</b>",
    "His students <b>said to him: Our teacher, bless us. He said to them: May it be</b> His <b>will that the fear of Heaven shall be upon you like the fear of flesh and blood. His students</b> were puzzled <b>and said: To that point</b> and not beyond? Shouldn’t one fear God more? <b>He said to them: Would that</b> a person achieve that level of fear. <b>Know that when one commits a transgression, he says</b> to himself: I hope <b>that no man will see me.</b> If one is as concerned about avoiding shame before God as he is before man, he will never sin.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>at the time of his death,</b> immediately beforehand, <b>he said to them: Remove the vessels</b> from the house and take them outside <b>due to the ritual impurity</b> that will be imparted by my corpse, which they would otherwise contract. <b>And prepare a chair for Hezekiah, the King of Judea, who is coming</b> from the upper world to accompany me.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna cites a dispute with regard to the obligation to recite the <i>Amida</i> prayer, also known as <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, the prayer of eighteen blessings, or simply as <i>tefilla</i>, prayer. <b>Rabban Gamliel says: Each and every day a person recites the</b> prayer of <b>eighteen blessings. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> A short prayer is sufficient, and one only recites <b>an abridged</b> version of the prayer of <b>eighteen blessings. Rabbi Akiva says</b> an intermediate opinion: <b>If he is fluent in his prayer, he recites the</b> prayer of <b>eighteen blessings, and if not,</b> he need only recite <b>an abridged</b> version of the prayer of <b>eighteen blessings.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One whose prayer is fixed, his prayer is not supplication</b> and is flawed. The Gemara will clarify the halakhic implications of this flaw.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: One who</b> cannot recite a complete prayer because he <b>is walking in a place of danger, recites a brief prayer and says: Redeem, Lord, Your people, the remnant of Israel, at every transition [<i>parashat ha’ibur</i>],</b> the meaning of which will be discussed in the Gemara. <b>May their needs be before You. Blessed are You, Lord, Who listens to prayer.</b>",
    "While praying, one must face toward the direction of the Holy Temple. <b>One who was riding on a donkey should dismount and pray</b> calmly. <b>If he is unable to dismount, he should turn his face</b> toward the direction of the Temple. <b>If he is unable to turn his face,</b> it is sufficient that <b>he focus his heart opposite the Holy of Holies.</b> Similarly, <b>one who was traveling in a ship or on a raft [<i>asda</i>]</b> and is unable to turn and face in the direction of Jerusalem, <b>should focus his heart opposite the Holy of Holies.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Since the mishna deals with the fundamental obligation to recite the <i>Amida</i> prayer, the Gemara seeks to resolve fundamental problems pertaining to this prayer. <b>Corresponding to what were these eighteen</b> blessings instituted? When the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> was instituted by the Sages, on what did they base the number of blessings?",
    "<b>Rabbi Hillel, son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, said: Corresponding to the eighteen mentions of God’s name</b> that King <b>David said</b> in the psalm: <b>“Give unto the Lord, O you sons of might”</b> (Psalms 29). <b>Rav Yosef said: Corresponding to the eighteen mentions of God’s name in <i>Shema</i>. Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Corresponding to the eighteen vertebrae in the spine</b> beneath the ribs.",
    "Since Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi’s opinion based the <i>Amida</i> prayer on the spinal vertebrae, the Gemara cites another statement of his that connects the two: <b>Rabbi Tanḥum said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> In those blessings where one is required to bow, <b>one who prays must bow until all the vertebrae in the spine protrude.</b>",
    "Establishing a different indicator to determine when he has bowed sufficiently, <b>Ulla said:</b> Until <b>he can see a small coin [<i>issar</i>],</b> on the ground before him <b>opposite his heart</b> (Rav Hai Gaon). <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> There is room for leniency; <b>once he moves his head</b> forward, <b>he need not</b> bow any further. <b>Rava said: But that</b> applies only if <b>he is exerting himself</b> when doing so, <b>and he appears like one who is bowing.</b> However, if he is able, he should bow further.",
    "Until now, the prayer of eighteen blessings has been discussed as if it was axiomatic. The Gemara wonders: Are <b>these eighteen</b> blessings? <b>They are nineteen.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Levi said: The blessing of the heretics,</b> which curses informers, <b>was instituted in Yavne</b> and is not included in the original tally of blessings. Nevertheless, since the number of blessings corresponds to various allusions, the Gemara attempts to clarify: <b>Corresponding to what was</b> this nineteenth blessing <b>instituted?</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Levi said: According to Rabbi Hillel, son of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani,</b> who said that the eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen mentions of God’s name that King David said in the psalm, the nineteenth blessing <b>corresponds to</b> a reference to God in that psalm, where a name other than the tetragrammaton was used: <b>“The God of glory thunders” (</b>Psalms 29:3). <b>According to Rav Yosef,</b> who said that the eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen mentions of God’s name in <i>Shema</i>, the additional blessing <b>corresponds to</b> the word <b>one that is in <i>Shema</i>.</b> Although it is not the tetragrammaton, it expresses the essence of faith in God. <b>According to</b> what <b>Rabbi Tanḥum</b> said that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said,</b> that the eighteen blessings correspond to the eighteen vertebrae in the spine, the additional blessing <b>corresponds to the small vertebra that is</b> at the bottom <b>of the spine.</b>",
    "In light of the previous mention of the blessing of the heretics, the Gemara explains how this blessing was instituted: <b>The Sages taught: Shimon HaPakuli arranged</b> the <b>eighteen blessings,</b> already extant during the period of the Great Assembly, <b>before Rabban Gamliel,</b> the <i>Nasi</i> of the Sanhedrin, <b>in order in Yavne.</b> Due to prevailing circumstances, there was a need to institute a new blessing directed against the heretics. <b>Rabban Gamliel said to the Sages: Is there any person who knows to institute the blessing of the heretics,</b> a blessing directed against the Sadducees? <b>Shmuel HaKatan,</b> who was one of the most pious men of that generation, <b>stood and instituted it.</b>",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>The next year,</b> when Shmuel HaKatan served as the prayer leader, <b>he forgot</b> that blessing,"
