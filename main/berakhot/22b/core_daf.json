    "<b>that</b> this problem was raised <b>in Rav Oshaya’s chamber,</b> and <b>they came and asked Rav Asi. He said to them: They only stated</b> the obligation to pour water over one who is impure because of a seminal emission <b>with regard to a sick person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission, <b>but a sick person who experienced an involuntary</b> seminal emission is clearly <b>exempt from anything</b> and requires no immersion whatsoever. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> In that case, <b>Rav Naḥman’s jug is rejoined,</b> meaning that it is effective with regard to purification.",
    "Up to now, discussion has focused on various problems pertaining to the laws of immersion as they concern one whose impurity is due to seminal emission. The Gemara asks: <b>Since all</b> of the <b><i>amora’im</i> and <i>tanna’im</i> disagree with regard to</b> the decree of <b>Ezra, let us examine how Ezra instituted</b> this ordinance, as this is not an uncommon circumstance and we can see how they conducted themselves.",
    "<b>Abaye said: Ezra</b> did not institute a sweeping ordinance concerning every case of one who experienced a seminal emission; rather, he <b>instituted</b> only that <b>a healthy person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission is required to immerse himself in <b>forty <i>se’a</i>, while for a healthy person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission, <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> are sufficient. <b>And the <i>amora’im</i> came and disagreed with regard to a sick person. One Sage held</b> that <b>a sick person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission is considered <b>like a healthy person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission, <b>while a sick person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission is considered <b>like a healthy person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission. <b>However, another Sage maintained</b> that <b>a sick person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission is considered <b>like a healthy person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission, and consequently requires only that nine <i>kav</i> be poured over him, <b>while a sick person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission <b>is exempt from any</b> form of immersion or purification.",
    "<b>Rava said: Although Ezra instituted immersion</b> for one who experienced a seminal emission, <b>did he institute the pouring</b> of nine <b><i>kav</i>? Didn’t the Master say</b> that we have a tradition that <b>Ezra</b> only <b>instituted immersion for those who experienced a seminal emission? Rather, Rava said:</b> We must explain that the diverse opinions developed after Ezra’s decree. <b>Ezra</b> himself <b>instituted immersion in forty <i>se’a</i></b> only <b>for a healthy person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission. <b>And the Sages came and instituted that a healthy person who experienced an involuntary</b> seminal emission should have <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> poured over him. <b>And</b> then <b>the <i>amora’im</i> came and disagreed</b> with regard to <b>a sick person; one Sage held</b> that <b>a sick person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission is considered <b>like a healthy person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission, <b>while a sick person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission is considered <b>like a healthy person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission, <b>another Sage maintained</b> that only <b>a healthy person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission is required to immerse himself in <b>forty <i>se’a</i> while a sick person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission is considered <b>like a healthy person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission, requiring only <b>nine <i>kav</i>. But a sick person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission <b>is exempt from any</b> form of immersion or purification.",
    "<b>Rava stated</b> that <b>the</b> halakhic ruling is in accordance with the first opinion: <b>A healthy person</b> who experienced <b>a normal</b> seminal emission <b>and a sick person</b> who experienced <b>a normal</b> seminal emission require <b>forty <i>se’a</i>, while a healthy person</b> who experienced <b>an involuntary</b> seminal emission suffices with <b>nine <i>kav</i>. But a sick person</b> who experienced <b>an involuntary</b> seminal emission <b>is exempt from</b> undergoing <b>any</b> rite of purification.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>One who experienced a seminal emission and had nine <i>kav</i> of</b> drawn <b>water poured over him is ritually pure. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case involving Torah study <b>for himself, but</b> in order to purify himself that he may teach Torah <b>to others,</b> he must immerse himself in <b>forty <i>se’a</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says: Forty <i>se’a</i></b> is required for purification <b>in any case.</b>",
    "With regard to this issue, a dispute arose between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. One</b> member <b>of this pair and one</b> member <b>of that pair</b> disagreed <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>One said: That which you said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> In a case involving Torah study <b>for himself, but</b> in order to purify himself that he may teach Torah <b>to others,</b> he must immerse himself in <b>forty <i>se’a</i>,</b> was <b>only taught regarding a sick person who experienced a normal</b> seminal emission, <b>but for a sick person</b> who experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission, <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> is sufficient even for teaching others. <b>And one said</b> that <b>anyone</b> who teaches <b>others, even</b> if he was <b>sick</b> and experienced an <b>involuntary</b> seminal emission, is not considered pure <b>until there are forty <i>se’a</i>.</b>",
    "<b>And one</b> member <b>of this pair and one</b> member <b>of that pair</b> disagreed <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the <i>Tosefta</i>. <b>One said: That which Rabbi Yehuda said: Forty <i>se’a</i> in any case, was only taught when</b> the water is in <b>the ground,</b> in accordance with the Torah law of ritual bath, <b>but not</b> if it was collected <b>in vessels. And one said: Even</b> forty <i>se’a</i> collected <b>in vessels</b> are sufficient for purification.",
    "The Gemara clarifies this problem: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that forty <i>se’a</i> purifies <b>even in vessels. That is</b> why the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>taught: Rabbi Yehuda says: Forty <i>se’a</i> in any case. However,</b> according to <b>the one who said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is that forty <i>se’a</i> <b>in the ground, yes,</b> it purifies, but <b>in vessels, no,</b> it does not purify, <b>what</b> does the expression <b>in any case</b> come <b>to include?</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: In any case comes <b>to include drawn water,</b> as Rabbi Yehuda permits immersion in forty <i>se’a</i> of water collected in the ground even if the water was drawn by human hand.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, and Rava bar Shmuel ate bread together. Rav Pappa said to them: Allow me to recite</b> Grace after Meals for the group, as I am ritually pure because <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of water <b>fell upon me;</b> in other words, he poured it over himself. <b>Rava bar Shmuel said to them: We learned, in what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that nine <i>kav</i> purify, <b>said?</b> In a case involving Torah study <b>for himself. But,</b> in order to purify himself that he may teach Torah <b>to others,</b> and by extension to fulfill the obligation of others, he must immerse himself in <b>forty <i>se’a</i>. Rather, allow me to recite</b> Grace after Meals for the group, <b>as forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water <b>fell upon me;</b> in other words, I immersed myself in a ritual bath. <b>Rav Huna said to them: Allow me to recite</b> Grace after Meals for the group, <b>as I have</b> had <b>neither this nor that upon me</b> because I remained ritually pure.",
    "It is also said that <b>Rav Ḥama would immerse himself on Passover eve in order to fulfill the obligations of the masses.</b> However the Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his</b> opinion that distinguishes between the purification for oneself and purification for the sake of others.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna contains various statements with regard to individuals with different types of ritual impurity as well as the need to distance oneself from filth and impurity. <b>One who was standing in prayer and he recalled that he experienced a seminal emission,</b> and according to this opinion he is prohibited from praying, should <b>not interrupt</b> his prayer, <b>rather he should abridge</b> each individual blessing.",
    "They stated a general principle: <b>One who descended to immerse himself, if he is able to ascend, cover himself</b> with a garment, <b>and recite</b> the morning <i>Shema</i> <b>before sunrise, he should ascend, cover himself, and recite</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>and if not,</b> he should <b>cover himself in the water and recite</b> <i>Shema</i> there. <b>He may not, however, cover himself in either foul water, or water</b> in which flax was <b>soaked, until he pours</b> other <b>water into it. And</b> in general, <b>how far must one distance</b> himself <b>from</b> urine <b>and feces</b> in order to recite <i>Shema</i>? At least <b>four cubits.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <i>baraita</i> further elaborates on the first <i>halakha</i> in the mishna. <b>The Sages taught: One who was standing in prayer and he recalled that he</b> had <b>experienced a seminal emission,</b> should <b>not interrupt</b> his prayer. <b>Rather, he should abridge. One who was reading the Torah and recalled that he experienced a seminal emission, does not interrupt</b> his reading, <b>but rather reads quickly</b> with less than perfect diction. <b>Rabbi Meir</b> disagrees and <b>says: One who experienced a seminal emission is not permitted to read more than three verses in the Torah,</b> as one may read no fewer than three verses in the Torah. After he completes three verses, he must stop and let someone else continue.",
    "<b>It was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was standing in prayer and he saw feces before him must walk forward until he has placed it four cubits behind him.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that it is sufficient if he distances himself four cubits <b>to the side?</b> The Gemara resolves this contradiction: <b>This is not difficult,</b> as <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> which taught that it must be four cubits behind him, is referring to a case <b>where it is possible</b> for him to advance that distance, <b>while that</b> <i>baraita</i> which taught that he may distance himself four cubits to the side, is referring to a case <b>where it is not possible</b> to advance four cubits, in which case he must at least step to the side.",
    "The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i>: <b>One who was praying and</b> later <b>found feces in the place</b> where he prayed, <b>Rabba said: Although he committed a transgression</b> in his failure to examine that venue to determine if it was worthy of prayer (<i>Tosafot</i>), <b>his prayer is a</b> valid <b>prayer</b> and he fulfilled his obligation. <b>Rava strongly objects to his</b> statement: <b>Isn’t</b> it stated: <b>“The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination,</b> the more so as he offers it in depravity” (Proverbs 21:27), from which we derive that a mitzva performed inappropriately is no mitzva at all? Consequently, the fact that he did not pay proper attention invalidates his prayer. <b>Rather, Rava said: Because</b> this person <b>committed a transgression, although he prayed, his prayer is an abomination</b> and he must pray again.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was standing in prayer when,</b> for some reason, <b>urine is flowing on his knees, he must interrupt</b> his prayer <b>until the urine ceases, and then resume praying.</b> The Gemara, asks: <b>To where</b> in the prayer <b>does he return</b> when he resumes his prayer? <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rav Hamnuna</b> disagreed; <b>one said: He must return to the beginning</b> of the prayer, <b>and the other said:</b> He must return <b>to</b> the point <b>where he stopped.</b>",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this:</b>"
