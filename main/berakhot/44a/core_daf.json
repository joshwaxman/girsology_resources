    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>they brought salted</b> food <b>before him</b> to eat <b>first and bread with it, he recites a blessing over the salted</b> food <b>and</b> thereby <b>exempts the bread, because</b> the salted food is primary while <b>the bread is secondary to it. This is the principle: Any</b> food <b>that is primary and a secondary</b> food <b>is with it, one recites a blessing over the primary and,</b> in so doing, <b>exempts the secondary</b> from its own blessing.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And is there a</b> circumstance <b>where salted food is primary and bread is secondary?</b> Generally, no meal has a salted food item as its primary component. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avira, said</b> that <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>was taught with regard to those who eat fruits of Genosar,</b> which are extremely sweet and which would be eaten along with salted foods in order to temper this sweetness. They would eat bread along with those salted foods.",
    "On a related note, the Gemara employs hyperbole in praising the fruits of Genosar. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: When we would go after Rabbi Yoḥanan to eat fruits of Genosar, when we were one hundred</b> people together, <b>each and every one of us would bring him ten</b> fruits, <b>and when we were ten</b> people together, <b>each and every one of us would bring him one hundred</b> fruits, <b>and every hundred of</b> the fruits <b>would</b> require a <b>basket of three <i>se’a</i> to hold them.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan would <b>eat them</b> all, <b>and</b> was prepared <b>to swear that he had not tasted</b> any <b>food.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that he claimed that <b>he had not tasted</b> any <b>food? Rather, say</b> that he had not tasted any <b>sustenance.</b> Due to their delicious taste, he was still not satiated.",
    "The Gemara continues to wax hyperbolic: <b>Rabbi Abbahu ate</b> fruits of Genosar <b>until</b> the sweet, lush fruits made his skin so slippery that <b>a fly would slip from his forehead. And Rav Ami and Rav Asi would eat</b> them <b>until their hair fell out. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish would eat them until he became confused. And</b> then <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan would tell the household of the <i>Nasi</i></b> about his condition <b>and Rabbi Yehuda Nesia would send the authorities after him and they would take him to his house.</b>",
    "On a similar note, the Gemara relates: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: King Yannai had a city on the King’s Mountain, from which they would take six-hundred thousand bowls of sardines for those cutting figs</b> off the <b>trees</b> during the course of the week <b>from Shabbat eve to Shabbat eve.</b> There were so many workers, and the fruit was so sweet, that they needed such a vast quantity of salted fish to enable them to continue with their work.",
    "On the subject of the King’s Mountain and Eretz Yisrael, <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: King Yannai had a tree on the King’s Mountain from which they would remove forty <i>se’a</i> of pigeons from three broods each month. When Rabbi Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: There was a city in Eretz Yisrael named Gufnit, in which there were eighty pairs of brothers who were priests, married to eighty pairs of sisters, who were all from priestly</b> families. <b>And</b> to assess the frequency of that phenomenon, the Gemara relates: <b>The Sages checked from Sura to Neharde’a, and with the exception of the daughters of Rav Ḥisda, who were married to Rami bar Ḥama and</b> his brother <b>Mar Ukva bar Ḥama, they could not find</b> a similar case. <b>And,</b> even in the case that they found, <b>although they,</b> the sisters, <b>were</b> the daughters of <b>a priest, they,</b> the brothers <b>were not priests.</b> Throughout virtually the entire country of Babylonia, they could not find a similar circumstance.",
    "On the topic of salted food, <b>Rav said: Any meal in which there is no salt is not</b> considered <b>a meal. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Any meal in which there is no</b> cooked item with <b>gravy</b> (Rashi) <b>is not</b> considered <b>a meal.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who ate</b> from the fruit for which Eretz Yisrael was praised, <b>grapes and figs and pomegranates, recites</b> the <b>three blessings</b> of Grace after Meals, as he would after eating bread; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Gamliel. And the Rabbis say:</b> One need only recite <b>one blessing abridged from</b> the <b>three</b> blessings of Grace after Meals. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The three blessings of Grace after Meals are not restricted to bread; rather, <b>even</b> if <b>one ate boiled vegetables, but it is his</b> primary <b>sustenance, he recites</b> the <b>three blessings</b> of Grace after Meals. Additionally: <b>One who drinks water</b> to quench <b>his thirst recites: By whose word all things came to be. Rabbi Tarfon says:</b> He recites: <b>Who creates the many forms of life and their needs.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Gamliel?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>As it is written</b> in the verse that deals in praise of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“A land of wheat and barley,</b> vines, figs, and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey” (Deuteronomy 8:8), <b>and it is written: “A land in which you will eat bread without scarcity”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:9), <b>and it is written: “And you will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless the Lord your God</b> for the good land He has given you” (Deuteronomy 8:10). Rabban Gamliel concludes from here that the fruits for which Eretz Yisrael was praised are included in the mitzva to recite a blessing after eating. Since that Torah portion alludes to three blessings, fruit also requires three blessings.",
    "<b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> hold? The verse: <b>“A land</b> in which you will eat bread without scarcity,” <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and the mitzva: “You will eat and be satisfied and then you shall bless,” applies only to bread. <b>And</b> if so, according to <b>Rabban Gamliel as well,</b> doesn’t <b>“land” conclude</b> discussion of <b>that matter? Rather, that</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> in order <b>to exclude one who chews</b> raw <b>wheat</b> from the obligation to recite Grace after Meals. Even according to Rabban Gamliel, it does not have the legal status of bread.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Anything that is from the five species</b> of grain, <b>at the start, one recites over it: Who creates the various kinds of nourishment, and at the end, one blessing abridged from</b> the <b>three</b> blessings of Grace after Meals.",
    "<b>Rabba bar Mari said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Anything that is from the seven species</b> for which the Eretz Yisrael was praised, <b>at the start, one recites over it: Who creates fruit of the tree, and afterward and at the end, one blessing abridged from</b> the <b>three</b> blessings of Grace after Meals.",
    "<b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: What is the</b> formula of <b>one blessing abridged from</b> the <b>three</b> blessings of Grace after Meals? He said to him: <b>Over fruits of a tree one recites:</b><br><b>For the tree and the fruit of the tree,</b><br><b>and for the produce of the field,</b><br><b>and for the desirable, good and spacious land that you gave as a heritage to our ancestors</b><br><b>that they might eat of its fruit and be satisfied with its goodness.</b><br><b>Have compassion, Lord our God,</b><br><b>upon Israel Your people and upon Jerusalem Your city,</b><br><b>and upon Your Temple and upon Your altar.</b><br><b>May You rebuild Jerusalem, Your holy city, swiftly in our time,</b> <br><b>and may You bring us back there rejoicing in it</b><br><b>as You are good and do good to all.</b>",
    "After eating products baked from one of the <b>five species</b> of grain, one recites: <b>For the nourishment and sustenance and for the produce of the field, and he concludes: For the land and for the nourishment.</b>",
    "However, the question was raised: In terms of <b>conclusion, with what does he conclude</b> the blessing? As one does not conclude a blessing with two themes, with which of the themes should he conclude the blessing? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: Rav</b> would <b>conclude</b> the blessing <b>on the New Moon: Blessed…Who sanctifies Israel and the New Moons.</b> Apparently, one can conclude a blessing with two themes. <b>What</b> does one recite <b>here?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: For the land and for its fruits. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For the land and for the fruits. Rav Amram said: They do not disagree;</b> rather, <b>this</b> blessing, for its fruits, is <b>for us,</b> in Babylonia, <b>and this</b> blessing, for the fruits, is for <b>them,</b> in Eretz Yisrael.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak strongly objects: They,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>eat and we,</b> in Babylonia, <b>recite a blessing?</b> How can we, residents of Babylonia, recite a blessing for the fruits of Eretz Yisrael while eating the fruits of Babylonia? <b>Rather, reverse</b> the opinions: <b>Rav Ḥisda said: For the land and for the fruits, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For the land and for its fruits.</b>"
