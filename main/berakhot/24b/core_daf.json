    "<b>and</b> if he was stung by a louse, he may <b>feel</b> for it and remove it <b>with his garment, but he would not wrap himself</b> in his prayer shawl if it fell during prayer. <b>And when he would yawn he would place his hand on his chin</b> so that his open mouth would not be visible.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who sounds his voice during his</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer is among those of little faith,</b> as he seems to believe that the Lord cannot hear his prayer when it is uttered silently. <b>One who raises his voice during prayer is</b> considered to be <b>among the false prophets,</b> as they too were wont to cry out and shout to their gods.",
    "Furthermore, one who <b>belches and yawns</b> while praying <b>is surely among the uncouth. One who sneezes during his prayer, for him it is a bad omen. And some say: It is clear that he is repulsive.</b> Also, <b>one who spits during prayer, it is tantamount to spitting in the face of the king.</b> In light of all this, how could Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi have done all that while praying?",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>one who belches and yawns, it is not difficult: Here,</b> in the case where Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did so, <b>it was involuntary</b> and therefore permissible; <b>here,</b> where it is considered uncouth, is in a case where <b>it is deliberate.</b> However, the contradiction <b>between sneezing</b> in the case where Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did so <b>and sneezing</b> where it is considered a bad omen <b>is difficult.</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: The contradiction <b>between sneezing</b> in one case <b>and sneezing</b> in the other case <b>is also not difficult: Here,</b> in the case of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, it is referring to sneezing <b>from above,</b> his nose; <b>here,</b> where it is a bad omen, is referring to sneezing <b>from below,</b> flatulence. <b>As Rav Zeira said: In the school of Rav Hamnuna I absorbed this matter</b> in passing, <b>and it is equal</b> in significance <b>to all the rest of my learning: One who sneezes in the midst of prayer, it is a good omen for him. Just as</b> the sneeze soothes his irritation, <b>giving him pleasure below,</b> it is a sign that <b>they are similarly giving him pleasure above.</b> Since Rav Zeira sneezed often, he was extremely pleased to hear this.",
    "<b>However,</b> The contradiction <b>between spitting</b> in the case where Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did so <b>and spitting</b> where it is deemed tantamount to spitting in the face of the king <b>is difficult.</b> The Gemara replies: The contradiction <b>between spitting</b> in one case <b>and spitting</b> in the other case <b>is also not difficult,</b> as <b>it is possible</b> to resolve it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> as <b>Rav Yehuda said: One who was standing in prayer, and saliva happened</b> to accumulate in <b>his</b> mouth, <b>he absorbs it in his garment. And if it was a fine garment</b> and he does not want it to become sullied, <b>he may cover it up in his head covering.</b> That way, one is permitted to spit. The Gemara relates: <b>Ravina was standing behind Rav Ashi</b> during prayer when <b>saliva happened</b> to accumulate in <b>his</b> mouth, <b>so he discharged it behind him.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> And <b>does the Master not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that</b> statement of <b>Rav Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>one absorbs it in his head covering? He said to him: I am delicate,</b> and the mere knowledge that there is spittle in my head covering disturbs my prayer.",
    "It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who sounds his voice during his</b> <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer is among those of little faith. Rav Huna said: This was only taught</b> in a case <b>where one is able to focus his heart</b> while praying silently, <b>but</b> if he <b>is unable to focus his heart</b> while praying <b>silently, he is permitted</b> to sound his voice. <b>This applies only to</b> one praying <b>alone,</b> but when he is praying <b>in a congregation</b> his voice <b>will come to disturb the congregation</b> and it is prohibited.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Abba was avoiding</b> being seen <b>by</b> his teacher <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> as Rabbi Abba <b>sought to ascend to Eretz Yisrael</b> and his teacher disapproved, <b>as Rav Yehuda said: Anyone who ascends from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael transgresses a positive commandment, as it is stated: “They shall be taken to Babylonia and there they shall remain until the day that I recall them, said the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 27:22). Rabbi Abba did not want to discuss his desire to emigrate with Rav Yehuda. Nevertheless <b>he said: I will go and hear something from him at the hall</b> where the Sages <b>assemble,</b> without being seen, <b>and afterwards I will leave</b> Babylonia.",
    "<b>He went and found the <i>tanna</i>,</b> who recites the tannaitic sources before the study hall, <b>reciting</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Yehuda: One who was standing in prayer and sneezed</b> from below <b>waits until the odor dissipates and resumes praying. Some say: One who was standing in prayer when he felt the need to sneeze</b> from below, <b>retreats four cubits, sneezes, waits until the odor dissipates and resumes praying. And</b> before resuming his prayer, <b>he says: Master of the universe, You have formed us with many orifices and cavities; our disgrace and shame in life are clear and evident before You, as is our destiny with maggots and worms,</b> and so we should not be judged harshly. <b>And he resumes</b> his prayer <b>from where he stopped.</b>",
    "Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Had I only come</b> to the assembly of the Sages <b>to hear this teaching, it would have been sufficient for me.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught:</b> One who <b>was sleeping</b> unclothed, but was covered <b>with his garment, and he is unable to stick his head out</b> from under the garment <b>because of the cold,</b> may <b>form a barrier with his garment at his neck and recite <i>Shema</i></b> in bed. <b>And some say:</b> He must form a barrier with his garment <b>at his heart.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> shouldn’t he be prohibited from reciting <i>Shema</i> because <b>his heart sees</b> his <b>nakedness,</b> as there is no barrier between them? The Gemara responds: Indeed, the first <i>tanna</i> <b>holds that</b> when <b>one’s heart sees</b> his <b>nakedness, it is permitted</b> to recite <i>Shema</i>, and a barrier is only necessary to separate between his mouth and his nakedness.",
    "<b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who was walking in alleyways filthy</b> with human excrement and he must recite <i>Shema</i>, <b>he places his hand over his mouth and recites <i>Shema</i>. Rav Ḥisda said to him: By God!</b> Even <b>if Rabbi Yoḥanan had said it to me</b> directly, <b>with his own mouth, I would not have obeyed him.</b>",
    "<b>Some say</b> this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: One who was walking in alleyways filthy</b> with human excrement and he must recite <i>Shema</i>, <b>he places his hand over his mouth and recites <i>Shema</i>. Rav Ḥisda said to him: By God!</b> Even <b>if Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi had said it to me</b> directly, <b>with his own mouth, I would not have obeyed him.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges this: <b>Did Rav Huna</b> really <b>say that? Didn’t Rav Huna say: A Torah scholar is prohibited from standing in a place of filth, as he is unable to stand without contemplating Torah,</b> and uttering <i>Shema</i> orally is graver than mere contemplation. The Gemara responds: This <b>is not difficult; here,</b> Rav Huna prohibited contemplating Torah <b>in</b> a case where one is <b>standing</b> in a place of filth, while <b>here</b> he permitted to recite <i>Shema</i> <b>in</b> a case where one is <b>walking</b> through a place of filth.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> really <b>say that? Didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One is permitted to contemplate matters of Torah everywhere, except the bathhouse and the bathroom?</b> Consequently, it is prohibited to even contemplate Torah in a place of filth. <b>And if you say: Here, too,</b> there is a distinction between the two cases, <b>here,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan prohibited contemplating Torah <b>in</b> a case where one is <b>standing; here,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan permitted to recite <i>Shema</i> <b>in</b> a case where one is <b>walking, is that so? Wasn’t Rabbi Abbahu walking after Rabbi Yoḥanan and reciting <i>Shema</i>,</b> and <b>when he reached a filthy alleyway he fell silent</b> and stopped reciting <i>Shema</i>. When they emerged, Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: To where</b> in <i>Shema</i> <b>should I return</b> and resume reciting it? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: If you delayed</b> continuing <i>Shema</i> for an interval <b>sufficient to complete the entire</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>return to the beginning</b> and recite it from there. From the fact that Rabbi Yoḥanan did not admonish him for interrupting his recitation, apparently he, too, prohibits reciting <i>Shema</i> while walking through a filthy alleyway.",
    "The Gemara responds: This is not a proof, as <b>he says to him as follows: I do not hold</b> that one must interrupt the recitation of <i>Shema</i> in this case, but <b>for you, who holds</b> that one must, <b>if you delayed</b> <i>Shema</i> for an interval <b>sufficient to complete the entire</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>return to the beginning</b> and recite it from there.",
    "The Gemara cites tannaitic sources to corroborate both the lenient and the stringent opinions. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna, </b>and<b> it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna: One who was walking in filthy alleyways places his hand over his mouth and recites <i>Shema</i>. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda: One who was walking in filthy alleyways may not recite <i>Shema</i>. Furthermore, if he was in the course of reciting</b> <i>Shema</i> when he reached a filthy alleyway, <b>he stops</b> his recitation at that point. ",
    "The Gemara asks: If <b>one did not stop, what</b> is his status? <b>Rabbi Meyasha, son of the son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, said: Of him the verse says: “Moreover, I gave them statutes that were not good and laws by which they could not live”</b> (Ezekiel 20:25), as in this case following these statutes and laws led to sin, not to mitzva.",
    "<b>Rav Asi said</b> that this is derived from the verse: <b>“Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of vanity”</b> (Isaiah 5:18), meaning that this man brings sin upon himself for naught. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> it is derived <b>from here: “For he has shown contempt for the word of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 15:31), meaning that uttering God’s word in a place of filth shows contempt for the Lord.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And if he stopped</b> his recitation, <b>what is his reward? Rabbi Abbahu said: Of him the verse says: “And it is through this matter that you will prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:47), meaning that by being careful with one’s speech one merits longevity.",
    "<b>Rav Huna said: One</b> whose <b>garment was tied around his waist,</b> even if he was bare above the waist, <b>is permitted to recite <i>Shema</i>.</b> Indeed, <b>that</b> opinion <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> whose <b>garment</b> made <b>of cloth, of leather, of sack</b> or of any other material <b>was strapped around his waist, he is permitted to recite <i>Shema</i>.</b>"
