    "<b>Benayahu ben Yehoyada</b> corresponds to <b>the Sanhedrin,</b> since he was the head of the Sanhedrin, and <b>Evyatar</b> corresponds to <b>the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>,</b> as Evyatar ben Ahimelekh the priest would oversee inquiries directed to the <i>Urim VeTummim</i> (see I Samuel 23:9).",
    "<b>And so it says</b> regarding Benayahu ben Yehoyada’s position as head of the Sanhedrin: <b>“And Benayahu ben Yehoyada was over the <i>Kereti</i> and over the <i>Peleti</i>”</b> (II Samuel 20:23). <b>And why was</b> the Sanhedrin <b>called <i>Kereti UPeleti</i>?</b> It was called <b><i>Kereti</i></b> because <b>they were decisive [<i>koretim</i>] in their pronouncements.</b> It was called <b><i>Peleti</i></b> because <b>their pronouncements</b> and wisdom <b>were wondrous [<i>mufla’im</i>]</b>. The head of the <i>Kereti UPeleti</i> was the head of the Sanhedrin. According to the order of the verse, upon being instructed by King David to go to war, the Sages first consulted with Ahitophel, then with the Sanhedrin, then they would ask the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, <b>and</b> only <b>thereafter</b> was <b>the general of the king’s army, Yoav,</b> given the command to ready the military for battle.",
    "<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Adda, and some say Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> From <b>what verse</b> is it derived that David’s lyre would wake him at midnight? <b>“Awake, my glory; awake, harp and lyre; I will wake the dawn”</b> (Psalms 57:9). This means that the playing lyre has already woken, and now I must engage in Torah study until dawn.",
    "<b>Rabbi Zeira</b> offered a different solution to the question of whether Moses and David knew exactly when it was midnight and <b>said:</b> Moses <b>certainly knew</b> when it was midnight, <b>and David also knew.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If David knew,</b> then <b>why did he need the lyre?</b> The Gemara answers: He needed the lyre <b>to wake him from his sleep.</b>",
    "Similarly with regard to Moses, <b>since Moses knew</b> the precise moment of midnight, <b>why did he say: About midnight,</b> instead of: At midnight? Moses did so because he <b>maintained: Lest Pharaoh’s astrologers err</b> and believe midnight to be earlier. Since no disaster would have occurred, <b>they would say: Moses is a liar.</b> Moses spoke in accordance with the principle <b>articulated by the Master: Accustom your tongue to say: I do not know, lest you become entangled in</b> a web of <b>deceit.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This question is unfounded, as Moses <b>was standing at midnight of the thirteenth, leading into the fourteenth,</b> when he pronounced his prophecy, <b>and Moses told Israel</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said</b> that <b>tomorrow,</b> at the exact time <b>like midnight tonight, I will go out into the midst of Egypt.</b> This indicates that the passage should not be understood to mean about midnight, an approximation; but rather, like midnight, as a comparison, likening midnight tomorrow to midnight tonight.",
    "The Gemara further explores King David’s character. It is said: “A prayer <b>of David…Keep my soul, for I am pious”</b> (Psalms 86:1–2). Levi and Rabbi Yitzḥak debated the meaning of this verse and how David’s piety is manifest in the fact that he went beyond his fundamental obligations. <b>One said:</b> David’s declaration of piety referred to his awakening during the night to pray, and <b>so said David before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, am I not pious? As all of the kings of the East and the West sleep until the third hour</b> of the day, <b>but</b> although I am a king like them, <b>“At midnight I rise to give thanks”</b> (Psalms 119:62).",
    "<b>And the other</b> Sage said: <b>David said the following before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, am I not pious? For all of the kings of the East and the West sit in groups</b> befitting <b>their honored</b> status, but I sit as a judge who issues rulings for the people. Women come with questions of ritual impurity and <b>my hands become soiled with</b> their <b>blood</b> as I labor to determine whether or not it is blood of impurity and she has menstruating woman status, <b>and</b> with <b>a fetus that miscarried</b> at a stage of development before it was clear whether or not it is considered a birth, <b>and</b> with <b>placenta,</b> which women sometimes discharge unrelated to the birth of a child (see Leviticus 15:19–30 with regard to blood, and 12:1–8 with regard to miscarriage and placenta). King David went to all this trouble <b>in order to render a woman ritually pure</b> and consequently permitted <b>to her husband.</b> If, after examination, a Sage declares the woman ritually pure, she is permitted to be with her husband, which leads to increased love and affection, and ultimately to procreation (Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto). <b>And not only</b> do I engage in activity considered to be beneath the station of a king, <b>but I consult my teacher, Mefivoshet,</b> son of King Saul’s son, Jonathan, with regard to <b>everything that I do. I say to him: Mefivoshet, my teacher, did I decide properly? Did I convict properly? Did I acquit properly? Did I rule</b> ritually <b>pure properly? Did I rule</b> ritually <b>impure properly? And I was not embarrassed.</b> Forgoing royal dignity should make me worthy to be called pious.",
    "<b>Rav Yehoshua, son of Rav Idi, said: What verse</b> alludes to this? <b>“And I speak Your testimonies before kings and I will not be ashamed”</b> (Psalms 119:46). This verse alludes both to David’s commitment to Torah, in contrast to the kings of the East and the West, as well as to the fact that he was not ashamed to discuss matters of Torah with Mefivoshet, a descendant of kings. David was not afraid to have his mistakes corrected by Mefivoshet.",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i> from a tannaitic tradition: <b>His name was not Mefivoshet, but rather Ish Boshet was his name. Why was</b> Ish Boshet <b>referred to as Mefivoshet? Because he would embarrass [<i>mevayesh</i>] David in matters of <i>halakha</i></b>. According to this approach, Mefivoshet is an abbreviation of <i>boshet panim</i>, embarrassment. <b>Because</b> David was not embarrassed to admit his errors, <b>he merited that Kilav,</b> who, according to tradition, was exceedingly wise, <b>would descend from him.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: His name was not Kilav; rather, his name was Daniel,</b> as it appears in a different list of David’s descendants. <b>Why was he called Kilav? Because he would embarrass [<i>makhlim</i>] Mefivoshet,</b> the teacher or authority figure [av] <b>in matters of <i>halakha.</i></b>",
    "<b>In his</b> book of <b>wisdom, Solomon said</b> about this wise son: <b>“My son, if your heart is wise, my heart will be glad, even mine”</b> (Proverbs 23:15), as David enjoyed witnessing his son Kilav develop into a Torah luminary to the extent that Kilav was able to respond to Mefivoshet. <b>And</b> Solomon <b>says</b> about Kilav: <b>“Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may respond to those who taunt me”</b> (Proverbs 27:11).",
    "With regard to David’s statement, “Keep my soul, for I am pious,” the Gemara asks: <b>Did David call himself pious? Isn’t it written: “If I had not [<i>luleh</i></b>] <b>believed to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living”</b> (Psalms 27:13). The dots that appear over the word <i>luleh</i> in the text indicate doubt and uncertainty of his piety, and whether he was deserving of a place in the land of the living (see <i>Avot DeRabbi Natan</i> 34). <b>In the name of Rabbi Yosei, it was taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Why</b> do <b>dots</b> appear <b>over the word <i>luleh</i>,</b> as if there are some reservations? Because <b>David said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe. I</b> have every <b>confidence in You that You grant an excellent reward to the righteous in the World-to-Come</b> since God’s ultimate goodness is manifest in the land of eternal life, <b>but</b> I still harbor uncertainty with regard to myself, and <b>I do not know whether or not I</b> definitely <b>have a portion among them.</b> In any case, apparently David was uncertain whether or not he deserved to receive a portion of God’s reward for the righteous; how, then, could he characterize himself as pious?",
    "The Gemara responds: His concern does not prove anything, as King David knew that he was pious. He was simply concerned <b>lest a transgression</b> that he might commit in the future <b>will cause</b> him to lose his opportunity to look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.",
    "The Gemara cites a proof that there is room for one to fear lest he commit a transgression in the future <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi, as Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi raised a contradiction</b> between two verses. <b>It is written</b> that God told Jacob in his vision of the ladder: <b>“Behold, I am with you and I guard you wherever you go”</b> (Genesis 28:15), yet when Jacob returned to Canaan and realized that Esau was coming to greet him, <b>it is written: “And Jacob became very afraid,</b> and he was pained” (Genesis 32:8). Why did Jacob not rely on God’s promise? Jacob had concerns and <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Lest a transgression</b> that I might have committed after God made His promise to me <b>will cause</b> God to revoke His promise of protection.",
    "Apparently, at times, transgression does cause God’s promise to go unfulfilled, <b>as it was taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the ostensibly redundant language in a verse in the Song of the Sea: <b>“Until Your people will cross, Lord, until the people You have acquired will cross.</b> You bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance, the place, Lord, which You made for Your dwelling” (Exodus 15:16–17).",
    "The Gemara interprets homiletically that <b>until Your people will cross</b> refers to the <b>first entry</b> into Eretz Yisrael during the time of Joshua, while <b>until the people You have acquired pass over</b> refers to the <b>second entry</b> following the exile in Babylonia. <b>Based on</b> the juxtaposition of these two entries in this single verse, <b>the Sages said: Israel was worthy of having a miracle performed on its</b> behalf <b>in the time of Ezra</b> the scribe, just <b>as</b> one <b>was performed on their</b> behalf <b>in the time of Joshua bin Nun. However, transgression caused</b> the absence of a miracle.",
    "The Gemara returns to explain what we learned in the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <b>until midnight.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do they hold</b> in explaining the verse: “When you lie down”? <b>If</b> they explain this verse <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says that “when you lie down” is the time when people customarily go to sleep, then <b>let</b> the Rabbis also <b>say</b> that the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> extends, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> until the end of the first watch."
