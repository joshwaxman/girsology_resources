    "<b>tents juxtaposed to streams, as it is written: “As streams stretched forth, as gardens by the riverside; as aloes [<i>ahalim</i>] planted</b> by the Lord, as cedars by the water” (Numbers 24:6)? The Gemara vocalizes the word <i>ohalim</i>, tents, rather than <i>ahalim</i>. They are juxtaposed in order <b>to tell you: Just as streams elevate a person from ritual impurity to purity</b> after he immerses himself in their water, <b>so too tents</b> of Torah <b>elevate a person from the scale of guilt to the scale of merit.</b>",
    "We learned in our mishna: <b>One who recited</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>out of order did not fulfill</b> his obligation. One who recited and erred, should return to the place in <i>Shema</i> that he erred.",
    "With regard to an error in the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, the Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi were once tying a wedding canopy</b> in preparation <b>for</b> the wedding of <b>Rabbi Elazar. He said to them: In the meantime,</b> until you finish, <b>I will go and hear something in the study hall, and I will come and say it to you. He went and found the <i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> in the study hall, <b>who was reciting</b> this <i>Tosefta</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b>",
    "<b>One who recited</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>and erred, and does not know where</b> exactly <b>he erred;</b> if he was <b>in the middle of a paragraph</b> when he realized his error, <b>he must return to the beginning</b> of the paragraph; <b>if</b> he was <b>between one paragraph and another</b> when he realized his error but does not remember between which paragraphs, <b>he must return to the first</b> break between <b>paragraphs.</b> Similarly, <b>if one erred between writing and writing,</b> i.e., between the verse: “And you shall write them on the door posts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9) in the first paragraph and the identical verse (Deuteronomy 11:20) in the second paragraph, <b>he must return to the first writing.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: They only taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where one did not</b> yet <b>begin: “In order to lengthen your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21) which follows that verse at the end of the second paragraph. <b>However, if he</b> already <b>began</b> to recite: <b>In order to lengthen your days,</b> he can assume that <b>he assumed his routine and continued</b> and completed the second paragraph.",
    "Rabbi Elazar <b>came and told</b> Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi what he heard. <b>They said to him: Had we come only to hear this, it would have been sufficient.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The primary issue in this mishna is the requisite degree of concentration when reciting <i>Shema</i>. <b>Laborers</b> engaged in their work may <b>recite</b> <i>Shema</i> while standing <b>atop the tree or atop the course of stones</b> in a wall under construction, <b>which they are not permitted to do for</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> which requires intent of the heart.",
    "The mishna continues: <b>A groom is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i> on the first night</b> of his marriage, which was generally Wednesday night, <b>until Saturday night, if he has not taken action</b> and consummated the marriage, as he is preoccupied by concerns related to consummation of the marriage. The mishna relates that <b>there was an incident where Rabban Gamliel married a woman and recited</b> <i>Shema</i> even <b>the first night. His students said to him: Didn’t our teacher teach us that a groom is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>? He answered them:</b> Nevertheless, <b>I am not listening to you</b> to refrain from reciting <i>Shema</i>, and in so doing <b>preclude myself from</b> the acceptance of <b>the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven, for even one moment.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to laborers, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Laborers,</b> while engaged in their labor, may <b>recite</b> <i>Shema</i> while standing <b>atop the tree or atop the course of stones</b> in a wall under construction. <b>And they</b> may <b>pray atop the olive tree or the fig tree,</b> as those trees have many branches close together, so one could stand on them and focus properly while praying. In the case of <b>all the rest of the trees,</b> however, <b>they must climb down and pray.</b> However, <b>the homeowner,</b> who is self-employed, <b>in all cases,</b> regardless of the type of tree, <b>must climb down and pray, as he will be unable to focus appropriately.</b> Since, in contrast to the laborers, it is his prerogative to climb down and pray, the Sages did not permit him to pray atop the tree.",
    "<b>Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel, raised a contradiction before Rava: We learned</b> in our mishna: <b>Laborers may recite</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>atop the tree or atop the course of stones</b> in a wall under construction. <b>We see that he does not require intent,</b> simple recitation is sufficient. <b>And he raised a contradiction</b> from the verbal analogy taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who recites <i>Shema</i> must focus his heart, as it is stated: “Hear [<i>Shema</i>], Israel.” And below,</b> later in Deuteronomy, <b>it says: “Pay attention, and hear [<i>shema</i>], Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:9). <b>Just as there</b> one must <b>pay attention, so too here</b> one must <b>pay attention.</b>",
    "Rava <b>was silent</b> as he had no response. But <b>he said to him: Have you heard anything on this</b> matter? <b>He replied: Rav Sheshet said as follows: And this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that laborers may recite <i>Shema</i> atop the tree only applies <b>when they are idle from their work and recite</b> it so they can focus their hearts.",
    "The Gemara challenges this: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Beit Hillel say:</b> Laborers <b>engage in their labor and recite</b> <i>Shema</i>?",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>This is not difficult. This,</b> which says that laborers must be idle from their labor, is referring to a case when they are reciting <b>the first paragraph</b> of <i>Shema</i>, <b>while that,</b> which says that they may continue to work, is in a case when they are reciting <b>the second paragraph.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Laborers who were working for a homeowner</b> are obligated to <b>recite <i>Shema</i> and recite the blessings before it and after it; and</b> when they <b>eat their bread they</b> are obligated to <b>recite the blessing before and after it; and they</b> are obligated to <b>recite the <i>Amida</i> prayer. However, they do not descend before the ark</b> as communal prayer leaders <b>and</b> the priests among them <b>do not lift their hands</b> to recite the Priestly Blessing, so as not to be derelict in the duties they were hired to perform.",
    "The Gemara challenges this: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> that laborers recite an abridged prayer consisting of <b>a microcosm of the <i>Amida</i> prayer</b> in place of the full <i>Amida</i> prayer? <b>Rav Sheshet said: This is not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> obligating laborers to recite the full <i>Amida</i> prayer is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> as he holds that one must always recite the full eighteen blessings. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> which allows laborers to abridge their prayers is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who permits one to abridge the <i>Amida</i> prayer.",
    "The Gemara objects: But <b>if</b> this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, why</b> did the <i>baraita</i> <b>discuss</b> a case involving <b>laborers</b> in particular? Rabbi Yehoshua holds that <b>every person may also</b> recite an abridged version of the <i>Amida</i> prayer.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> we must say that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> are both in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel, and this is not difficult: Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> where laborers pray the abridged version of the <i>Amida</i> prayer, refers to a case <b>where</b> laborers <b>work for their wage</b> beyond the meal provided by their employer; <b>while here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> where laborers must pray the full <i>Amida</i> prayer, refers to a case <b>where</b> laborers <b>work</b> only <b>for their meal.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> indeed <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Laborers who were performing labor for the homeowner recite <i>Shema</i> and pray; and</b> when they <b>eat their bread they do not recite a blessing beforehand</b> because the blessing recited before food is only an obligation by rabbinic law, <b>but they recite two</b> of the three blessings normally recited in <b>the blessing thereafter,</b> the Grace after Meals, which is an obligation by Torah law. <b>How so? The first blessing</b> is recited <b>in its standard</b> formula; <b>the second blessing, he begins</b> to recite <b>the blessing of the land and they include</b> the blessing: <b>Who builds Jerusalem within the blessing of the land,</b> at which point they conclude the Grace after Meals.",
    "<b>In what</b> case <b>is this said?</b> This is said <b>with regard to</b> laborers <b>who work for their wage, but</b> if they <b>work for their meal or if the homeowner reclined</b> and ate the meal <b>with them, they recite the blessings in their standard</b> formula.",
    "We learned in the mishna that <b>a groom is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i></b> on the first night of his marriage. <b>The Sages taught</b> the source of this <i>halakha</i> in a <i>baraita</i> based on the verse: “When you sit in your home, and when you walk along the way.” <b>When you sit in your home, to the exclusion of one who is engaged in</b> performance of a <b>mitzva,</b> who is exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>; <b>and when you walk along the way, to the exclusion of a groom,</b> who is also exempt from the recitation of <i>Shema</i>. The <i>baraita</i> adds that <b>from here,</b> from this interpretation of the verses, <b>they said: One who marries a virgin is exempt</b> from the recitation of <i>Shema</i> on his wedding night, <b>but one who marries a widow is obligated.</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies the meaning of this baraita, and asks: <b>From where is it inferred</b> that the verse: “When you walk along the way,” enables us to derive that a groom is exempt from the obligation to recite Shema? <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that it is derived: <b>Like the way; just as</b> the journey along a specific <b>way</b> described in the verse <b>is voluntary</b> and involves no mitzva, <b>so too all</b> of those who are obligated to recite <i>Shema</i> are engaged in <b>voluntary activities.</b> However, one engaged in performance of a mitzva is exempt from the obligation to recite <i>Shema</i>.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Are we not dealing with</b> a case where one is walking along <b>on his way to</b> perform <b>a mitzva; nevertheless, the Torah said to recite</b> <i>Shema</i>, indicating that he is obligated even if he set out to perform a mitzva.",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> that the intention was to obligate in all cases, <b>let the Torah say: When walking</b> along the way. <b>What is</b> the meaning of: <b>When you walk</b> along the way? <b>Conclude from this: It is</b> in a case <b>of your walking,</b> meaning that when you do this for your own purposes and of your own volition, <b>you are obligated</b> to recite <i>Shema</i>, <b>but</b> when you go with the objective <b>of</b> performing a <b>mitzva, you are exempt.</b>"
