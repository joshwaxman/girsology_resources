    "<b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “But as for me, let my prayer be unto You, Lord, in a time of favor;</b> O God, in the abundance of Your mercy, answer me with the truth of Your salvation” (Psalms 69:14)? It appears that the individual is praying that his prayers will coincide with a special time of Divine favor. <b>When is a time of favor?</b> It is <b>at the time when the congregation is praying.</b> It is beneficial to pray together with the congregation, for God does not fail to respond to the entreaties of the congregation.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said that</b> the unique quality of communal prayer is derived <b>from here: “Thus said the Lord, in a time of acceptance I have answered you and on a day of salvation I have aided you”</b> (Isaiah 49:8).",
    "<b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that it is derived <b>from here: “Behold, God is mighty, He despises no one”</b> (Job 36:5). He adopts an alternative reading of the verse: “Behold, God will not despise” the prayer of “the mighty,” i.e., the community. <b>And it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me; for there were many with me.</b> God shall hear and answer them…” (Psalms 55:19–20). This verse teaches that the prayer was answered because there were many with me when it was offered.",
    "<b>That</b> last proof <b>was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where do we know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not despise the prayer of the masses? As it is stated: “Behold, God does not despise the mighty,” and it is written: “He has redeemed my soul in peace so that none came upon me;</b> for there were many with me.” Rabbi Natan interprets this not as David speaking about himself, but as God speaking to Israel. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Anyone who engages in Torah</b> study, which is called peace in the verse: “All its ways are peace” (Proverbs 3:17); <b>and in acts of kindness, and prays with the congregation, I ascribe to him</b> credit <b>as if he redeemed Me and My children from among the nations of the world.</b>",
    "Continuing to extol communal prayer, <b>Reish Lakish said: One who has a synagogue</b> nearby <b>in his city but does not enter to pray there is called an evil neighbor, as it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: As for all My evil neighbors who touch My inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit,</b> behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them” (Jeremiah 12:14). One who only touches, but does not enter the place of prayer, My inheritance, is considered an evil neighbor. <b>And furthermore,</b> he is punished in that <b>he causes himself and his children</b> to go into <b>exile, as it is stated: “Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck the house of Judah up from among them.”</b>",
    "The Gemara relates that when the Sages <b>told Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that <b>there are elders in Babylonia, he was confounded and said: It is written: “So that your days will be lengthened and the days of your children upon the land</b> the Lord swore to your forefathers to give to them like the days of heaven on the earth” (Deuteronomy 11:21); lengthened in Eretz Yisrael <b>but not outside of the Land.</b> Why then, do the residents of Babylonia live long lives? <b>When they told him</b> that the people in Babylonia <b>go early</b> in the morning <b>and go late</b> in the evening <b>to the synagogue, he said: That is what was effective for them</b> in extending their lives.",
    "<b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said to his sons: Go early and go late and enter the synagogue, so that your lives will be extended.</b> And <b>Rabbi Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> Upon <b>what verse</b> is this based? As it is stated: <b>“Happy is the man who listens to Me, watching daily at My gates, guarding at My door posts”</b> (Proverbs 8:34). <b>And</b> the reward for doing so <b>is written thereafter: “For whoso finds Me finds life and obtains the favor of the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 8:35).",
    "Based on this verse, <b>Rav Ḥisda said: A person should always enter two doorways into the synagogue.</b> This statement is unclear. Immediately, the Gemara asks: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that Rav Ḥisda meant that one should enter <b>two doorways</b> literally? What if a synagogue only has a single doorway? Rather, emend his statement and <b>say</b> that Rav Ḥisda meant that <b>one should enter a distance of two doorways</b> into the synagogue <b>and then pray.</b> In entering a distance of two doorways, one fulfills the verse: Guarding at My door posts, in the plural.",
    "Having mentioned the verse, “For whoso finds Me finds life,” the Gemara seeks to clarify its meaning. It is said, <b>“For this, let every pious man pray to You in the time of finding,</b> that the overflowing waters may not reach him” (Psalms 32:6). With regard to the phrase, the time of finding, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: The time of finding</b> refers to the time one must find <b>a wife,</b> that one should pray to find a suitable woman to marry. <b>As it is said: “He who finds [<i>matza</i>] a wife finds [<i>matza</i>] good</b> and obtains favor from the Lord” (Proverbs 18:22).",
    "<b>In Eretz Yisrael,</b> the custom was that <b>when a man married a woman, they would ask him: <i>Matza</i> or <i>motzeh</i>?</b> In other words, they would ask the groom whether the appropriate passage for his wife is the above verse from Proverbs that begins with the word <b><i>matza</i>, as it is written: “He who finds a wife finds good and obtains favor from the Lord”</b> or whether the more appropriate verse is the one beginning with the word <b><i>motzeh</i>, as it is written: “And I find [<i>motzeh</i>] the woman more bitter than death”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:26).",
    "<b>Rabbi Natan says: The time of finding</b> refers to the time of finding <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> in a verse referring to Torah: <b>“He who finds Me finds life.”</b> The Torah is the object most sought.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The time of finding</b> refers to <b>death.</b> One should pray that when death comes, he will leave the world peacefully, <b>as it is stated: “Issues [<i>totzaot</i>] of death”</b> (Psalms 68:21). Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement is based on the etymological similarity between <i>totzaot</i> and <i>matza</i>, finding.",
    "<b>It was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Nine hundred and three types of death were created in the world, as it is stated: “Issues [<i>totzaot</i>] of death,” and that,</b> 903, <b>is the numerical value [<i>gimatriya</i>] of <i>totzaot</i></b>. The Gemara explains that <b>the most difficult of</b> all these types of death <b>is croup [<i>askara</i>],</b> while <b>the easiest is</b> the <b>kiss</b> of death. <b>Croup is like a thorn</b> entangled <b>in a wool fleece, which, when pulled out backwards,</b> tears the wool. <b>Some say that</b> croup <b>is like ropes at the entrance to the esophagus,</b> which would be nearly impossible to insert and excruciating to remove. The <b>kiss</b> of death <b>is like drawing a hair from milk.</b> One should pray that he does not die a painful death.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The time of finding</b> refers to a respectful <b>burial,</b> for which one should pray. Supporting Rabbi Yoḥanan’s interpretation, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: What</b> is the <b>verse</b> that teaches that the time of finding refers to burial? <b>“Who rejoice in exultation and are glad when they can find a grave”</b> (Job 3:22), as there are situations in which one is relieved when his body finds a grave in which to rest. <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said, that is the</b> meaning of the <b>folk saying: A person should even pray for mercy until the final shovelful</b> of dirt <b>is thrown</b> upon his grave.",
    "<b>Mar Zutra said: The time of finding</b> refers to finding <b>a lavatory.</b> As most places did not have a sewage system, one was forced to relieve himself outside the city. Because of this unpleasantness, finding a suitable location was called by Mar Zutra, the time of finding. <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say: This</b> explanation <b>of Mar Zutra is preferable to all of them,</b> as the term <i>motza</i> is explicitly associated in the Bible (see II Kings 10:27) with the lavatory (Rabbi Abraham Moshe Horovitz).",
    "Returning to the tractate’s central topic, <b>Rava said to Rafram bar Pappa: Let the Master say to us some of those outstanding statements that you said in the name of Rav Ḥisda with regard to matters of the synagogue.</b>",
    "Rafram <b>said to him, Rav Ḥisda said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“The Lord loves the gates of Zion [<i>Tziyyon</i>] more than all the dwellings of Jacob”</b> (Psalms 87:2)? This means that <b>the Lord loves the gates distinguished [<i>metzuyanim</i>] through</b> the study of <i>halakha</i> as they are the gates of Zion, the outstanding gates, <b>more than the synagogues and study halls.</b> Although those places are the most outstanding of the dwellings of Jacob, they are not engaged in the study of <i>halakha</i>.",
    "<b>And this</b> concept, that <i>halakha</i> is the most sublime pursuit, is expressed in that which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: Since the day the Temple,</b> where the Divine Presence rested in this world, <b>was destroyed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, has only</b> one place <b>in His world</b> where he reveals His presence exclusively; <b>only the four cubits</b> where the study <b>of <i>halakha</i></b> is undertaken<b>.</b>",
    "This statement has practical ramifications. <b>Abaye said: At first I studied in the house and prayed in the synagogue. Once I heard what Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: Since the day the Temple was destroyed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, has only</b> one place <b>in His world, only the four cubits of <i>halakha</i> alone,</b> from which I understood the significance of the four cubits of <i>halakha</i>, and <b>I pray only where I study.</b>",
    "Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, despite</b> the fact <b>that they had thirteen synagogues in Tiberias, they would only pray between the pillars where they studied.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One who benefits from his hard labor is greater than a God-fearing</b> person, i.e., one who is so enthralled by his fear of God that he sits idly by and does not work. <b>As with regard to a God-fearing</b> person, <b>it is written: “Happy is the man who fears the Lord,</b> who greatly desires His mitzvot” (Psalms 112:1), <b>while with regard to one who benefits from his hard work, it is written: “By the labor of your hands you will live; you are happy and it is good for you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). The Gemara explains this verse to mean that <b>you are happy in this world, and it is good for you in the World-to-Come. And regarding a God-fearing</b> person, happy is the man, is written about him but <b>and it is good for you, is not written about him.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Ami said in the name of Ulla: One should always live in the place where his teacher</b> lives; thereby he will avoid sin. <b>For as long as Shimi ben Gera,</b> who according to tradition was a great Torah scholar and teacher of Solomon (see <i>Gittin</i> 59a), <b>was alive, Solomon did not marry Pharaoh’s daughter.</b> Immediately after the Bible relates the death of Shimi (I Kings, end of ch. 2), Solomon’s marriage to Pharaoh’s daughter is recorded (beginning of ch. 3).",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one <b>should not live</b> where his teacher lives?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This,</b> which says that one should live where his teacher lives, is referring to a case <b>where he is acquiescent to</b> his teacher and will heed his teaching and instruction. <b>While this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that one should not live where his teacher lives, is referring to a case <b>where he is not acquiescent to him</b> and that will lead them to quarrel.",
    "The Gemara again returns to the topic of the synagogue. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Menaḥem said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said: What is</b> the practical halakhic meaning of <b>that which is written: “They who forsake the Lord will perish”</b> (Isaiah 1:28)? <b>This</b> verse <b>refers to one who abandons the Torah</b> scroll when it was taken out to be read <b>and leaves</b> the synagogue, as it appears that he is fleeing from God.",
    "Practically speaking, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Abbahu would go out between</b> one <b>person</b> who read the Torah <b>and the</b> next <b>person</b> who did so. Since the scroll was closed between readers, it was not considered to be a show of contempt.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa raised a dilemma: What is</b> the ruling with regard to leaving <b>between</b> one <b>verse and</b> the next <b>verse?</b> Is one permitted to leave during a break in the Torah reading while the verse was translated into Aramaic?",
    "An answer to this question was not found, so the dilemma <b>stands</b> unresolved.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Sheshet would turn his face</b> away from the Torah while it was being read <b>and study.</b> Explaining this practice, <b>he said: We are</b> engaged <b>in ours,</b> the study of the Oral Torah <b>and they are</b> engaged <b>in theirs,</b> listening to the Written Torah. Since Rav Sheshet was engaged in Torah study, he is not considered one who forsakes the Lord.",
    "<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami said: A person should always complete his</b> Torah <b>portions with the congregation.</b> The congregation reads a particular Torah portion every Shabbat, and during the week prior to each Shabbat, one is required to read the <b>Bible</b> text of the weekly portion <b>twice and</b> the <b>translation once.</b>"
