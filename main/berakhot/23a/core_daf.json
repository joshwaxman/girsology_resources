    "One <b>Sage held</b> that, as a rule, <b>if</b> one interrupted his prayer and <b>delayed</b> continuing his prayer for an interval <b>sufficient to complete the entire</b> prayer, <b>he returns to the beginning</b> of the prayer. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage held:</b> He returns <b>to the place</b> in the prayer <b>where he stopped.</b>",
    "Rejecting this possibility, <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> If <b>that</b> was the crux of their dispute, they <b>should have</b> discussed the element of: <b>If he delayed</b>, and: <b>If he did not delay</b>. Nowhere in their dispute do they mention the matter of how long the delay was for. <b>Rather, everyone</b>, both Rav Ḥisda and Rav Hamnuna, <b>agrees that if one delayed</b> continuing his prayer for an interval <b>sufficient to complete the entire</b> prayer, <b>he returns to the beginning</b> of the prayer. <b>And there</b>, in the dispute under discussion, <b>they disagree with regard to one who did not delay</b> that long. The dispute centers on the status of the one praying in this particular case. <b>As</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that since he evidently needed to urinate before starting his prayer, <b>he is a man who was disqualified, and unfit</b> for prayer, <b>and his prayer is not</b> a valid <b>prayer</b>; therefore he must repeat it in its entirety. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage holds he is a man who was fit</b> for prayer <b>and his prayer is</b> a valid <b>prayer</b>.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who needs to relieve himself may not pray, and if he prayed, his prayer is an abomination. Rav Zevid and some say Rav Yehuda said</b> in qualifying this statement: <b>They only taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a case where <b>one cannot restrain himself. But, if he can restrain himself, his prayer is a</b> valid <b>prayer</b> as he is not tarnished by his need to relieve himself.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>how long</b> must he be able to restrain himself? <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> For <b>as long as</b> it takes to walk <b>one parasang. Some teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> directly <b>on</b> what was taught in <b>the <i>baraita</i>: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? Where he is unable to restrain himself, but if he is able to restrain himself, his prayer is a</b> valid <b>prayer. And for how long? Rav Zevid said:</b> For <b>as long as</b> it takes to walk <b>one parasang.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: One who needs to relieve himself may not pray, because it is stated: “Prepare to greet your God, O Israel”</b> (Amos 4:12), and one must clear his mind of all distractions to prepare to receive the Lord during prayer.",
    "In this context, the Gemara cites an additional statement, which <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What is</b> the meaning of <b>that which is written: “Guard your foot when you go to the house of God,</b> and prepare to listen; it is better than when fools offer sacrifices, as they know not to do evil” (Ecclesiastes 4:17)? It means: When you enter the house of the Lord, <b>guard yourself from transgression, and if you commit a transgression, bring a sacrifice before Me</b> in atonement. The verse continues: <b>“And draw near and listen to the words of the wise.” Rava said: Be prepared to hearken to the words of the wise, who, if they commit a transgression, they bring a sacrifice and repent.</b> He interprets the next part of the verse: <b>“It is better than when fools give sacrifices,”</b> that <b>one should not act like the fools who commit a transgression and bring a sacrifice but do not repent.</b>",
    "Regarding the end of the verse: <b>“As they know not to do evil,”</b> the Gemara asks: <b>If so, they are righteous. Rather</b> it must be understood: <b>Do not be like the fools who commit a transgression and bring a sacrifice, but are unaware whether they are bringing it</b> as a thanks-offering <b>for the good,</b> or as an offering of atonement <b>for the evil.</b> This is the meaning of the verse: “As they know not to do evil”; they know not if and when their actions are evil. With regard to those individuals, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: They cannot distinguish between good and evil and</b> yet <b>they bring a sacrifice before me?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ashi and some say Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa said: Mind your orifices when you stand before me in prayer.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught: One who enters a bathroom must remove his phylacteries at a distance of four cubits and enter. Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: This was only taught</b> with regard to one entering <b>a regular bathroom, but</b> one who enters <b>a makeshift bathroom may remove</b> his phylacteries and <b>defecate immediately. But when one exits</b> from a makeshift bathroom, <b>he must distance himself four cubits</b> before <b>donning</b> his phylacteries because <b>he has</b> now <b>rendered</b> that place <b>a regular bathroom.</b>",
    "<b>A dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages in the yeshiva: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; may <b>one enter a regular bathroom wearing his phylacteries in order to urinate?</b> The Sages disagreed: <b>Ravina permitted</b> to do so while <b>Rav Adda bar Mattana prohibited</b> it. <b>They came</b> and <b>asked this of Rava. He said to them: It is forbidden</b> because <b>we are concerned lest he will</b> come to <b>defecate with them</b> still on. <b>Others say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is because we are concerned that, since he is already in the bathroom, he <b>might</b> forget that his phylacteries are on his head and <b>will break wind with them</b> still on him.",
    "<b>It was taught in another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who enters a regular bathroom must remove his phylacteries at a distance of four cubits, place them in the window</b> in the wall of the bathroom <b>adjacent to the public domain, and then enter. And when he exits, he must distance</b> himself <b>four cubits before donning them.</b> This is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel say:</b> He must remove his phylacteries but <b>he holds them in his hand and enters. Rabbi Akiva says: He holds them in his garment and enters.</b>",
    "The Gemara wonders: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> to say <b>in his garment?</b> There is room for concern because <b>sometimes he forgets them and</b> they <b>fall. Rather, say: He holds them with his garment and in his hand and enters</b> the bathroom. He holds the phylacteries in his hand and covers it with the garment.",
    "It was established in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> if there is room to place them, <b>he places them in the holes adjacent to the bathroom, but he does not place them in the holes adjacent to the public domain, lest</b> the phylacteries <b>will be taken by passersby and he will come to be suspect.</b>",
    "<b>And an incident</b> occurred <b>involving a student who placed his phylacteries in the holes adjacent to the public domain, and a prostitute passed by and took</b> the phylacteries. <b>She came to the study hall and said: See what so-and-so gave me as my payment. When that student heard this, he ascended to the rooftop and fell and died. At that moment they instituted that one should hold them with his garment and in his hand and enter</b> to avoid situations of that kind.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> on this topic: <b>At first, they would place the phylacteries in the holes adjacent to the bathroom, and mice would come and take them</b> or gnaw upon them. Therefore, <b>they instituted that they should place them in the holes adjacent to the public domain,</b> where there were no mice. However, <b>passersby would come and take the</b> phylacteries. Ultimately, <b>they instituted that one should hold</b> the phylacteries <b>in his hand and enter.</b>",
    "On this topic, <b>Rabbi Meyasha, son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, said: The <i>halakha</i></b> in this case <b>is that one rolls up</b> the phylacteries in their straps <b>like a scroll, and holds them in his hand opposite his heart. Rav Yosef bar Manyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> This is <b>provided that the strap</b> of the phylacteries <b>does not emerge</b> more than <b>a handbreadth below his hand.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira said: It was only taught</b> that one rolls up his phylacteries when there is still <b>time</b> left <b>in the day to don them. If there is not time</b> left <b>in the day to don them</b> before nightfall, when phylacteries are not donned, <b>he makes a one-handbreadth pouch of sorts for them and he places them</b> in it.",
    "Similarly, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: During the day one rolls up</b> the phylacteries <b>like a scroll and places them in his hand opposite his heart, and at night he makes a one-handbreadth pouch of sorts for them and he places them</b> in it.",
    "<b>Abaye said: They only taught</b> that it must be a one-handbreadth pouch <b>with regard to a vessel that is</b> the phylacteries’ regular <b>vessel, but in a vessel that is not their</b> regular <b>vessel,</b> he may place the phylacteries in it, <b>even</b> if it is <b>less than a handbreadth.</b>",
    "<b>Mar Zutra and, some say, Rav Ashi, said</b> as proof for that distinction: The laws of impurity state that only a space of at least a handbreadth can serve as a barrier to prevent the spread of impurity imparted by a corpse. Nevertheless, <b>small</b> sealed <b>vessels</b> less than a handbreadth in size <b>protect</b> their contents from ritual impurity even if they are inside <b>a tent over a corpse.</b> This proves that even a space smaller than a handbreadth can serve as a barrier before impurity.",
    "<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: When we would walk after Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> we would see <b>that when he sought to enter the bathroom while holding a book of <i>aggada</i>, he would give</b> it <b>to us. When he was holding phylacteries, he would not give</b> them <b>to us,</b> as <b>he said: Since the Sages permitted</b> to hold <b>them,</b>"
