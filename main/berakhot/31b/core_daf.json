    "<b>an unseemly matter, he must reprimand him,</b> is derived. <b>“And Hannah answered and she said no, my master,</b> I am a woman of sorrowful spirit, and I have drunk neither wine nor liquor, but I pour out my soul before the Lord” (I Samuel 1:15). Regarding the words: “No, my master,” <b>Ulla, and some say Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that <b>she said to him,</b> in an allusion: <b>With regard to this matter, you are not a master, and the Divine Spirit does not rest upon you, as you</b> falsely <b>suspect me of this.</b>",
    "<b>Some say</b> another version of her response. <b>She said to him,</b> questioning: <b>Aren’t you a master? Aren’t the Divine Presence and Divine Spirit with you that you judged me to be guilty, and you did not judge me to be innocent? Didn’t you know that I am a woman of distressed spirit?</b>",
    "With regard to Hannah’s explanation that <b>“I have drunk neither wine nor liquor,” Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>that one who is suspected of something of which he is not</b> guilty cannot suffice merely with the personal knowledge of his innocence, but <b>must inform</b> the one who suspects him that he is innocent and clear himself of suspicion.",
    "<b>“Do not take your maidservant as a wicked woman [<i>bat beliya’al</i>]</b> for out of the abundance of my complaint and anger have I spoken until now” (I Samuel 1:16). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that when a drunk person prays it is as if he engaged in idol worship</b> is derived as <b>it is written here</b> that Hannah, suspected of praying while drunk, defends herself and says: “Do not take your maidservant <b>as a <i>bat beliya’al</i>”;</b> and <b>it is written there,</b> with regard to a city that has been instigated to engage in idol worship: <b>“<i>Benei beliya’al</i> have gone out from your midst</b> and have lured the inhabitants of their city, saying let us go and serve other gods which we have not known” (Deuteronomy 13:14). By means of this verbal analogy it is derived: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of the idolatrous city, the term <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship, so too here,</b> in the case of one who prays drunk, <i>beliya’al</i> indicates <b>idol worship.</b>",
    "The verse continues: <b>“And Eli answered and said: May you go in peace”</b> (I Samuel 1:17). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>that one who suspects another of something that he has not</b> done, <b>he must appease him. Moreover,</b> the one who suspected him <b>must bless him,</b> as Eli continued and offered Hannah a blessing, <b>as it is stated: “And may the God of Israel grant your request</b> that you have asked of Him” (I Samuel 1:17).",
    "Incidental to this discussion of Hannah’s prayer, the Gemara explores related topics. In her prayer, Hannah said: <b>“And she swore an oath and said, Lord of Hosts [<i>Tzeva’ot</i>]</b> if You will indeed look upon the affliction of Your maidservant and remember me, and not forget Your maidservant and will give Your maidservant a male child, I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and there shall be no razor come upon his head” (I Samuel 1:11). <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From the day that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created His world, there was no person who called the Holy One, Blessed be He, Lord of Hosts until Hannah came and called Him Lord of Hosts.</b> This is the first time in the Bible that God is referred to by this name.",
    "Rabbi Elazar explains that <b>Hannah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> are You not the Lord of the Hosts, and <b>of all of the hosts and hosts</b> of creations <b>that You created in Your world, is it difficult in Your eyes to grant me one son?</b>",
    "The Gemara suggests <b>a parable: To what is this similar?</b> It is similar to <b>a flesh and blood king who made a feast for his servants. A poor person came and stood at the door. He said to them: Give me one slice</b> of bread! <b>And they paid him no attention. He pushed and entered before the king. He said to him: My lord, the King, from this entire feast that you have prepared, is it so difficult in your eyes to give me a single slice</b> of bread?",
    "As for the double language in the verse, <b>“if you will look upon [<i>im ra’o tireh</i>],” Rabbi Elazar said: Hannah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, if You will look upon [<i>ra’o</i></b>] me now, <b>fine, and if not,</b> in any case <b>You will see</b> [<b><i>tireh</i></b>].",
    "What was Hannah threatening? She said: <b>I will go and seclude myself</b> with another man <b>before Elkana, my husband. Since I secluded myself, they will force me to drink the <i>sota</i> water</b> to determine whether or not I have committed adultery. I will be found innocent, <b>and</b> since <b>You will not make Your Torah false [<i>pelaster</i>],</b> I will bear children. With regards to a woman who is falsely suspected of adultery and drank the <i>sota</i> water, the Torah <b>says:</b> “And if the woman was not defiled, but was pure, then <b>she shall be acquitted and she shall conceive”</b> (Numbers 5:28).",
    "However, Rabbi Elazar’s opinion <b>works out well</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that the verse means: <b>If she were barren, she will be remembered</b> by God and granted children. <b>But</b> according <b>to the one who said</b> that the verse means that childbearing will be easier and more successful, i.e., <b>if she had</b> previously <b>given birth with pain,</b> she now <b>gives birth with ease,</b> or if she had previously given birth to <b>daughters,</b> she now <b>gives birth to sons,</b> or if she had previously given birth to <b>black</b> children, considered to be unattractive, she now <b>gives birth to fair</b> children, or if she had previously given birth to <b>short,</b> weak children, she <b>gives birth to tall,</b> strong children, <b>what can be said?</b>",
    "<b>As it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <i>tanna’im</i> disputed the interpretation of the verse in Numbers: <b>“Then she shall be acquitted and she shall conceive” teaches that if she was barren, she will be remembered</b> by God and granted children; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva said to him: If so, all barren women will go and seclude themselves</b> with men who are not their husbands, <b>and any</b> woman <b>who did not</b> commit the <b>sin</b> of adultery <b>will be remembered</b> by God and granted children. <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>teaches</b> that this is merely a promise for greater ease in childbirth; <b>if she has</b> previously <b>given birth with pain,</b> she now <b>gives birth with ease,</b> if she has previously given birth to <b>short</b> children, she <b>gives birth to tall</b> children, if she has previously given birth to <b>black</b> children, she now <b>gives birth to fair</b> children, if she has previously given birth to <b>one</b> child, she now <b>gives birth to two</b> children.",
    "According to Rabbi Akiva’s explanation, <b>what</b> is derived from the double language uttered by Hannah: <b><i>Im ra’o tireh</i>? The Torah spoke in the language of men,</b> meaning that this double language is not extraordinary and nothing may be derived from it. It is common biblical vernacular.",
    "In the oath/prayer uttered by Hannah, she refers to herself as “Your servant” [<i>amatekha</i>] three times: <b>“The affliction of Your maidservant…</b>and <b>not forget Your maidservant and will give Your maidservant”</b> (I Samuel 1:11).",
    "<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Why</b> are <b>these three maidservants [<i>amatot</i>]</b> cited in the verse? They are cited to teach that <b>Hannah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You have created three crucibles</b> potentially leading to <b>death in a woman,</b> where she is particularly vulnerable. Alternatively, <b>some say:</b> Master of the Universe, You have created <b>three accelerants of death</b> in a woman. <b>They are</b> mitzvot that, as a rule, pertain to women: Observing the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> separating <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from dough, <b>and lighting</b> Shabbat <b>candles. Have I ever violated one of them?</b> Hannah attests to her status as God’s maidservant [ama]. The reference to these three mitzvot is drawn from the etymological similarity between <i>amatekha</i>, your maidservant, and <i>mita</i>, death.",
    "Later in her prayer, Hannah says: <b>“And You will grant Your servant an offspring of men.”</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>“an offspring of men”? Rav said:</b> Hannah prayed for <b>a man among men,</b> a son who would be outstanding and exceptional. <b>And Shmuel said:</b> This expression means <b>an offspring who will anoint two men</b> to royalty. <b>And who were they? Saul and David. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Hannah prayed that she would bear <b>an offspring who</b> would be <b>the equivalent of two</b> of the world’s greatest <b>men. And who were they? Moses and Aaron. As it is stated: “Moses and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who call His name”</b> (Psalms 99:6). In this verse, Hannah’s son, Samuel, is equated to Moses and Aaron. <b>And the Rabbis say: “An offspring of men”:</b> Hannah prayed for <b>an offspring who would be inconspicuous among men,</b> that he would not stand out in any way.",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> in explanation: Hannah prayed that her son would not be conspicuous among men; <b>neither too tall nor too short; neither too small nor too fat; neither too white nor too red; neither too smart nor too stupid.</b>",
    "When Hannah came to the Temple with her son Samuel, she told Eli: “My lord, as your soul lives, my lord, <b>I am the woman who stood here with you</b> to pray to the Lord” (I Samuel 1:26). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that it is forbidden to sit within four cubits of</b> one who is <b>praying</b> is derived. As the verse says: “Who stood here with you,” indicating that Eli stood alongside Hannah because she was praying.",
    "Additionally, Hannah’s emphasis in speaking to Eli, <b>“for this youth I prayed”</b> (I Samuel 1:27), indicates that she came to protect him from danger. As <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Samuel was</b> one who <b>taught <i>halakha</i> in the presence of his teacher.</b> Hannah wanted to pray that he not be punished by death at the hand of Heaven for his transgression, <b>as it is stated: “And they slaughtered the cow and they brought the youth to Eli”</b> (I Samuel 1:25). This verse is puzzling. <b>Because they slaughtered the cow,</b> therefore, <b>they brought the youth to Eli?</b> What does one have to do with the next?",
    "<b>Rather,</b> this is what happened: <b>Eli said to</b> those who brought the offering: <b>Call a priest; he will come and slaughter</b> the offering. <b>Samuel saw them looking for a priest to slaughter</b> the animal. <b>He said to them: Why do you</b> need <b>to look for a priest to slaughter</b> it? <b>Slaughter</b> of an offering performed <b>by a non-priest is valid. They brought him before Eli</b> to clarify his statement. Eli <b>said to him: How do you know this?</b> Samuel <b>said to him: Is it written</b> in the Torah: <b>And the priest shall slaughter</b> indicating that the offering may only be slaughtered by a priest? <b>It is written: “And the priests shall offer,”</b> only <b>from</b> the stage of <b>receiving</b> the blood in the bowls <b>and onward is it a mitzva</b> incumbent upon <b>priests</b> alone. <b>From here</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>slaughter by a non-priest is acceptable</b> is derived.",
    "Eli <b>said to</b> Samuel: <b>You have spoken well</b> and your statement is correct, but <b>nevertheless, you are</b> one who <b>issued a halakhic ruling in the presence of your teacher, and anyone who issues a halakhic ruling in the presence of his teacher,</b> even if the particular <i>halakha</i> is correct, <b>is liable for death</b> at the hand of Heaven for showing contempt for his teacher. <b>Hannah came and shouted before him: “I am the woman who stood here with you</b> to pray to the Lord;” do not punish the child who was born of my prayers. <b>He said to her: Let me punish him, and I will pray</b> for mercy, that the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>will grant you</b> a son who will be <b>greater than</b> this one. <b>She said to him: “For this youth I prayed”</b> and I want no other.",
    "The Gemara continues to deal with Hannah’s prayer. It is said: <b>“And Hannah spoke on her heart.”</b> Several interpretations are offered to explain her use of the phrase “on her heart” instead of the common phrase to her heart (Maharsha). <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra:</b> Hannah spoke to God <b>concerning matters of her heart. She said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> of <b>all</b> the organs <b>You created in a woman, You have not created one in vain.</b> Every organ fulfills its purpose; <b>eyes to see, ears to hear, a nose to smell, a mouth to speak, hands with which to perform labor, feet with which to walk, breasts with which to nurse.</b> If so, <b>these breasts that You placed upon my heart, to what</b> purpose did You place them? Was it <b>not</b> in order <b>to nurse with them? Grant me a son and I will nurse with them.</b>",
    "Tangentially, the Gemara also cites an additional statement that <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Zimra: Anyone who sits</b> in observance of a <b>fast on Shabbat,</b> his merit is great and <b>they tear up</b> and repeal <b>his sentence of seventy years;</b> because everyone is enjoying himself and a feast is prepared, it is more difficult to fast on Shabbat than on any other day. <b>Nevertheless, they then hold him accountable</b> for failing to fulfill <b>the <i>halakha</i> of delight of Shabbat</b>.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is his remedy</b> to atone and avoid punishment? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: He must sit</b> in observance of another <b>fast</b> on a weekday to atone <b>for the fast</b> on Shabbat.",
    "After explaining the uncommon expression, on her heart, the Gemara cites an additional statement in the matter of Hannah. <b>And Rabbi Elazar said: Hannah spoke impertinently toward</b> God <b>on High. As it is stated: “And she prayed onto the Lord,”</b> as opposed to the common phrase: To the Lord. This <b>teaches that she spoke impertinently toward on High.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> on a similar note, <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Elijah spoke impertinently toward</b> God <b>on High</b> as well in his prayer at Mount Carmel, <b>as it is stated:</b> “Answer me, Lord, answer me, that this people will know that You are the Lord, God, <b>and You have turned their hearts backward”</b> (I Kings 18:37), claiming that God caused Israel to sin. On this topic, <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rabbi Yitzḥak said: From where do we know that the Holy One, Blessed be He, ultimately conceded to Elijah</b> that he was correct?"
