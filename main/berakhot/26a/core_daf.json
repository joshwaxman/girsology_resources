    "<b>atop a chest is like a vessel within a vessel.</b> On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> One who wishes to engage in marital relations in a room in which there is <b>a Torah scroll, must erect a partition ten</b> handbreadths high. The Gemara relates: <b>Mar Zutra happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Ashi</b> and <b>he saw</b> that <b>in the</b> bed <b>chamber of</b> his son <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi, there was a Torah scroll, and a partition of ten</b> handbreadths <b>had been erected for it. He said to him: In accordance with whose</b> opinion did you do this? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi? Say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> this only as a makeshift solution in exigent situations, when <b>he has no other room</b> in which to place it, but <b>don’t</b> you, <b>Master, have another room</b> where you could place the Torah scroll? <b>He said to him:</b> Indeed, <b>that</b> did <b>not</b> enter <b>my mind.</b>",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>And, how far must one distance himself from urine and from feces</b> in order to recite <i>Shema</i>? <b>Four cubits. Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Seḥora said</b> that <b>Rav Huna said: They only taught</b> that it is sufficient to distance oneself four cubits when the feces are <b>behind him, but</b> if they are <b>before him he must distance himself</b> to the point that it is <b>no longer within his range of vision;</b> and the <i>halakha</i> <b>is the same</b> for <b>prayer.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges this: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rafram bar Pappa say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said: One may stand opposite a bathroom and pray.</b> The Gemara resolves this contradiction: <b>With what are we dealing here? With a bathroom that has no feces,</b> and therefore there is no need to distance himself to that extent.",
    "The Gemara asks again: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav Yosef bar Ḥanina say: The bathroom to which</b> the Sages <b>referred</b> in all of the <i>halakhot</i> of distancing oneself was <b>even</b> one <b>in which there were no feces, and the bathhouse to which</b> the Sages <b>referred</b> in all of the <i>halakhot</i> of uttering sacred matters, was <b>even</b> one <b>in which there was no</b> naked <b>person. Rather, with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a new</b> structure, built as a bathroom but not yet used for that purpose.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t this</b> already <b>raised as a dilemma</b> by <b>Ravina: One who designated</b> the structure for use <b>as a bathroom, what is its</b> legal status? Is <b>designation</b> effective <b>or is designation not</b> effective? The Gemara replies: <b>When Ravina raised the dilemma,</b> it was whether or not one may <b>stand and pray inside it, but</b> he had <b>no</b> dilemma whether or <b>not one may pray opposite it.</b>",
    "<b>Rava said: These Persian bathrooms, even though they contain feces, they are considered as sealed,</b> as they are constructed on an incline so the feces will roll out of the bathroom underground.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Continuing the earlier discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of immersion for Torah study and prayer for one who experienced a seminal emission, the mishna discusses a case where individuals who were already impure with a severe form of ritual impurity are exposed to the impurity of a seminal emission as well. They are required to immerse themselves and purify themselves of the impurity of the seminal emission even though they remain impure due to the more severe impurity. Consequently, even a <b><i>zav</i>,</b> whose impurity lasts at least seven days, <b>who experienced a seminal emission,</b> for which, were he not a <i>zav</i>, he would be impure for only one day; <b>a menstruating woman who discharged semen,</b> despite the fact that she is already impure with a severe impurity unaffected by her immersion; <b>and</b> a woman <b>who engaged in conjugal relations</b> with her husband <b>and</b> later <b>saw menstrual blood,</b> all <b>require immersion. And Rabbi Yehuda exempts</b> them from immersion.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the students of the yeshiva: <b>One who experienced a seminal emission</b> and was therefore required to immerse himself, who later <b>saw a discharge</b> that rendered him a <b><i>zav</i>; according to Rabbi Yehuda, what is his legal status?</b> The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>When,</b> in our mishna, <b>Rabbi Yehuda exempted a <i>zav</i> who saw a seminal emission</b> from immersion, that <b>was because from the outset he was not fit for immersion,</b> as the immersion would not be effective in purifying him from the impurity of a <i>zav</i>; <b>however, one who experienced a seminal emission,</b> who later <b>saw a discharge</b> that rendered him a <b><i>zav</i>,</b> who <b>was fit for immersion</b> and only later became impure with the severe impurity of a <i>zav</i>, would Rabbi Yehuda <b>require</b> immersion? <b>Or perhaps there is no difference</b> and he is exempt from immersion in both cases?",
    "In order to resolve this dilemma, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> the last case of the mishna: A woman <b>who engaged in conjugal relations</b> with her husband <b>and</b> later <b>saw menstrual blood requires immersion. And Rabbi Yehuda exempts</b> them from immersion. <b>Isn’t the</b> woman <b>who engaged in conjugal relations</b> with her husband <b>and</b> later <b>saw menstrual blood like one who experienced a seminal emission,</b> who later <b>saw a discharge</b> that rendered him a <b><i>zav</i>,</b> as in both cases there is a less severe ritual impurity followed by a more severe impurity; <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>Rabbi Yehuda exempts. Conclude from this</b> that Rabbi Yehuda does not distinguish between the cases. And indeed, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya explicitly taught: One who experienced a seminal emission</b> who later <b>saw a discharge</b> that rendered him a <b><i>zav</i> requires immersion, and Rabbi Yehuda exempts.</b>",
    "May we return to thee: He whose dead!",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna determines the times beyond which the different prayers may not be recited. According to the Rabbis, <b>the morning prayer</b> may be recited <b>until noon. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It may be recited only <b>until four hours</b> after sunrise. According to the Rabbis, <b>the afternoon prayer</b> may be recited <b>until the evening. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It may be recited only <b>until the midpoint of the afternoon [<i>pelag haminḥa</i>],</b> i.e., the midpoint of the period that begins with the sacrifice of the daily afternoon offering and ends at nightfall, which is the end of the afternoon.",
    "<b>The evening prayer</b> may be recited throughout the night and <b>is not fixed</b> to a specific hour. According to the Rabbis, <b>the additional prayer</b> may be recited <b>all day. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It may be recited only <b>until seven hours</b> after sunrise.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> We learned in the mishna that the morning prayer may be recited only until a few hours into the day. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The mitzva</b> is to recite the morning <i>Shema</i> <b>with sunrise</b> so that <b>he will juxtapose redemption,</b> which is mentioned in the blessings following <i>Shema</i>, <b>to</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> which is recited immediately after sunrise, and <b>find</b> himself <b>praying in the daytime.</b> Clearly, the time to recite the morning prayer is immediately after sunrise.",
    "The Gemara responds: This <i>baraita</i> does not establish a binding <i>halakha</i>. Rather, it <b>taught that</b> rule specifically <b>with regard to those who are scrupulous in fulfillment of mitzvot [<i>vatikin</i>]. As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <i>Vatikin</i> would finish</b> reciting the morning <i>Shema</i> <b>with sunrise,</b> but those who are not <i>vatikin</i> may recite their prayers later.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Does everyone</b> hold that one may recite the morning prayer only <b>until noon and no later? Didn’t Rav Mari, son of Rav Huna, son of Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba, say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who erred and did not recite the evening prayer, prays in the morning prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers; one who erred and did not recite <b>the morning prayer, prays in the afternoon prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers? Apparently, the morning prayer may be recited until the evening, at least in the event that he forgot to recite it in the morning.",
    "The Gemara answers: Indeed, <b>one may continue praying for the entire day.</b> However, if he prayed <b>until noon, they give him a reward for</b> reciting the <b>prayer at its</b> appointed <b>time.</b> If he prayed <b>from there on, they give him a reward for</b> reciting the <b>prayer. They do not give him a reward for</b> reciting the <b>prayer at its</b> appointed <b>time.</b>",
    "On the topic of one who forgot to pray and seeks to compensate for the prayer that he missed, <b>a dilemma was raised before them</b> in the study hall: <b>One who erred and did not recite the afternoon prayer, what is</b> the ruling? May he <b>recite</b> in <b>the evening prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers? The Gemara articulates the sides of the dilemma: <b>If you say</b> that <b>one who erred and did not pray the evening prayer prays in the morning prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers, perhaps that is <b>because</b> the evening and the morning are both part of <b>one day, as it is written: “And there was evening and there was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5); the evening and the following morning constitute a single unit. <b>But here,</b> in the case under discussion, perhaps <b>prayer is in place of sacrifice.</b> Since in the case of sacrifice we say, <b>since its day passed, its sacrifice is invalid</b> and there is no way to compensate for the missed opportunity, the same should be true for prayer. <b>Or, perhaps, since prayer is supplication, any time that one wishes, he may continue to pray?</b>",
    "<b>Come and hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from that <b>which Rav Huna bar Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who erred and did not recite the afternoon prayer, prays in the evening prayer two</b> <i>Amida</i> prayers <b>and there is no element of: Its day passed, its sacrifice is invalid.</b>",
    "With regard to the possibility to compensate for a prayer that he failed to recite at its appointed time, the Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>. The meaning of the verse: <b>“That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:15), is as follows: <b>That which is crooked cannot be made straight</b> refers to <b>one who omitted the evening <i>Shema</i> and the morning <i>Shema,</i> or the evening prayer, or the morning prayer. And that which is wanting cannot be numbered [<i>lehimanot</i>]</b> refers to <b>one whose friends reached a consensus [<i>nimnu</i>]</b> to perform <b>a mitzva and he was not part of their consensus [<i>nimnu</i>]</b> and, consequently, he missed his opportunity to join them in performance of the mitzva. This <i>baraita</i> clearly states that there is no way to compensate for a missed prayer.",
    "To resolve this difficulty, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: With what are we dealing here</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? We are dealing with a case where one <b>intentionally failed</b> to recite the prayer. Only then he has no remedy. However, one who failed to pray due to error can compensate for the missed prayer by reciting the next prayer twice.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise as it teaches omitted and did not teach erred.</b> This indicates that the <i>halakha</i> is different in the case of error. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from this.</b>"
