    "<b>and from phylacteries, but</b> they <b>are obligated in</b> the mitzvot of <b>prayer, <i>mezuza</i>, and Grace after Meals.</b> The Gemara explains the rationale for these exemptions and obligations.",
    "GEMARA With regard to the mishna’s statement that women are exempt from <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>,</b> the Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious,</b> as <i>Shema</i> is a <b>time-bound, positive mitzva, and</b> the halakhic principle is: <b>Women are exempt from any time-bound, positive mitzva,</b> i.e., any mitzva whose performance is only in effect at a particular time. <i>Shema</i> falls into that category as its recitation is restricted to the morning and the evening. Why then did the mishna need to mention it specifically?",
    "The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say: Since</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>includes</b> the acceptance of the yoke of <b>the kingdom of Heaven,</b> perhaps women are obligated in its recitation despite the fact that it is a time-bound, positive mitzva. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that, nevertheless, women are exempt.",
    "We also learned in the mishna that women are exempt <b>from phylacteries.</b> The Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious</b> as well. The donning of phylacteries is only in effect at particular times; during the day but not at night, on weekdays but not on Shabbat or Festivals. The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say: Since</b> the mitzva of phylacteries <b>is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to</b> the mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>,</b> as it is written: “And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hands and they shall be frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 6:8), followed by: “And you shall write them upon the door posts of your house and on your gates” (Deuteronomy 6:9), just as women are obligated in the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>, so too they are obligated in the mitzva of phylacteries. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that nevertheless, women are exempt.",
    "We also learned in the mishna that women, slaves, and children are <b>obligated in prayer.</b> The Gemara explains that, although the mitzva of prayer is only in effect at particular times, which would lead to the conclusion that women are exempt, nevertheless, since prayer <b>is</b> supplication for <b>mercy</b> and women also require divine mercy, they are obligated. However, <b>lest you say: Since</b> regarding prayer it is <b>written: “Evening and morning and afternoon</b> I pray and cry aloud and He hears my voice” (Psalms 55:18), perhaps prayer should be <b>considered a time-bound, positive mitzva</b> and women would be exempt, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that, fundamentally, the mitzva of prayer is not time-bound and, therefore, everyone is obligated.",
    "We also learned in the mishna that women are obligated in the mitzva of <b><i>mezuza</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: That too is <b>obvious.</b> Why would they be exempt from fulfilling this obligation, it is a positive mitzva that is not time-bound? The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say: Since</b> the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i> <b>is juxtaposed</b> in the Torah to the mitzva of <b>Torah study</b> (Deuteronomy 11:19–20), just as women are exempt from Torah study, so too they are exempt from the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>. Therefore, the mishna explicitly <b>teaches us</b> that they are obligated.",
    "We also learned in the mishna that women are obligated to recite the <b>Grace after Meals.</b> The Gemara asks: That too is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say: Since it is written: “When the Lord shall give you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to the full”</b> (Exodus 16:8), one might conclude that the Torah established fixed times for the meals and, consequently, for the mitzva of Grace after Meals and, therefore, it <b>is considered a time-bound, positive mitzva,</b> exempting women from its recitation. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that women are obligated.",
    "<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Women are obligated to</b> recite the sanctification of the Shabbat day [<b><i>kiddush</i>]by Torah law.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why?</b> <i>Kiddush</i> is a <b>time-bound, positive mitzva, and women are exempt</b> from <b>all time-bound, positive mitzvot. Abaye said:</b> Indeed, women are obligated to recite <i>kiddush</i> by <b>rabbinic,</b> but not by Torah <b>law.</b>",
    "<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: There are two refutations to your explanation. First, Rav Adda bar Ahava said that women are obligated to recite <i>kiddush</i> <b>by Torah law, and, furthermore,</b> the very explanation is difficult to understand. If the Sages do indeed institute ordinances in these circumstances, <b>let us obligate them</b> to fulfill <b>all</b> time-bound, <b>positive mitzvot by rabbinic law,</b> even though they are exempt by Torah law.",
    "<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> This has a unique explanation. In the Ten Commandments in the book of Exodus, <b>the verse said: “Remember</b> Shabbat and sanctify it” (Exodus 20:8), while in the book of Deuteronomy it is said: <b>“Observe</b> Shabbat and sanctify it” (Deuteronomy 5:12). From these two variants we can deduce that <b>anyone included in</b> the obligation to <b>observe</b> Shabbat by avoiding its desecration, <b>is</b> also <b>included in</b> the mitzva to <b>remember</b> Shabbat by reciting <i>kiddush</i>. <b>Since these women are included in</b> the mitzva <b>to observe</b> Shabbat, as there is no distinction between men and women in the obligation to observe prohibitions in general and to refrain from the desecration of Shabbat in particular, so too <b>are they included in</b> the mitzva of <b>remembering</b> Shabbat.",
    "<b>Ravina said to Rava:</b> We learned in the mishna that <b>women</b> are obligated in the mitzva of <b>Grace after Meals.</b> However, are they obligated <b>by Torah law</b> or merely <b>by rabbinic law? What difference does it make</b> whether it is by Torah or rabbinic law? The difference is regarding her ability <b>to fulfill the obligation of others</b> when reciting the blessing on their behalf. <b>Granted, if you say that</b> their obligation <b>is by Torah law,</b> one whose obligation <b>is by Torah law can come and fulfill the obligation</b> of others who are obligated <b>by Torah law. However, if you say</b> that their obligation is <b>by rabbinic law,</b> then from the perspective of Torah law, women <b>are</b> considered to be <b>one who is not obligated, and</b> the general principle is that <b>one who is not obligated</b> to fulfill a particular mitzva <b>cannot fulfill the obligations of the many</b> in that mitzva. Therefore, it is important to know <b>what</b> is the resolution of this dilemma.",
    "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Actually they said</b> that <b>a son may recite a blessing</b> on behalf of <b>his father, and a slave may recite a blessing</b> on behalf of <b>his master, and a woman may recite a blessing</b> on behalf of <b>her husband, but the Sages said: May a curse come to a man</b> who, due to his ignorance, requires <b>his wife and children to recite a blessing on his behalf.</b>",
    "From here we may infer: <b>Granted, if you say that</b> their obligation <b>is by Torah law,</b> one whose obligation <b>is by Torah law can come and fulfill the obligation</b> of others who are obligated <b>by Torah law. However, if you say</b> that their obligation is <b>by rabbinic law,</b> can one who is obligated <b>by rabbinic law, come and fulfill the obligation</b> of one whose obligation is <b>by Torah law?</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges this proof: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> is <b>a minor obligated</b> by Torah law to perform mitzvot? Everyone agrees that a minor is exempt by Torah law, yet here the <i>baraita</i> said that he may recite a blessing on behalf of his father. There must be another way to explain the <i>baraita</i>. <b>With what we are dealing here? With a case where</b> his father <b>ate</b> a quantity of food that did not satisfy his hunger, a <b>measure</b> for which one is only obligated <b>by rabbinic law</b> to recite Grace after Meals. In that case, one whose obligation <b>is by rabbinic law can come and fulfill the obligation</b> of another whose obligation <b>is by rabbinic law.</b>",
    "After citing the <i>halakha</i> that one who eats a quantity of food that does not satisfy his hunger is obligated by rabbinic law to recite Grace after Meals, the Gemara cites a related homiletic interpretation. <b>Rav Avira taught, sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Ami, and sometimes he said it in the name</b> of <b>Rabbi Asi: The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, in Your Torah it is written:</b> “The great, mighty and awesome God <b>who favors no one and takes no bribe”</b> (Deuteronomy 10:17), <b>yet You,</b> nevertheless, <b>show favor to Israel, as it is written: “The Lord shall show favor to you</b> and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). <b>He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:10), meaning that there is no obligation to bless the Lord until one is satiated; <b>yet they are exacting with themselves</b> to recite Grace after Meals even if they have eaten <b>as much as an olive-bulk or an egg-bulk.</b> Since they go beyond the requirements of the law, they are worthy of favor.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Ezra the Scribe decreed that one who is ritually impure because of a seminal emission may not engage in matters of Torah until he has immersed in a ritual bath and purified himself. This <i>halakha</i> was accepted over the course of many generations; however, many disputes arose with regard to the Torah matters to which it applies. Regarding this, the mishna says: If the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> arrived and <b>one</b> is impure due to a <b>seminal emission,</b> he may <b>contemplate</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>in his heart, but neither recites the blessings preceding</b> <i>Shema</i>, <b>nor the blessings following it. Over food</b> which, after partaking, one is obligated by Torah law to recite a blessing, <b>one recites a blessing afterward, but one does not recite a blessing beforehand,</b> because the blessing recited prior to eating is a requirement by rabbinic law. <b>And</b> in all of these instances <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He recites a blessing beforehand and thereafter</b> in both the case of <i>Shema</i> and in the case of food.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ravina said: That is to say,</b> from the mishna that <b>contemplation is tantamount to speech. As if it would enter your mind</b> that <b>it is not tantamount to speech,</b> then <b>why</b> does one who is impure because of a seminal emission <b>contemplate?</b> It must be that it is tantamount to speech.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>But what</b> are you saying, that <b>contemplation is tantamount to speech?</b> Then, if one who is impure because of a seminal emission is permitted to contemplate, why does he not <b>utter</b> the words <b>with his lips?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>As we found at</b> Mount <b>Sinai.</b> There one who had sexual relations with a woman was required to immerse himself before receiving the Torah, which was spoken and not merely contemplated. Here, too, it was decreed that one who was impure due to a seminal emission may not recite matters of Torah out loud until he immerses himself.",
    "<b>And Rav Ḥisda said</b> that the opposite conclusion should be drawn from the mishna: <b>Contemplation is not tantamount to speech, as if it would enter your mind</b> that <b>contemplation is tantamount to speech,</b> then one who is impure because of a seminal emission should <i>ab initio</i>, <b>utter</b> <i>Shema</i> <b>with his lips.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges this argument: <b>But what</b> are you saying, that <b>contemplation is not tantamount to speech?</b> If so, <b>why does he contemplate? Rabbi Elazar said: So that</b> a situation <b>will not</b> arise <b>where everyone is engaged in</b> reciting <i>Shema</i> <b>and he sits idly</b> by.",
    "The Gemara asks: If that is the only purpose, <b>let him study another chapter</b> and not specifically <i>Shema</i> or one of the blessings. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> It is fitting that one engage <b>in a matter in which the community is engaged.</b>"
