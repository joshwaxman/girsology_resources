    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> in effect <b>with regard to offerings of an individual that are not</b> in effect <b>with regard to communal offerings; and there are</b> <i>halakhot</i> in effect <b>with regard to communal offerings that are not</b> in effect <b>with regard to offerings of an individual.</b> The mishna elaborates: There are <i>halakhot</i> in effect with regard to offerings of an individual that are not in effect with regard to communal offerings, <b>as offerings of an individual render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for the offering <b>a substitute, and communal offerings do not render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for the offering <b>a substitute.</b>",
    "<b>Offerings of an individual apply to,</b> i.e., can be brought from, <b>both males and females, but communal offerings apply only to males.</b> If <b>offerings of an individual</b> were not brought at the appropriate time, one is <b>obligated to</b> bring <b>their compensation and compensation</b> for <b>their</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations</b> at a later date, <b>but</b> if <b>communal offerings</b> were not brought at the appropriate time, one is <b>obligated to</b> bring <b>neither their compensation nor compensation</b> for <b>their</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations</b> at a later date. <b>But</b> one is <b>obligated to</b> bring <b>compensation</b> for <b>their</b> accompanying meal offering and <b>libations once the offering is sacrificed.</b>",
    "<b>There are</b> <i>halakhot</i> in effect <b>with regard to communal offerings that are not</b> in effect <b>with regard to offerings of an individual, as communal offerings override Shabbat,</b> in that they are sacrificed on Shabbat, <b>and</b> they override <b>ritual impurity,</b> i.e., they are sacrificed even if the priests are impure with impurity imparted by a corpse; <b>and offerings of an individual override neither Shabbat nor ritual impurity.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Meir said: But aren’t the High Priest’s griddle-cake</b> offerings <b>and the bull of Yom Kippur offerings of an individual, and</b> yet <b>they override Shabbat and ritual impurity. Rather,</b> this is the principle: Any offering, individual or communal, <b>whose time is fixed</b> overrides Shabbat and ritual impurity, whereas any offering, individual or communal, whose time is not fixed overrides neither Shabbat nor ritual impurity.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that <b>offerings of an individual render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for the offering <b>a substitute.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is <b>this</b> an established <b>principle?</b> Does every offering of an individual render a non-sacred animal exchanged for it a substitute? <b>But</b> what about <b>birds,</b> i.e., a dove or a pigeon, <b>which</b> are brought as <b>an offering of an individual, but they do not render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for them <b>a substitute?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that offerings of an individual render a non-sacred animal exchanged for the offering a substitute, it <b>is teaching</b> this only <b>with regard to an animal</b> offering, not a bird offering.",
    "The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> what about the <b>offspring</b> of a sanctified animal, <b>which is</b> brought and sacrificed on the altar as <b>an offering of an individual</b> of the same type as its mother, <b>and</b> yet it <b>does not render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for it <b>a substitute?</b> The Gemara explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>the offspring</b> of a sanctified animal <b>renders</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for it <b>a substitute.</b>",
    "The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> what about <b>a substitute itself, which is</b> brought and sacrificed on the altar as <b>an offering of an individual, and</b> yet <b>a substitute does not render</b> a non-sacred animal exchanged for it <b>a substitute?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that an offering of an individual renders a non-sacred animal exchanged for it a substitute, it <b>is teaching</b> this only <b>with regard to the primary offering,</b> not a substitute of an offering.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> answer, <b>you</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda and maintain that the offspring of an offering does not render a non-sacred animal exchanged for it a substitute. The reason is that one can explain that the mishna <b>is teaching</b> its <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to the primary offering,</b> not the offspring of an offering.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>Offerings of an individual apply to,</b> i.e., can be brought from, <b>both males and females.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> this an established <b>principle,</b> that all offerings of an individual may be brought from either a male or female animal? <b>But</b> what about <b>a burnt offering, which is an offering of an individual, and</b> yet it <b>comes</b> as <b>a male</b> animal but does <b>not come</b> as <b>a female</b> animal.",
    "The Gemara answers that <b>there is a bird burnt offering,</b> i.e., there is a type of burnt offering that can be either a female or male bird. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The requirement of <b>unblemished status and</b> the requirement of <b>male status</b> both apply to a sacrificial <b>animal</b> brought as a burnt offering, <b>but</b> the requirement of <b>unblemished status and</b> the requirement of <b>male status</b> do <b>not</b> apply to sacrificial <b>birds</b> brought as burnt offerings.",
    "The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> what about <b>a sin offering, which is an offering of an individual, and</b> yet <b>comes</b> as <b>a female</b> animal but does <b>not come</b> as <b>a male</b> animal. The Gemara explains: Although burnt offerings of an individual must be female, <b>there is the goat sin offering of a king, which</b> is sacrificed by a specific individual and <b>is brought</b> specifically as <b>a male</b> animal.",
    "The Gemara further objects: <b>But there is</b> the <b>individual guilt offering, which comes</b> as <b>a male</b> animal but does <b>not come</b> as <b>a female</b> animal. The Gemara explains: <b>When the Sages stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna they were referring only to <b>an offering that is equivalent,</b> i.e., which is brought <b>both</b> as <b>an offering of an individual and</b> as <b>a communal</b> offering, whereas <b>a guilt offering is</b> brought as <b>an offering of an individual</b> but <b>is not</b> brought as <b>a communal</b> offering. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead an alternative explanation: <b>Does</b> the mishna <b>teach: All offerings</b> may be brought as either male or female? It does not. Rather, the mishna <b>teaches: There are offerings</b> of an individual that may be brought as male or female; <b>and what are they? Peace offerings; and</b> in the case of such an offering, <b>if</b> one <b>wants he brings a female</b> animal <b>and if</b> he <b>wants he brings a male</b> animal.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: If <b>offerings of an individual</b> were not brought at the appropriate time, one is <b>obligated to</b> bring <b>their compensation</b> and compensation for their accompanying meal offering and libations at a later date, whereas if communal offerings were not brought at the appropriate time, one is obligated to bring neither their compensation nor compensation for their accompanying meal offering and libations at a later date. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>, that if a communal offering was not sacrificed at the appropriate time it is not brought at a later stage?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states in the section of the Torah dealing with additional offerings: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire to the Lord, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and libations, <b>each day</b> on its own day” (Leviticus 23:37). This <b>teaches that the entire day is fit for</b> bringing the <b>additional</b> offerings. The term: <b>“On its own day,” teaches that if the day has passed and</b> the priests <b>did not bring</b> the additional offerings, <b>one is not obligated to</b> bring <b>their compensation,</b> and the offering cannot be brought at a later date.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one should not be obligated to</b> bring <b>compensation</b> for <b>their</b> accompanying <b>libations</b> at a later date <b>even if the</b> additional <b>offering has been sacrificed,</b> e.g., if there were no meal offerings or libations available at that time. Therefore, <b>the verse states,</b> in the chapter dealing with the additional offerings of the Festivals: <b>“Their meal offerings and their libations”</b> (Numbers 29:37). It is derived from here that the meal offerings and libations which are brought with the additional animal offerings of the Festivals can be sacrificed even <b>in the night</b> after the animal offering. The phrase <b>“their meal offerings and their libations”</b> further teaches that these meal offerings and libations can be sacrificed even <b>on the following day.</b>",
    "<b>Reish Lakish said</b> that the source is from the following verse: “These are the appointed seasons of the Lord, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the Lord…each on its own day; <b>beside the <i>Shabbatot</i> of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:37–38). The verse is expounded as speaking of a Festival that occurred on a Sunday, and therefore it is teaching that the meal offerings and libations for the additional offerings of the previous Shabbat may be brought on the following Festival day.",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara notes that both verses are <b>necessary, as if the Merciful One had written</b> only the verse: <b>“Beside the <i>Shabbatot</i> of the Lord,” I would say</b> that <b>on the day</b> following Shabbat, <b>yes,</b> one may bring the offerings, <b>but on the night</b> after Shabbat, <b>no,</b> one may not bring them, just as the offering itself could not have been brought at night. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And their meal offerings and their libations.” And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“Their meal offerings and their libations,” and not written: “Beside the <i>Shabbatot</i> of the Lord,” I would say</b> that <b>at night, yes,</b> the offerings may be brought, <b>but on the</b> following <b>day</b> they may <b>not</b> be brought.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> the night <b>different from</b> the day, that one might have thought the outstanding meal offerings and libations may be brought only at night but not during the day? The Gemara explains <b>that</b> one might have thought so because <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals and offerings the <b>night follows the day.</b> Therefore, the Torah had to teach that the meal offering and libations may be brought even the following day. The Gemara concludes that indeed both verses <b>are necessary.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And libations, may they be sacrificed at night? Didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items that are normally sacrificed at night, for example, the limbs</b> of a burnt offering <b>and the fats</b> of burnt offerings and other offerings, <b>that one sacrifices</b> them <b>after sunset and they are consumed throughout the entire night.</b> This is derived from the verse: “This is the law of the burnt offering: It is that which goes up on its firewood upon the altar all night unto the morning” (Leviticus 6:2).",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: But with regard to <b>items that are normally sacrificed in the day, for example the handful</b> of the meal offering, and <b>the frankincense, and the meal offering</b> that accompanies <b>the libations,</b> from where is it derived <b>that one may bring them up</b> and burn them <b>after sunset?</b> The Gemara asks: Would it <b>enter your mind</b> that they may be burned <b>after sunset? But didn’t you say</b> that these are <b>items that are normally sacrificed in the day? Rather,</b> the question of the <i>baraita</i> is as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that these items may be sacrificed <b>with sunset,</b> i.e., just before sunset, <b>in</b> which case <b>they are consumed throughout the entire night</b> and not during the day? <b>The verse states: “This is the law of the burnt offering”</b> (Leviticus 6:2), a phrase that <b>included</b> everything sacrificed on the altar.",
    "The Gemara reiterates its previous difficulty: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the meal offering that accompanies the <b>libations</b> is brought only <b>in the day,</b> not at night. <b>Rami bar Ḥama said</b> that this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the verse states: “Their meal offerings and libations,” it is referring <b>to consecrating</b> the offering if one placed it in a consecrated utensil at night. The offering becomes consecrated and may not be used for non-sacred purposes. <b>There,</b> in the verse cited by the <i>baraita</i> as teaching that it may be brought only in the day and not at night, it is referring <b>to sacrificing</b> the offering on the altar. Even if an offering was consecrated at night, it may not be sacrificed until the following morning.",
    "<b>Rava said to</b> Rami bar Ḥama: <b>If</b> the meal offering accompanying the libations <b>can be consecrated</b> at night, it should also be fit <b>to be sacrificed</b> at night. No distinction can be made between consecrating and sacrificing, as <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>This is the principle: Any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed in the day is consecrated only in the day; and any</b> offering <b>that is sacrificed at night is consecrated</b> only <b>at night;</b> and any offering that is sacrificed <b>both in the day and at night is consecrated</b> both <b>in the day and at night. Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The meal offering accompanying the libations may be sacrificed at night, and therefore one should <b>delete from this <i>baraita</i></b> the item: Meal offering that accompanies <b>the libations,</b> from the list of the offerings that may not be brought at night.",
    "With regard to Rav Yosef’s claim that the item: Meal offering that accompanies the libations, should be removed from the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara states: <b>When Rav Dimi ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rav Yirmeya sitting and saying in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: From where</b> is it derived that <b>libations that come with</b> an animal <b>offering may be sacrificed only in the day? The verse states:</b> “These you shall offer to the Lord in your appointed seasons, beside your vows, and your voluntary offerings, and your burnt offerings, and your meal offerings, <b>and your libations, and your peace offerings”</b> (Numbers 29:39). The juxtaposition of these two items teaches that <b>just as peace offerings</b> may be sacrificed only during <b>the day, so too libations</b> may be sacrificed only during <b>the day.</b>",
    "Rav Dimi <b>said</b> to Rav Yirmeya: <b>If I find</b> someone <b>who</b> can <b>write</b> this opinion in <b>a letter,</b> I will <b>send it to Rav Yosef</b> in Babylonia,"
