    "<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Similarly, Rabbi Yosei said:</b> It is stated with regard to those who returned from Babylonia in the days of Ezra: <b>“The children of the captivity that came out of exile sacrificed burnt offerings</b> to the God of Israel, <b>twelve bulls</b> for all Israel, <b>ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve goats for a sin offering; all this was a burnt offering unto the Lord”</b> (Ezra 8:35).",
    "The Gemara first analyzes this verse: <b>But is</b> it possible for <b>a sin offering</b> to be <b>sacrificed</b> as <b>a burnt offering? Rava said:</b> The verse means that it was all performed in the manner <b>of a burnt offering: Just as a burnt offering may not be eaten, so too,</b> that <b>sin offering</b> was <b>not eaten. As Rabbi Yosei would say: They brought these</b> twelve sin offerings <b>for</b> the sin of <b>idol worship; and Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> They were brought <b>for the</b> sin of <b>idol worship they committed in the days of</b> King <b>Zedekiah.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains the difficulty concerning which it cited this verse: It might <b>enter our mind</b> to think that <b>according to the one who holds</b> that <b>a communal sin offering whose owners achieved atonement</b> with another sin offering is left to <b>die,</b> he <b>also holds</b> that <b>a communal sin offering whose owners died</b> is left to <b>die. But here,</b> with regard to the offerings brought by the returning exiles, <b>this is</b> a case <b>of</b> a communal sin offering <b>whose owners died,</b> as the sin was committed in the time of Zedekiah, in the First Temple period, whereas the offerings were brought several generations later by those returning to rebuild the Second Temple. <b>And</b> yet <b>they were sacrificed.</b> This proves that a communal sin offering whose owners achieved atonement with another sin offering is not left to die.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in response: <b>Even according to the one who said</b> that <b>a communal sin offering whose owners achieved atonement</b> with another sin offering is left to <b>die,</b> he agrees that <b>a communal sin offering whose owners died is not</b> left to <b>die.</b> This is <b>because a community does not die.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where does Rav Pappa derive this</b> statement? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because it is written: “Your sons shall be instead of your fathers”</b> (Psalms 45:17), i.e., it is considered as though the fathers are alive, <b>if so,</b> then this should apply <b>even</b> to <b>an individual as well.</b> In other words, sons should be able to sacrifice the sin offerings of their late fathers.",
    "<b>Rather, this is</b> Rav Pappa’s <b>reasoning</b> for his statement <b>that a community does not die.</b> It is derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the goats</b> sacrificed on <b>pilgrimage Festivals and</b> on <b>New Moons, as the Merciful One states: Bring them from the</b> funds of the <b>collection of the</b> Temple treasury <b>chamber,</b> where they kept the half-shekels donated every year in the month of Adar, with which communal offerings were purchased. The Gemara explains: <b>But perhaps the owners of these coins</b> that were used to purchase these offerings <b>have died</b> in the meantime between the month of Adar and when the offerings are sacrificed throughout the year. If so, how can a sin offering be brought on behalf of some of its owners who have already died? <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> this <i>halakha</i> that <b>a community does not die?</b>",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a different answer in response to the earlier difficulty: The sin offerings for idolatry brought by the returning exiles were not in fact sacrificed for people who had died. Rather, <b>when they sacrificed these sin offerings</b> for the idolatry committed in the time of Zedekiah, <b>they sacrificed them for the living,</b> i.e., for those survivors who had worshipped idols in the time of Zedekiah and were still alive many decades later and had returned to rebuild the Second Temple. <b>As it is written: “But many of the priests, Levites, and heads of fathers’ houses, the old men that had seen the first house standing on its foundation, wept with a loud voice when this house</b> was before their eyes; <b>and many shouted aloud</b> for joy” (Ezra 3:12).",
    "The Gemara objects: <b>But perhaps those</b> who remained and remembered the First Temple were <b>the minority,</b> in which case they should have each brought individual sin offerings, rather than a communal sin offering. The fact that they brought communal sacrifices indicates that the sin offering was not brought only on behalf of those few who remained. The Gemara explains: <b>You cannot say</b> that they were the minority, <b>as it is written</b> in the following verse: <b>“So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people;</b> for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off” (Ezra 3:13). This verse shows that the people who cried because they remembered the First Temple were not a small minority.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But how could they sacrifice</b> sin offerings for the sin of idolatry? After all, <b>they were intentional</b> idol worshippers, and a sin offering is brought only by one who sins unwittingly. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in response: <b>It was a provisional edict</b> issued in exigent circumstances, according to which they were permitted to bring sin offerings even for intentional sins.",
    "The Gemara adds that <b>this also stands to reason, as, if you do not say so,</b> one can object as follows: <b>Granted,</b> they sacrificed twelve <b>bulls and goats,</b> since each tribe must bring a communal sin offering, as stated in the Torah (Numbers, chapter 15), and these offerings <b>correspond to</b> the <b>twelve tribes. But to what</b> do <b>the</b> ninety-six <b>sheep correspond? Rather,</b> it must be that <b>it was a provisional edict.</b>",
    "§ Earlier the Gemara mentioned the <i>halakha</i> of a sin offering whose owner died, which was one of the <i>halakhot</i> forgotten during the mourning period for Moses (see 16a). On this topic the Gemara says that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Sota</i> 47a): <b>From</b> the time <b>when Yosef ben Yo’ezer of Tzereida and Yosef ben Yoḥanan of Jerusalem died, the clusters [<i>eshkolot</i>] ceased,</b> i.e., they were the last of the clusters. The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of <i>eshkolot</i>? It means <b>a man who contains all [<i>ish shehakol bo</i>],</b> i.e., both Torah and mitzvot.",
    "<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: All</b> the <b>clusters who stood</b> at the head <b>of the Jewish people, from the days of Moses until Yosef ben Yo’ezer died, would study Torah</b> in the manner <b>of Moses, our teacher. From that</b> point <b>forward they would not study Torah</b> in the manner <b>of Moses, our teacher.</b>",
    "The Gemara objects: <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Three thousand <i>halakhot</i> were forgotten during the days of mourning for Moses.</b> This suggests that the Sages who came immediately after Moses did not study Torah in the same manner as Moses. The Gemara answers: Those <i>halakhot</i> <b>that they forgot, were forgotten, but</b> with regard to those <i>halakhot</i> <b>that they studied, they would</b> continue to <b>study</b> in the manner <b>of Moses, our teacher.</b>",
    "The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the resolution of questions of <i>halakha</i>: <b>From</b> the time <b>when Moses died, if the majority deem</b> an item <b>impure, they</b> have established it as <b>impure,</b> and <b>if the majority deem</b> an item <b>pure, they</b> have established it as <b>pure.</b> If this is the case, then the manner of studying Torah after the death of Moses is based on a majority, whereas when Moses was alive there was no dispute in matters of <i>halakha</i>.",
    "The Gemara explains that this <i>baraita</i> is referring specifically to those <i>halakhot</i> that were forgotten during the mourning period after the death of Moses. Since the understanding of <b>the heart was limited [<i>libba de’ime’it</i>],</b> the Sages were unable to reach a clear ruling on these matters. Consequently, they had to follow the majority. But with regard to all other <i>halakhot</i> <b>they studied, they would study them</b> in the manner <b>of Moses, our teacher.</b>",
    "<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: All</b> the <b>clusters who stood</b> at the head <b>of the Jewish people from the days of Moses until Yosef ben Yo’ezer died had no flaw in them. From this</b> point <b>forward</b> the clusters, i.e., the leadership of the Jewish people, <b>had flaws in them.</b>",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a certain pious man who was groaning,</b> i.e., suffering, <b>due to</b> a pain in <b>his heart. And they asked the physicians</b> what to do for him, <b>and they said: There is no other remedy for him but that he should suckle warm milk</b> every <b>morning. And they brought</b> him <b>a goat and tied it to the leg of the bed for him, and he would suckle milk from it.</b>",
    "<b>On the following day, his friends entered to visit him. When they saw the goat</b> tied to the leg of the bed <b>they said:</b> There is <b>an armed bandit in this</b> man’s <b>house, and we are entering to visit him?</b> They referred to the goat in this manner because small animals habitually graze on the vegetation of neighbors, stealing their crops. The Sages <b>sat and examined</b> this pious man’s behavior, <b>and they could not find</b> any <b>transgression</b> attributable <b>to him other than</b> the sin <b>of</b> keeping <b>that goat</b> in his house <b>alone.</b>",
    "<b>And that</b> man himself <b>also said at the time of his death: I know</b> for a fact <b>with regard to myself that I have no transgression</b> attributable <b>to me but</b> the sin <b>of</b> keeping <b>that goat</b> in my house <b>alone, as I transgressed the statement of my colleagues,</b> the Sages. <b>As the Sages said</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 79b): <b>One may not raise small domesticated animals,</b> i.e., sheep and goats, <b>in</b> inhabited areas of <b>Eretz Yisrael,</b> because they graze on people’s crops.",
    "<b>And we maintain</b> that <b>anywhere that it says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain pious</b> man, the man in question is <b>either Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava or Rabbi Yehuda bar Ilai. And</b> these <b>Sages</b> lived <b>many generations after Yosef ben Yo’ezer of Tzereida.</b> If this is the case, then even in later generations there were Sages without a flaw."
