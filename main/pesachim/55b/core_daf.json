    "<b>one completes it on the fourteenth. When</b> is that the case? It is <b>when he initiated</b> the labor <b>prior to the fourteenth. However,</b> if <b>he did not initiate</b> the labor <b>prior to the fourteenth, he should not initiate it on the fourteenth, even</b> if it is only manufacturing <b>a small belt or even a small hairnet.</b> The Gemara analyzes this: When it is <b>for the purpose of the Festival, yes,</b> one may complete this labor. However, when it is <b>not for the purpose of the Festival, no,</b> one may not complete it, in accordance with the third possibility above. The Gemara rejects this analysis: Actually, <b>the same is true; we</b> may <b>also complete</b> the task <b>even when it is not for the purpose of</b> the Festival. <b>And this</b> comes to <b>teach us that even</b> when it is <b>for the purpose of the Festival, completing</b> a labor, <b>yes,</b> one may do so, but <b>initiating</b> a labor, <b>no,</b> one may not, in accordance with the third aforementioned possibility.",
    "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> yet another resolution to the dilemma. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>any labor that is for the purpose of the Festival, one</b> may <b>complete it on the fourteenth, and</b> if it <b>is not for the purpose of the Festival, it is prohibited</b> to complete it. <b>And one</b> may <b>perform labor on Passover eves until midday in a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed</b> to do so. The Gemara infers: In a <b>place where</b> people <b>were accustomed</b> to perform labor, <b>yes,</b> one may do so. However, in a place <b>where</b> people <b>were not accustomed</b> to perform labor, <b>no,</b> one may not do so. <b>And learn from it</b> that <b>for the purpose of the Festival, yes,</b> one may perform labor. However, if it is <b>not for the purpose of the Festival, no,</b> one may not do so, in accordance with the first aforementioned possibility. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is so.",
    "It was stated in the mishna that <b>the Rabbis say:</b> The practitioners of only <b>three crafts</b> are permitted to perform labor until midday on Passover eve. <b>It was taught</b> in explanation of their opinion: <b>The tailors</b> may perform labor on Passover eve, <b>as a layperson</b> is permitted to <b>sew in his</b> usual <b>manner during the intermediate days</b> of the Festival. Since this type of labor is permitted during the intermediate days, when the prohibition against labor is more stringent than on Passover eve, one may be lenient on Passover eve as well. <b>Barbers and launderers,</b> may perform labor on Passover eve, <b>as one who arrives from a country overseas or one who leaves prison</b> who did not have time to cut their hair or launder their clothing before the Festival <b>may cut their hair and wash</b> their clothing <b>on the intermediate days</b> of the Festival. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Shoemakers</b> may <b>also</b> perform their labor, <b>because Festival pilgrims</b> may <b>repair their shoes during the intermediate days of the Festival.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do the Rabbis and Rabbi Yosei <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: We learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the initiation of labor from the</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>conclusion of labor;</b> if it is permitted to repair shoes, it is also permitted to initiate their production. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds: We cannot learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the initiation of labor from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the conclusion of labor;</b> therefore, although it is permitted to repair shoes, it is prohibited to produce new ones.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> This mishna continues the discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover eve. <b>One may place eggs under hens</b> on the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan so that the birds will brood until the eggs hatch. <b>And</b> if a <b>hen fled</b> from brooding, <b>one</b> may <b>restore it to its place. And if</b> a brooding hen <b>died, one</b> may <b>place another in its stead.</b> Similarly, <b>one may sweep</b> dung <b>from beneath the legs of an animal</b> on <b>the fourteenth</b> of Nisan. <b>And during</b> the intermediate days of the <b>Festival one may clear</b> it <b>to the sides.</b> Similarly, <b>one</b> may <b>take vessels to the craftsman’s house</b> for repair <b>and bring</b> others from there <b>even though they are not for the purpose of the Festival.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Now,</b> the mishna stated that <b>placing</b> a brooding hen to sit on eggs is permitted; <b>is it necessary</b> to mention that <b>restoring</b> a hen to its brooding place is permitted? <b>Abaye said: In the last clause</b> of the mishna <b>we have arrived at</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the <b>intermediate days</b> of the Festival, when placing a hen to sit on eggs is prohibited, yet one may nevertheless restore a hen that fled, as failure to do so will cause him to incur a loss. On the fourteenth of Nisan, one may even place a hen to brood <i>ab initio</i>.",
    "<b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> that one may restore the hen to the eggs <b>only</b> when it is within <b>three days of its rebellion,</b> when the hen fled from its place, <b>as the heat has not yet</b> completely <b>dissipated</b> from the hen, so that restoring the hen to its place to resume its brooding will be effective; furthermore, this <i>halakha</i> applies only if it is also at least <b>three</b> days <b>after</b> the hen began <b>sitting, when</b> failure to restore the hen to sit on the eggs will cause <b>the eggs</b> to be <b>totally ruined,</b> as on the one hand they are no longer edible, and on the other hand the chick in the egg is only partially formed. <b>However,</b> if it is more than <b>three</b> days <b>after its rebellion, when its heat has</b> completely <b>dissipated, or within three</b> days <b>from when it</b> began <b>sitting, when</b> failure to restore the hen to sit on the eggs will <b>not</b> yet cause <b>the eggs</b> to be <b>totally ruined, one</b> may <b>not restore</b> the hen to sit on the eggs. <b>Rabbi Ami said: Even within three</b> days <b>from when it began sitting, one</b> may <b>restore</b> the hen to sit on the eggs.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do Rav Huna and Rabbi Ami <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Huna, <b>holds</b> that with regard <b>to a major loss,</b> the Sages <b>were concerned</b> about the eggs being completely ruined, and therefore one may restore the hen to its place only if it had already sat on the eggs for three or more days. With regard <b>to a minor loss</b> of being forced to sell at a discount the unhatched eggs that were incubated for less than three days, <b>they were not concerned. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ami, <b>holds</b> that with regard <b>to a minor loss, they were also concerned,</b> and therefore the Sages permitted one to restore the hen to its place during the intermediate days of the Festival.",
    "It was stated in the mishna: <b>One may sweep</b> the dung <b>from beneath</b> the legs of an animal on the fourteenth of Nisan. <b>The Sages taught</b> in greater detail in the <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to <b>the dung in a courtyard, one</b> may <b>clear it to the sides,</b> and with regard to the dung <b>that is in the barn and in a courtyard, one may take it out to the garbage</b> dump.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> matter <b>itself is difficult.</b> On the one hand, <b>you said:</b> With regard to <b>the dung in a courtyard, one</b> may <b>clear it to the sides,</b> from which it may be inferred that one may not take it out to the garbage dump. <b>And then it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: With regard to the dung <b>that is in the barn and in a courtyard, one may take it out to the garbage</b> dump. <b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the Sages permitted taking out the dung to the garbage dump, it refers to the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan. <b>There,</b> where they permitted only moving it to the sides, it refers <b>to</b> the <b>intermediate days of the Festival. Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case refer <b>to</b> the <b>intermediate days, and this is</b> what <b>it is saying:</b> In an ordinary courtyard one may only move the dung to the sides; however, <b>if the courtyard becomes</b> as filthy <b>as a barn, one</b> may <b>take out</b> the dung <b>to the garbage</b> dump.",
    "It was stated in the mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>take vessels to the craftsman’s house</b> for repair <b>and bring</b> others from there. <b>Rav Pappa said: Rava tested us. We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One</b> may <b>take vessels</b> to <b>the craftsman’s house</b> for repair <b>and bring</b> others <b>from</b> there <b>even if they are not for the purpose of the Festival.</b> He <b>raised a contradiction</b> from that which we learned: <b>One</b> may <b>not bring vessels from a craftsman’s house, and if he is concerned lest they be stolen, he may move them to another courtyard</b> belonging to the craftsman, but not to his own house.",
    "<b>And we answered:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where one may bring vessels from the craftsman’s house, it is referring to the <b>fourteenth</b> of Nisan. <b>There,</b> where one may not bring them, it is referring <b>to the intermediate days</b> of the Festival. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this and that</b> are referring <b>to the intermediate days, and</b> nevertheless, this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where one may not bring them home, it is referring to a case where <b>he trusts</b> that the craftsman will return the items; <b>there,</b> where it is permitted to take the vessels home, it is referring to a case where <b>he does not trust him.</b>",
    "<b>As it</b> was <b>taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> may <b>bring vessels from the house of a craftsman, such as a jug from the house of a potter, or a cup from the house of a glassmaker, but</b> one may bring <b>neither wool from the house of a dyer nor</b> other <b>vessels from the house of a craftsman</b> that are not for the purpose of the Festival. <b>And if</b> the craftsman <b>has nothing to eat, one gives</b> the craftsman <b>his payment</b> on the intermediate days of the Festival <b>and leaves</b> the item <b>with him. And if he does not trust</b> that the craftsman will deliver the items, <b>he leaves them in the adjacent house. And if he is concerned lest</b> the item <b>be stolen, he</b> may <b>bring them to his house surreptitiously.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>You have resolved</b> the issue of <b>bringing</b> items from a craftsman’s house, but <b>taking</b> items to his house is <b>difficult, as it was taught: One</b> may <b>not bring, and all the more so one may not take</b> items to be repaired. Therefore, the Gemara rejects the second answer and concludes: <b>Rather, it is clear as we answered initially,</b> i.e., the <i>baraita</i> refers to the intermediate days and the mishna refers to Passover eve.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna continues the discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of Passover eve, along with other local customs. <b>Six actions were performed by the</b> Jewish <b>residents of Jericho,</b> contrary to common practice. With regard <b>to three,</b> the Sages <b>reprimanded them, and</b> with regard <b>to three,</b> the Sages <b>did not reprimand them. And these are the ones</b> with regard to <b>which they did not reprimand them:</b> The residents of Jericho would <b>graft palm trees the entire day</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan; <b>and</b> they would <b>bundle <i>Shema</i>,</b> as explained in the Gemara; <b>and</b> they would <b>harvest and pile</b> grain <b>before the <i>omer</i></b> offering was brought. <b>And these are the ones</b> with regard to which the Sages <b>reprimanded them:</b> They would <b>permit</b> the use of <b>consecrated branches</b> of carob or sycamore trees. This refers to trees whose branches were cut and consecrated for Temple upkeep, which subsequently sprouted new branches;"
