    "<b>and I will burn</b> it <b>from the outside,</b> to consume those who threw the three righteous men into the furnace; <b>and I will</b> thereby <b>perform a miracle within a miracle. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: Descend. At that time Gabriel began</b> praising God <b>and recited: “And the truth of the Lord endures forever”</b> (Psalms 117:2), as God fulfilled His promise to him from more than a thousand years earlier.",
    "<b>Rabbi Natan says: “And the truth of the Lord endures forever”</b> was actually <b>recited by the fish in the sea, in accordance with</b> a statement of <b>Rav Huna.</b> As <b>Rav Huna said: The Jewish people of that generation,</b> during the Exodus, <b>were of little faith. And</b> this statement <b>is as Rabba bar Mari taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “But they were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea”</b> (Psalms 106:7)? This <b>teaches that the Jews rebelled</b> against Moses <b>at that time, and said:</b> Perhaps, <b>just as we</b> are <b>ascending from one side, so too the Egyptians</b> are <b>ascending from</b> the <b>other side,</b> and we will not be saved.",
    "<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the ministering angel of the sea: Spew out</b> the dead Egyptians <b>onto dry land.</b> The sea <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe, is there a servant whose master gives him a gift and then takes it from him?</b> Since the dead Egyptians were given to me for my fish to eat, how can God retract His gift? <b>He said to him: I will give you one and a half</b> times <b>their</b> number. Although I am taking them back now, later I will give you one and a half times as many people.",
    "<b>He said to him: Master of the Universe, can a servant issue a claim against his master</b> for a gift promised to him? Who will be my guarantor? <b>He said to him: The Kishon River will be a guarantor for Me. Immediately,</b> the sea <b>spewed them out onto the land, and the Jewish people came and saw</b> that <b>they</b> were dead. <b>As it is stated: “And Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore”</b> (Exodus 14:30).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>one and a half</b> times <b>their</b> number? How was God’s promise fulfilled? The Gemara answers: <b>While, with regard to Pharaoh, it is written: “Six hundred chosen chariots”</b> (Exodus 14:7), <b>whereas, with regard to Sisera, it is written: “Nine hundred iron chariots”</b> (Judges 4:13).",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>When Sisera came</b> to fight Israel, <b>he came upon them with iron spears,</b> whereupon <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, removed the stars from their orbits</b> to fight <b>against</b> Sisera’s army, <b>as it is written: “They fought from heaven, the stars</b> in their courses fought against Sisera” (Judges 5:20). <b>Since the stars fell on them, these iron spears heated up</b> and <b>they went to cool them and wash themselves in the Kishon River.</b>",
    "At this point, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Kishon River: Go and pay your guarantee</b> that you issued to the ministering angel of the sea. <b>Immediately, the Kishon River swept them away and cast them into the sea, as it is stated: “The Kishon River swept them away, that ancient river”</b> (Judges 5:21). <b>What is</b> the meaning of the expression: <b>“ancient river”?</b> The Gemara explains: This is referring to <b>the river that was appointed a guarantor from ancient</b> times. <b>At that time, the fish of the sea began</b> praising God <b>and recited: “And the truth of the Lord endures forever,”</b> in reference to God’s fulfillment of the promise He issued centuries earlier.",
    "The Gemara cites more <i>midrashim</i> on the verses of <i>hallel</i>. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Who makes the barren woman dwell in her house</b> as a joyful mother of children, <i>halleluya</i>” (Psalms 113:9)? <b>The Congregation of Israel,</b> i.e., the leaders of the Jewish people, <b>said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> due to their sins, <b>Your children treat me like this rat that dwells in the vaults of houses,</b> barely able to find a place in the house.",
    "<b>Rava taught: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “I love that the Lord should hear</b> my voice and my supplications” (Psalms 116:1)? <b>The Congregation of Israel said: Master of the Universe, when am I beloved by You,</b> and I know that I am loved? <b>When You hear the voice of my supplications. “I was brought low, and He saved me”</b> (Psalms 116:6). <b>The Congregation of Israel said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, although I am lowly in mitzvot,</b> as I do not always fulfill them properly, <b>I am Yours,</b> and therefore <b>it is fitting</b> that <b>I</b> should <b>be saved.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Kahana said: When Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, fell ill, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>sent</b> a message <b>to him: Tell us two or three matters that you said to us, citing your father.</b>",
    "<b>He sent</b> back <b>to him: My father said as follows: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Praise the Lord, all you nations,</b> laud Him all you peoples. For His mercy is great toward us, and the truth of the Lord endures forever, <i>halleluya</i>” (Psalms 117)? <b>What are the nations of the world doing</b> by praising God for His great mercies toward Israel? Rabbi Yosei explained: Rather, <b>this is</b> what the verse <b>is saying: “Praise the Lord, all you nations” for the mighty acts and the wonders that</b> God <b>performed before</b> their eyes. <b>All the more so we,</b> the recipients of these acts, should praise and thank Him, <b>as His mercy is great toward us.</b>",
    "<b>And furthermore,</b> Rabbi Yishmael sent another of his father’s teachings to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>In the future, Egypt will bring a gift to the Messiah</b> when all of the nations gather before him, as the verse says: “Out of Your temple at Jerusalem, where kings shall bring presents to you” (Psalms 68:30). The Messiah <b>will think</b> it appropriate <b>not to accept</b> gifts <b>from them,</b> as the Egyptians abused Israel. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will <b>say to the Messiah: Accept</b> their gifts <b>from them,</b> as <b>they granted lodging to My children in Egypt.</b> They lived there for many years before being enslaved. <b>Immediately, “Nobles shall come out of Egypt”</b> (Psalms 68:32).",
    "Upon seeing that Egypt’s gift has been accepted, Kush will want to bring a gift too. <b>Kush</b> will <b>draw an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>with regard to itself: Just as</b> the gifts of <b>these</b> Egyptians were accepted despite the fact that <b>they enslaved</b> the Jewish people, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that a gift from <b>me, who did not enslave them,</b> should be accepted? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will <b>say to</b> the Messiah: <b>Accept</b> it <b>from them. Immediately, “Kush shall hasten to stretch out her hands to God”</b> (Psalms 68:32).",
    "After that, <b>the wicked kingdom of Rome</b> will <b>draw an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>with regard to itself: Just as</b> the gifts of <b>these, who are not their brothers,</b> were accepted in this manner, <b>we,</b> the descendants of Edom, <b>who are their brothers, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that our gifts will be accepted? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> will <b>say to Gabriel: “Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds [<i>kaneh</i>],</b> the multitude of [<i>adat</i>] the bulls” (Psalms 68:31). <b>Rebuke the beast and acquire [<i>keneh</i>]</b> the <b>congregation [<i>eda</i>]</b> of Israel. The nation of Rome, which enslaved Israel in its current exile, is less worthy than the other two nations.",
    "<b>Alternatively,</b> the verse <b>“Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds,”</b> means rebuke the beast <b>that dwells between the reeds, as it is written: “The pig out of the wood ravages it, and that which moves in the field feeds on it”</b> (Psalms 80:14). This verse is referring to Edom, whose behavior is compared elsewhere to that of a pig.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the verse means: <b>Rebuke the beast, all of whose actions are written with a single quill.</b> <i>Kaneh</i> can mean a reed, or a quill. In other words, rebuke a nation that speaks of others in only one manner, for the worse. The verse continues: “The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples, everyone submitting himself with pieces of silver. He has scattered the peoples who delight in war” (Psalms 68:31). <b>“The multitude of the bulls [<i>abirim</i>], with the calves of the peoples”;</b> this is referring to Rome, <b>who slaughtered mighty people [<i>abirim</i>] like ownerless calves.</b>",
    "<b>“Everyone submitting himself with pieces of silver,”</b> means <b>that</b> the officials of Rome <b>open their hands to receive money</b> as bribes or taxes, <b>but</b> actually they <b>do not perform the will of their masters,</b> as they cannot be trusted even in this regard. <b>“He has scattered the peoples who delight in war”; what caused the Jewish people to be scattered among the nations of the world? The intimacies that they desired with them.</b> Their exile among the nations was caused by their attraction to the customs and behavior of gentiles.",
    "<b>And</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>further sent to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: There were <b>365 markets in the great city of Rome, and each and every one</b> of them <b>contained 365 towers, and each and every tower contained 365 floors, and each and every floor contained enough</b> food <b>to sustain the entire world.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> also <b>said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and some say</b> that he said <b>it to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei: For whom</b> did they store all <b>this</b> food? He replied: <b>For you and your colleagues and the colleagues of your colleagues,</b> i.e., for the Jewish people and their Sages, <b>as it is stated: “Her grain and her hire shall be consecrated to the Lord; it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her gain shall be for those who dwell before the Lord,</b> to eat their fill, and for stately clothing” (Isaiah 23:18).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“It shall not be treasured”? Rav Yosef teaches: “It shall not be treasured,” this</b> is referring to items brought into <b>a storehouse; “nor laid up,” this</b> means <b>a treasury,</b> where valuable items were stored behind guarded walls. <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Who dwell before the Lord?” Rabbi Elazar said:</b>"
