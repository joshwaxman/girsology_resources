    "<b>who reached</b> physical <b>maturity, but had not</b> yet <b>reached the age</b> of majority, and women who sought to remove hair for cosmetic purposes: <b>They would smear daughters of the poor with lime; they would smear daughters of the wealthy with fine flour; they would smear daughters of kings with <i>shemen hamor</i>, as it was stated:</b> “For so were the days of their anointing filled, <b>six months with <i>shemen hamor</i>”</b> (Esther 2:12).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>shemen hamor</i>? Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya said: <i>Setaket</i>. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said:</b> It is <b>olive oil</b> extracted from an olive <b>that</b> has <b>not</b> yet <b>reached a third</b> of its growth; the acidic oil is effective as a depilatory.",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b><i>anpiknin</i></b> is <b>olive oil</b> from an olive <b>that has not reached a third</b> of its growth. <b>And why is it spread</b> on the body? It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it removes [<i>mashir</i>] the hair and pampers the skin.</b>",
    "The mishna states: <b>This is the principle:</b> One violates these prohibitions on Passover with <b>anything that is</b> prepared <b>from a type of grain. It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said: Now that we learned</b> that by possessing <b>anything that is a type of grain one violates</b> the prohibition against leaven <b>during Passover, why did the Sages list these</b> items individually? They could have simply stated the principle. The <i>baraita</i> explains that the Sages provided a list of prohibited foods <b>so that</b> one <b>would become familiar with these</b> items <b>and with their names,</b> so that it would become widely known that these foods contain a small quantity of grain.",
    "The Gemara cites an incident that underscores the significance of familiarity with the names of foods: <b>As in this</b> case <b>of that</b> man <b>from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, who <b>visited Babylonia,</b> and <b>had meat with him, he said to</b> his hosts: <b>Bring me a dip</b> with which to eat my bread. <b>He heard them saying: Bring him <i>kutaḥ</i>. Since he heard</b> the word <b><i>kutaḥ</i>, he stopped</b> eating, as he knew that <i>kutaḥ</i> contains milk and may not be eaten with meat. This incident underscores that it is advantageous for one to familiarize himself with the names and ingredients of different foods, so that he will be aware of the nature of the food even if he does not recognize it.",
    "It is stated in the mishna: <b>These</b> substances <b>are included in the prohibition</b> but are not punishable by <i>karet</i>.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who</b> maintains that both <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread in a mixture, and hardened</b> leaven, <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form, which is not suitable for consumption, are both included <b>in a prohibition?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Leavening</b> dough, i.e., dough that is at the beginning of the leavening process and is presently hardened leaven, must <b>be burned, or</b> one <b>gives it to his dog. And one who eats it</b> is flogged <b>with forty</b> lashes.",
    "Before analyzing the contents of the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara addresses an apparent contradiction within the <i>baraita</i>. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself is difficult. You said</b> that <b>leavening</b> dough must <b>be burned; apparently it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from hardened leaven. <b>And then it teaches: Or</b> one <b>gives it to his dog; apparently, it is permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the leaven.",
    "The Gemara answers that <b>this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Leavening</b> dough must <b>be burned,</b> i.e., leavening dough as defined <b>by Rabbi Meir</b> must be burned <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that leavening dough is full-fledged leaven. Alternatively, the <i>baraita</i> may be explained as referring to leavening dough as defined <b>by Rabbi Yehuda, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that it is prohibited to derive benefit from leavening dough. Each <i>tanna</i> maintains that it is prohibited to derive benefit from any dough classified as leavening dough by his definition. When the <i>baraita</i> says <b>that one gives it to his dog,</b> it means: Leavening dough as defined <b>by Rabbi Meir,</b> is only hardened leaven <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and therefore one may feed it to his dog. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that it is permitted to derive benefit from this type of leaven.",
    "With regard to the final statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>one who eats</b> leavening dough is flogged <b>with forty</b> lashes, <b>we have</b> once again <b>arrived at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> Rabbi Meir holds that one who eats this leavening dough, from which it is permitted to derive benefit according to Rabbi Yehuda, is flogged with forty lashes.",
    "According to this explanation of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we</b> have <b>learned</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> maintains that <b>hardened</b> leaven <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form, is included <b>in a prohibition,</b> and one who eats this leaven is flogged. <b>And all the more so,</b> one who eats <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread in a mixture</b> is flogged but does not receive <i>karet</i>, as he is not eating the leaven in and of itself. Nevertheless, the prohibition against eating leavened bread on Passover applies in that case.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For</b> eating <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread</b> one is <b>punishable</b> by <b><i>karet</i>,</b> whereas <b>for</b> eating <b>a mixture</b> that contains leaven one is punished merely <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say: For</b> eating <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread</b> one is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>;</b> however, <b>for</b> eating leaven in <b>its mixture</b> one is <b>not</b> punished <b>at all. And we learned according to Rabbi Eliezer, who said</b> that <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread in a mixture is</b> included <b>in a prohibition, and</b> that is true <b>all the more so</b> with regard to <b>hardened leaven in its pure,</b> unadulterated form.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> that the mishna is in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s ruling?",
    "The Gemara answers that Rav Naḥman could have <b>said to you</b> that the following distinction applies: <b>Perhaps Rabbi Meir stated</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> with regard to <b>hardened</b> leaven <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form; <b>however,</b> with regard to <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread in a mixture, no,</b> one is punished not with mere lashes but with <i>karet</i>.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> that the mishna is in accordance with Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling?",
    "The Gemara answers that Rav Yehuda could have <b>said to you: Rabbi Eliezer stated</b> his opinion <b>only there,</b> with regard to <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread in a mixture</b> that it is included in the prohibition. <b>However,</b> with regard to <b>hardened</b> leaven <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form, <b>he did not state</b> his ruling and perhaps Rabbi Eliezer maintains that it is permitted to eat hardened leaven.",
    "The Gemara notes that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> who said that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s opinion: <b>“You shall eat nothing leavened;</b> in all your dwellings you shall eat <i>matzot</i>” (Exodus 12:20). The Sages taught: This verse comes <b>to include Babylonian <i>kutaḥ</i>, Median beer, Edomite vinegar, and Egyptian <i>zitom</i>.</b> I <b>might</b> have thought that one who eats any of these items <b>will be punishable</b> by <b><i>karet</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “For whoever eats leavened bread…</b>that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from Israel” (Exodus 12:15), from which the Sages derived: <b>For</b> eating <b>full-fledged, leavened grain bread</b> one is <b>punished</b> with <b><i>karet</i>, but for</b> eating <b>its mixture</b> one is only in violation <b>of a prohibition.</b>",
    "The Gemara analyzes the above statement: <b>Whom did you hear that said that for</b> eating <b>a mixture</b> which contains leaven one is in violation <b>of a prohibition? It is Rabbi Eliezer. However,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is not stating</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>hardened</b> leaven <b>in its pure,</b> unadulterated form. This <i>baraita</i> lists only items that contain leaven in a mixture, but not other substances whose legal status is that of hardened leaven, e.g., broth, worked dough, and glue. <b>Learn from this that Rabbi Eliezer is not of</b> the opinion that <b>hardened</b> leaven is prohibited.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer, from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that leaven in <b>its mixture</b> is included <b>in a prohibition?</b> The Gemara answers that he derives it <b>as it is written: “You shall eat nothing leavened.”</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges this derivation: <b>If so,</b> if the expression: Anything leavened, includes leaven in a mixture, <b>let one also be liable to</b> receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for eating leaven in a mixture. <b>As it is written:</b> “Seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; <b>for whosoever eats anything [<i>kol</i>] leavened,</b> that soul <b>shall be cut off</b> from the people of Israel, whether he is a sojourner or one born in the land” (Exodus 12:19). Apparently, one is punished with <i>karet</i> for eating anything that contains leaven.",
    "The Gemara answers that Rabbi Eliezer <b>needs that</b> phrase: Anything leavened, in order to derive <b>for that which was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase: Anything <b>leavened, I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that an item <b>that became leavened on its own</b> is prohibited. However, <b>from where</b> do I derive that one is punished with <i>karet</i> for eating an item that became leavened <b>due to a different factor? The verse states:</b> “Whosoever eats <b>anything [<i>kol</i>] leavened…shall be cut off,”</b> indicating that food that became leavened due to a different factor is considered leavened bread.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the phrase: Anything leavened, is referring to food that became leavened by means of something else, then when this same phrase appears with regard <b>to</b> the <b>prohibition,</b> I should explain that it <b>comes for that</b> purpose <b>as well.</b> Consequently, there should be no violation for eating a mixture that contains leaven, as apparently, the phrase: Anything leavened, does not refer to that case at all.",
    "<b>Rather, the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is that he derives this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the term <b>anything [<i>kol</i>].</b> He does not derive his opinion from the term leavened; he bases his ruling on the inclusive term anything.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>There, too,</b> in the verse that mentions the punishment of <i>karet</i>, <b>isn’t it written:</b> “For <b>whosoever [<i>kol</i>]</b> eats anything leavened, that soul shall be cut off”? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer <b>requires that</b> term <b>to include women</b> who are also punishable by <i>karet</i> for eating leavened bread.",
    "The Gemara asks: Is this source necessary to derive this <i>halakha</i>? The fact that <b>women</b> may not eat leavened bread is <b>derived from</b> the statement that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and similarly,</b> the Sage in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: The verse said:</b> “Speak to the children of Israel: <b>A man or woman, when they commit any of the sins of men,</b> to commit a trespass against the Lord, and that soul shall be guilty” (Numbers 5:6). <b>The Torah rendered a man equal to a woman for all punishments of the Torah.</b> Since the punishment of <i>karet</i> for eating leavened bread on Passover is included in this general principle, there is no need for a separate source to include women.",
    "The Gemara answers: Nonetheless, it is <b>necessary</b> to cite a source that men and women are equal specifically with regard to the punishment of <i>karet</i> for eating leavened bread,"
