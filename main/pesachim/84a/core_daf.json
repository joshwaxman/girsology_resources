    "<b>but not a circumcision</b> that is <b>not at its</b> ideal <b>time</b>. If, for some reason, circumcision was not performed on the eighth day after birth, its performance at a later date does not override a Festival, because the obligation to perform the circumcision is not particular to that specific day. This needed to be emphasized. Otherwise, it would have <b>come</b> to be derived <b>through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that circumcision does override Shabbat and Festivals, based on the fact that it overrides the laws of leprosy. Therefore, the Torah emphasized that circumcision performed later than the eighth day does not override Festivals.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different reason that the leftover Paschal lamb is not burned on the Festival: The obligation of <b>solemn rest</b> stated <b>with regard to Festivals is a positive</b> mitzva. Therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of Festivals include both a positive mitzva to rest from performing prohibited labor and a prohibition to avoid such labor, <b>and a positive</b> mitzva such as burning leftover sacrificial meat <b>does not override</b> both <b>a prohibition and a positive</b> mitzva.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Anything that is</b> fit to be <b>eaten in an adult ox,</b> whose bones have fully hardened, may <b>be eaten in a young kid.</b> One may register for a Paschal offering in order to eat any of these parts, and eating any such part is considered a fulfillment of the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb. However, any part of the animal that is inedible in an adult ox is not considered meat, even if it is soft enough to be eaten in a young kid. One may not register for a Paschal offering in order to eat one of these parts, and eating it is not a fulfillment of the mitzva to eat the Paschal lamb. <b>And</b> the soft <b>ends of the ribs and the cartilage</b> are soft enough to be considered edible and may therefore be eaten from the Paschal lamb.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba raised a contradiction: We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>anything that is</b> fit to be <b>eaten in an adult ox may be eaten in a young kid,</b> which indicates clearly that anything <b>that is not eaten</b> in an adult ox is <b>not</b> eaten even when it comes from a young kid. <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>The ends of the ribs and the cartilage</b> of the young kid may be eaten. <b>But these are not eaten in an adult ox,</b> because they have already become as hard as bone and are no longer edible.",
    "<b>Rather, it is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> and both opinions are mentioned in the mishna, <b>and this is what it is teaching: Anything eaten in an adult ox may be eaten in a young kid, and</b> anything <b>that is not eaten</b> in an adult ox is <b>not</b> eaten in a young kid. <b>And some say</b> that <b>even the ends of the ribs and the cartilage</b> are eaten from a young kid, because even these parts of an adult ox can be made edible through extensive cooking.",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> The mishna <b>teaches</b> employing the style: <b>What are they,</b> in which the mishna establishes a principle and then provides detail, <b>and this is what it is teaching: Anything that is</b> fit to be <b>eaten in an adult ox through cooking may be eaten in a young kid through roasting,</b> even if this part of an adult ox cannot be made edible through roasting. <b>And what are these</b> parts? They are <b>the ends of the ribs and the cartilage.</b>",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava: Anything that is</b> fit to be <b>eaten in an adult ox through cooking may be eaten in a young kid through roasting; and what are these</b> parts? They are <b>the ends of the ribs and the cartilage; and the soft sinews are judged as meat.</b>",
    "<b>It was stated</b> that the Sages disputed the issue of <b>sinews that will eventually harden</b> but are currently soft. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may register for them in the Paschal lamb. Reish Lakish said: One may not register for them in the Paschal lamb.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>one may register for them</b> in the Paschal lamb because <b>we follow the current</b> condition of the sinews; since they are edible in their current state, they are considered meat. <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that <b>one may not register for them</b> in the Paschal lamb because <b>we follow the eventual</b> condition of the sinews, and they eventually become inedible.",
    "<b>Reish Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> It was stated that <b>anything eaten in an adult ox may be eaten in a young kid, and what are these</b> parts? They are <b>the ends of the ribs and the cartilage.</b> This indicates that with regard to <b>these</b> items, <b>yes,</b> they may be eaten; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>sinews that will eventually harden, no,</b> they may not. This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: It taught these,</b> the ends of the ribs and the cartilage, <b>and the same is true for those,</b> i.e., the same <i>halakha</i> applies to sinews that will eventually harden. <b>What is the reason</b> that people may register for <b>these,</b> the ends of the ribs and the cartilage? It is <b>because they are eaten in an adult ox through cooking. These, too,</b> the sinews that will eventually harden, <b>are eaten in an adult ox through cooking.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Avin: When you go before Rabbi Abbahu, raise</b> the following <b>contradiction to him: Did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say:</b> With regard to <b>sinews that will eventually harden,</b> people <b>may register for them in the Paschal lamb,</b> which would <b>apparently</b> indicate that <b>we go</b> according to <b>the current</b> condition of the sinews? <b>But Reish Lakish asked Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>the hide of the head of a young calf,</b> which is still edible, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility of it <b>becoming ritually impure</b> as a food? Do we view it as a food and apply the rules of ritual impurity of foods, or do we view it as a hide? <b>And he said to him: It does not become ritually impure. Apparently, we go</b> according to <b>the eventual</b> condition of the hide, which contradicts Rabbi Yoḥanan’s own opinion with regard to sinews.",
    "When Rabbi Avin came before Rabbi Abbahu and asked him this question, Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him:</b> Whoever <b>asked you this</b> question <b>was not concerned for his flour,</b> meaning he did not carefully consider what he said. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan retracted</b> his opinion in this regard in favor of the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him,</b> at the end of their discussion on the topic: <b>Do not trouble me</b> by asking a question based on a mishna that seems to prove that we follow the current state of the hide, <b>as I teach it in the singular.</b> That mishna, on which I previously relied, is the opinion of one Sage and should not be relied upon. This proves that Rabbi Yoḥanan changed his mind and concluded that the status of parts of the animal is established based on their eventual condition. The opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan with regard to the Paschal lamb was stated before he changed his mind.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who breaks the bone of a Paschal lamb that is ritually pure receives forty lashes</b> for having violated a prohibition stated in the Torah. <b>But one who leaves over</b> part <b>of a ritually pure</b> Paschal lamb <b>and one who breaks</b> the bone <b>of a ritually impure</b> Paschal lamb <b>do not receive forty lashes.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the mishna’s rulings: <b>Granted, one who leaves over</b> part <b>of a ritually pure</b> Paschal lamb is not flogged for having violated Torah law. There is good reason for this, <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall not leave any of it until morning; and that which remains of it until morning</b> you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to provide a positive</b> mitzva to burn the leftover <b>after the prohibition</b> against leaving it over, <b>to say that one is not flogged</b> because any prohibition that can be rectified by the performance of a positive mitzva does not carry a punishment of lashes. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: This is not for</b> that <b>reason. Rather,</b> it is <b>because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> The transgression is simply the failure to consume all the meat during the allotted time rather than the performance of an action. <b>And one is not flogged for</b> any prohibition that does not involve an action<b>. But</b> with regard to <b>one who breaks</b> the bone <b>of a ritually impure</b> Paschal lamb, <b>from where do we</b> derive that he, too, does not receive lashes? The Gemara answers that the source is <b>as the verse states:</b> “In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not remove any of the meat from the house to the outside, <b>and you shall not break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). It may be inferred that the prohibition applies <b>“in it,” in a valid</b> Paschal lamb, <b>and not in a disqualified</b> one.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to that same topic: <b>“And you shall not break a bone in it”;</b> the prohibition applies <b>in it,</b> i.e., <b>in a valid</b> Paschal lamb <b>and not in a disqualified</b> one. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> should be learned in the following manner: It states: <b>“In one house shall it be eaten,”</b> and shortly thereafter the verse states: <b>“And you shall not break a bone in it,”</b> from which one can derive that <b>any</b> Paschal lamb <b>fit for eating is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone, and</b> any Paschal lamb <b>that is not fit for eating is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking a bone</b>.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between them? Rabbi Yirmeya said: The practical difference between them is</b> with regard to <b>a Paschal lamb that is brought</b> when the majority of the nation is <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> According <b>to the one who says</b> that the prohibition of breaking a bone applies only to <b>a valid</b> Paschal lamb,"
