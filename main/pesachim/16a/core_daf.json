    "If there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether or not a certain <b>liquid has become ritually impure,</b> it is presumed <b>impure.</b> It is an uncertainty with regard to Torah law, and the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in such cases. However, if the uncertainty is with regard <b>to rendering other</b> items <b>impure,</b> they are <b>pure,</b> as liquids transmit impurity by rabbinic law, and the <i>halakha</i> is lenient with regard to uncertainties of that kind. These are <b>the statements of Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Elazar would say likewise in accordance with his statements. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> When there is uncertainty with regard to these liquids, the item is <b>impure in all</b> cases, even in terms of transmitting impurity to other items, as he maintains that the impurity of liquids is by Torah law.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> In cases of uncertainty as to whether or not these liquids transmitted impurity <b>to foods,</b> the ruling is that the foods are <b>impure,</b> in accordance with the principle that when there is uncertainty in cases of Torah law, the <i>halakha</i> is stringent. Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon maintain that liquids transmit impurity to food by Torah law. However, when there is uncertainty as to whether or not these liquids transmitted impurity <b>to vessels,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is lenient, and they are <b>pure.</b> Even Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon concede that liquids transmit impurity to vessels only by rabbinic law. This <i>baraita</i> clearly indicates that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yosei indeed dispute whether or not the impurity of liquids applies by Torah law.",
    "With regard to the <i>Tosefta</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>Rabbi Elazar maintain</b> that <b>liquids have ritual impurity</b> by Torah law <b>at all? Wasn’t</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: There is no impurity for liquids at all</b> by Torah law. <b>Know</b> that this is so, <b>as Yosei ben Yo’ezer of Tzereida testified about</b> the grasshopper called <b><i>eil kamtza</i></b> that it is <b>kosher</b> and may be eaten; <b>and</b> he testified <b>about liquids</b> in <b>the slaughterhouse</b> in the Temple that they were <b>ritually pure,</b> as there was no decree of impurity issued with regard to them. The fact that these liquids are ritually pure indicates that by Torah law liquids cannot transmit impurity at all. Instead, that type of impurity is by rabbinic law, and rabbinic decrees of impurity were not in effect in the Temple.",
    "The Gemara adds: <b>This</b> works out <b>well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who said</b> that in this context the term <b>ritually pure</b> means that they do not <b>transmit impurity to other</b> items; <b>however, they themselves</b> can <b>become impure.</b> If that is Rabbi Elazar’s opinion, he indeed holds in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Meir that liquids transmit impurity by rabbinic law but themselves become impure by Torah law, as stated in the <i>baraita</i> above. <b>However, according to Rav, who said that</b> Yosei ben Yo’ezer holds that the liquids are <b>actually ritually pure</b> and they themselves cannot be rendered impure, <b>what can be said?</b> According to Rav, Rabbi Elazar maintains that there is no impurity at all by Torah law with regard to liquids. In what sense does he hold in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who said that liquids themselves can become impure by Torah law?",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> When the <i>baraita</i> said that Rabbi Elazar agreed with Rabbi Meir, it was <b>with regard to one</b> of Rabbi Meir’s opinions. Rabbi Elazar agrees with Rabbi Meir that in a case where there is uncertainty with regard to rendering other items impure, they are pure, as liquids transmit impurity by rabbinic law. However, Rabbi Elazar maintains that the impurity of liquids themselves is also not by Torah law, and therefore in a case of uncertainty with regard to impurity of the liquids themselves, the ruling is that they are pure.",
    "The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying:</b> And Rabbi Elazar would say <b>in accordance with</b> Rabbi Meir’s <b>statements,</b> in the plural, indicating <b>that</b> the points of agreement are <b>many? And furthermore,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching: Likewise.</b> This term also indicates that Rabbi Elazar agrees completely with Rabbi Meir. Since no resolution was found for this contradiction, the Gemara concludes that it is indeed <b>difficult</b> to understand the <i>baraita</i> according to Rav.",
    "After citing the testimony of Yosei ben Yo’ezer and the associated amoraic dispute, the Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav said:</b> Yosei ben Yo’ezer said that the liquids in the Temple are <b>actually ritually pure</b> and neither become impure nor transmit impurity. <b>And Shmuel said</b> that the liquids are <b>ritually pure</b> in the sense that they do not <b>transmit impurity to other</b> items; <b>however, they themselves</b> can <b>become impure.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav said</b> that liquids are <b>actually pure,</b> as <b>he maintains</b> that <b>the ritual impurity of liquids</b> is <b>by rabbinic law, and when the Sages issued</b> this <b>decree</b> they did so only with regard <b>to ordinary liquids.</b> However, with regard <b>to the liquids of the slaughterhouse</b> in the Temple, <b>they did not issue</b> the <b>decree.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara elaborates on the opinion of Shmuel: <b>Shmuel said</b> that the liquids are <b>ritually pure</b> in the sense that they do not <b>transmit impurity to other</b> items; <b>however, they themselves</b> can <b>become impure,</b> as Shmuel <b>maintains</b> that the <b>ritual impurity of liquids</b> themselves is <b>by Torah law,</b> whereas their capacity <b>to transmit impurity to other</b> objects is <b>by rabbinic law. And when the Sages issued</b> this <b>decree,</b> they did so only with regard <b>to ordinary liquids.</b> However, with regard <b>to the liquids of the slaughterhouse</b> in the Temple <b>they did not issue</b> the <b>decree. And when</b> Shmuel said that <b>the Sages did not issue</b> their <b>decree</b> with regard to the liquids of the slaughterhouse, he meant that they did not do so with regard to their capacity <b>to transmit impurity to other</b> items; <b>however,</b> as far as <b>their own impurity</b> is concerned, <b>they become</b> impure like other liquids.",
    "<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said to his son: When you enter before Rav Pappa, raise</b> the following <b>contradiction before him: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that the liquids are <b>ritually pure</b> in the sense that they do not <b>transmit impurity to other</b> items <b>but they themselves are</b> susceptible to <b>impurity?</b> Is there anything that by Torah law can itself become impure but does not transmit impurity to other items? <b>Read here</b> a verse that clearly states that any item that is itself impure, including liquids, transmits impurity to other items: <b>“And the flesh that touches anything impure shall not be eaten;</b> it shall be burnt in fire” (Leviticus 7:19).",
    "<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The legal status of liquids is <b>just as it is</b> in the case <b>of fourth-</b>degree ritual impurity <b>in a consecrated</b> item, with regard to which everyone agrees that it becomes impure but does not transmit impurity to other items. <b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this</b> contention: How is it possible to compare these two cases? <b>Fourth-</b>degree impurity <b>in</b> a <b>consecrated</b> item <b>is not called impure;</b> it is disqualified. However, <b>this</b> liquid <b>is called impure.</b> Therefore, the two <i>halakhot</i> are not comparable. No resolution is found for this contradiction, and the Gemara concludes that it is indeed <b>difficult.</b>",
    "The Gemara cites several sources to decide the dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> and between Rav and Shmuel with regard to whether or not the impurity of liquids is by Torah law. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “And all drink that may be drunk in any vessel shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 11:34). This verse clearly indicates that liquids can become impure. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>Shall be impure,</b> in this context? It means that the liquid <b>renders</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.",
    "The Gemara retorts: Does it in fact mean that the liquid <b>renders</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? That cannot be as <b>you</b> already <b>learned</b> that <b>from the beginning of</b> this <b>verse: “From all food that may be eaten,</b> on which water has come shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, the second part of the verse is also necessary: <b>One</b> part of the verse, the latter part, is referring <b>to</b> water <b>detached</b> from its source, in vessels, <b>and one</b> part, the former part, is referring <b>to</b> water still <b>attached</b> to its source in the ground.",
    "<b>And</b> both derivations <b>are necessary,</b> as neither <i>halakha</i> could have been derived from the other. <b>As, had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only about the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> water <b>detached</b> from its source, one might have thought that this water renders food susceptible to ritual impurity <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he ascribed significance to</b> the water by drawing it from its source. <b>However,</b> with regard to water still <b>attached</b> to its source, say that it does <b>not</b> render food susceptible to ritual impurity.",
    "<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught</b> only the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> water still <b>attached</b> to its source, one might have thought that <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it stands in its place</b> this water <b>is significant; however,</b> with regard to water <b>detached</b> from its source, <b>say no,</b> it does <b>not</b> render food susceptible to ritual impurity, as it is disconnected from its source. It was therefore <b>necessary</b> for the Torah to mention both cases.",
    "The Gemara cites another proof. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “However, a spring or a cistern, a gathering of water shall be pure,</b> but he who touches their carcass shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:36). It can be inferred from this verse that all water can be rendered impure, with the exception of spring water and water in a cistern, which are in the ground. The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>What is</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Shall be pure”?</b> This phrase means that one who immerses in this water is purified <b>from his ritual impurity,</b> and does not refer to the impurity of liquids at all.",
    "The Gemara stated that both water detached from its source and water still <b>attached</b> to its source render food susceptible to ritual impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> water <b>detached</b> from its source <b>render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to contract impurity? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, say:</b> With regard to the <b>liquids of the slaughterhouse</b> in the Temple, <b>not only are they pure,</b> but <b>neither do they render</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? Apparently, water detached from its source does not render food susceptible to impurity by Torah law. The fact that the Sages suspend the capacity of certain liquids to render produce susceptible to impurity indicates that the fact that water removed from its source renders food susceptible to impurity must be by rabbinic decree. Otherwise, that capability could not have been suspended in the Temple.",
    "The Gemara rejects this contention: <b>Explain this</b> statement as referring <b>to blood.</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina was not referring to all liquids in the Temple, but only to blood. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to blood of consecrated</b> offerings <b>that it does not render</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to impurity? <b>As it is stated:</b> “You shall surely not eat the blood; <b>you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:16). The Sages derived from this verse: <b>Blood that is poured like water,</b> i.e., blood from a non-sacred domesticated animal that pours out when it is slaughtered and is not received in a vessel as sacrificial blood assumes the legal status of water and <b>renders</b> produce <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity."
