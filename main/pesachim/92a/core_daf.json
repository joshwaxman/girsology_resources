    "<b>And one who gathers</b> the <b>bones</b> of his parents, who are buried in a temporary location for their flesh to decay and who is moving them to a permanent burial place must also observe a day of acute mourning by rabbinic decree. These mourners <b>immerse and eat</b> all types of <b>sacrificial food</b> at night. Since in these cases, even during the day, the mourning is by rabbinic decree, the Sages did not extend it into the evening.",
    "With regard to <b>a convert who converted on Passover eve, Beit Shammai say: He immerses and eats his Paschal lamb in the evening. And Beit Hillel say: One who separates from the foreskin</b> by being circumcised is ritually impure, <b>like one who separates from the grave</b> after coming in contact with a corpse. Consequently, he must first observe the seven-day purification process necessary to remove ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. Only then, from the eighth day onward, may he partake of sacrificial meat.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that an acute mourner may eat the Paschal lamb in the evening? The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that the observance of <b>acute mourning at night</b> after the day of one’s relative’s death <b>is a rabbinic</b> prohibition. <b>And with regard to the Paschal lamb,</b> the Sages waived their prohibition because <b>they did not uphold their statement</b> prohibiting consumption of sacrificial food <b>in a situation</b> in which doing so would violate a prohibition that carries the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i>,</b> as is the case with one who neglects to offer the Paschal lamb. On the other hand, <b>with regard to</b> other <b>sacrificial food,</b> they maintained the prohibition, because <b>they upheld their statement in a situation</b> in which neglecting to eat the sacrificial food entails only the neglect of <b>a positive mitzva.</b>",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>One who hears about</b> the death of <b>his dead</b> relative more than thirty days after the death and one who gathers bones immerse and eat sacrificial food in the evening. The Gemara expresses surprise: Can this apply to <b>one who gathers bones? But</b> by doing so he came in contact with the bones of a corpse, and <b>he needs sprinkling on</b> the <b>third and seventh</b> days in order to become ritually pure. The Gemara answers: Emend the teaching of the mishna and instead <b>say:</b> One <b>for whom they gathered bones,</b> meaning that other people gathered the bones of his parents to transfer them to a new grave but he himself did not touch them, has a rabbinical requirement to observe a day of acute mourning, but he is not ritually impure.",
    "We learned in the mishna: With regard to <b>a convert who converted</b> on Passover eve, there is a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel as to whether he may immerse and eat the Paschal sacrifice in the evening. The Gemara discusses the scope of this dispute: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>the dispute is about an uncircumcised gentile</b> that was circumcised and converted on Passover eve.",
    "<b>Beit Hillel hold</b> that <b>there is a rabbinic decree</b> due to a concern that <b>perhaps he will become contaminated</b> by a corpse <b>in the following year and he will say: Last year,</b> even though I had come in contact with a corpse previous to Passover, <b>did I not immerse and eat</b> the Paschal lamb without completing the purification process for impurity imparted by a corpse? <b>Now also, I will immerse and eat. And he does not know</b> and understand <b>that last year,</b> before his conversion on Passover eve, <b>he was a gentile and</b> therefore <b>he was not susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> because gentiles do not contract ritual impurity according to Torah law, but <b>now he is a Jew and is susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> Therefore, the Sages decreed that he should complete the seven-day purification process for impurity imparted by a corpse before he can partake of sacrificial food in order to avoid such a mistake.",
    "<b>And Beit Shammai hold that we do not make a decree</b> due to this concern. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>an uncircumcised Jew</b> who for some reason had not been circumcised until Passover eve, <b>all agree that he may immerse and eat his Paschal lamb in the evening.</b> The concern that he will err the following year does not apply, <b>and we do not decree</b> in the case of an <b>uncircumcised Jew</b> who was circumcised on Passover eve, <b>due to</b> concern that the case will be confused with that of <b>an uncircumcised gentile</b> who was circumcised and converted on Passover eve.",
    "<b>That was also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree about</b> the fact that <b>an uncircumcised Jew</b> who was circumcised on Passover eve <b>may immerse and eat his Paschal lamb in the evening. With regard to what did they disagree? With regard to an uncircumcised gentile</b> who converted on Passover eve. <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>he may immerse and eat his Paschal lamb in the evening, and Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>one who separates from the foreskin is</b> ritually impure <b>like one who separates from the grave.</b>",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>an uncircumcised</b> gentile who converted, <b>sprinkling</b> the purification waters to purify impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>and</b> a circumcision <b>scalpel [<i>izmel</i>],</b> the Sages <b>upheld their statement</b> even <b>in a situation</b> in which doing so would violate a prohibition that carries the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i>.</b> However, with regard to <b>an acute mourner, a leper, and a <i>beit haperas</i>,</b> an area in which a doubt exists concerning the location of a grave or a corpse, <b>they did not uphold their statement in a situation</b> in which doing so would violate a prohibition that carries the punishment <b>of <i>karet</i>.</b>",
    "The Gemara details all the cases Rava referred to: The case of <b>an uncircumcised</b> gentile who converted is <b>as we have said</b> previously. Beit Hillel disqualify a convert from offering the Paschal lamb, despite the fact that neglecting to do so renders one liable to receive <i>karet</i>.",
    "The case of <b>sprinkling</b> the purification waters to purify impurity imparted by a corpse is <b>as the Master said</b> in a mishna: <b>Sprinkling</b> is prohibited on Shabbat due to <b>rabbinic decree, and it does not override Shabbat</b> even on Passover eve, despite the fact that one who requires sprinkling will then be unable to offer the Paschal lamb.",
    "The case of the circumcision <b>scalpel</b> is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a circumcision scalpel was not brought to the location of the baby from before Shabbat, <b>just as we may not bring it through a public domain</b> in violation of Torah law, <b>so</b> too <b>we may not bring it through roofs, through courtyards, and through enclosures,</b> even though carrying in this manner is prohibited by rabbinic decree. One who has an uncircumcised member of his household may not bring a Paschal lamb and is liable for <i>karet</i>. The Sages maintained the prohibition of carrying the scalpel in all circumstances, even when doing so would mean the baby would remain uncircumcised on Passover eve, preventing his household from offering a Paschal lamb.",
    "The Gemara lists the cases where the Sages waived their prohibition in the face of a prohibition carrying the punishment of <i>karet</i>: The case of an <b>acute mourner is that which we said</b> in the mishna.",
    "The case of the <b>leper, what is it?</b> It is <b>as it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A leper</b> is ritually impure and must undergo an involved, eight-day purification process, which culminates on the eighth day with the bringing of various offerings in the Temple. If his <b>eighth day occurs on Passover eve,</b> such that it would be possible to bring his offerings and be fit to partake of the Paschal lamb that evening, <b>and he saw an occurrence</b> of semen <b>on that day,</b> and one who experiences such a discharge is ritually impure and prohibited from entering the Temple, <b>he may immerse</b> in order to purify himself from the discharge and then bring his offerings <b>and eat</b> the Paschal lamb at night.",
    "<b>The Sages said: Although</b> normally, with regard to ritual impurity from seminal discharge, <b>one who has immersed on that day may not enter</b> the Temple until nightfall, <b>this one may enter.</b> The reason is that <b>it is better for a positive mitzva that has</b> a punishment of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., the bringing of the Paschal lamb, <b>to come and override a positive mitzva that does not have</b> a punishment of <b><i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., the mitzva of “They shall send out from the camp every leper and whoever has had issue, and whoever is unclean by the dead” (Numbers 5:2), which requires the removal from the Temple of one who has immersed that day and will become pure only upon nightfall.",
    "<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: By Torah law, there is not even a positive mitzva</b> that restricts one who has immersed that day and will become pure only upon nightfall from entering the Temple, <b>as it is stated: “And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judea and Jerusalem, in the House of the Lord, before the new courtyard”</b> (II Chronicles 20:5). <b>What</b> is indicated by identifying the courtyards as <b>the new courtyard?</b> It indicates <b>that they innovated something in it, and they said: One who has immersed on that day</b> but will become pure only upon nightfall <b>may not enter the Levite camp,</b> which includes the entire Temple Mount. This suggests that the prohibition is of rabbinic origin and is not a positive mitzva.",
    "The case of a <b><i>beit haperas</i>,</b> in which the Sages did not uphold their decree, is <b>as it was taught</b> in a mishna: <b>And Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel agree</b>"
