    "<b>because the light of a lamp is effective for searching. And even though there is no proof for</b> this <b>matter, there is an allusion to</b> this <b>matter, as it is stated: “Seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses”</b> (Exodus 12:19), <b>and it says: “And he searched, starting with the eldest,</b> and ending with the youngest; and the goblet was found in Benjamin’s sack…” (Genesis 44:12). <b>And it says: “At that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps”</b> (Zephaniah 1:12), <b>and it says: “The spirit of man is the lamp of God, searching all the inward parts”</b> (Proverbs 20:27).",
    "The Gemara asks a question: <b>This light of the sun,</b> by which one may not conduct the search for leaven, <b>what are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to conducting a search <b>in the courtyard, didn’t Rava say</b> that <b>a courtyard does not require searching, due to the ravens</b> and other birds <b>that are found there,</b> and will certainly eat any leaven there? <b>Rather,</b> perhaps this ruling is referring <b>to a portico,</b> which is not frequented by ravens. However, this cannot be the correct interpretation either, as <b>didn’t Rava say</b> with regard to that case that <b>a portico may be searched by its</b> own <b>light,</b> i.e., one need not use a lamp at all when searching a portico, but one may search it by sunlight?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this statement with regard to sunlight <b>is necessary with regard to the skylight that is in a room.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to the area to <b>which</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring, <b>where</b> in the room is it located? <b>If</b> he is referring to the place <b>opposite the skylight,</b> the legal status of <b>that</b> area is like that of <b>a portico,</b> as its abundant sunlight is adequate to search for leaven. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring <b>to the sides</b> of the room. In those areas, one cannot rely on the sunlight from the skylight. He must search by the light of the lamp.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is the light of <b>a torch not</b> bright enough for searching? <b>But didn’t Rava say: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written, “And a brightness appears as the light; He has rays at His side; and there is the hiding of His power”</b> (Habakkuk 3:4), which indicates that God will provide rays of glory for the righteous in the future? The Sages explained this verse by means of a parable: <b>To what are the righteous comparable before the Divine Presence?</b> They are comparable <b>to a lamp in the face of a torch.</b> This statement indicates that the light of a torch is significantly greater than that of a lamp, and consequently a torch should be more effective in the search for leaven. <b>And</b> likewise <b>Rava said:</b> One who uses <b>a torch for</b> the blessing over fire in <b><i>havdala</i></b> has performed <b>the mitzva</b> in <b>the optimal manner.</b> Apparently, the light of a torch is greater than that of a lamp.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not prohibit the use of a torch due to its failure to provide sufficient light. Rather, it is due to the fact that one <b>can put this</b> lamp <b>into holes and crevices,</b> as it is a small flame, <b>and</b> one <b>cannot put that</b> torch <b>into holes and crevices,</b> as it is a large flame.<br><b>Rav Zevid said: This</b> lamp projects <b>its light before it,</b> facilitating the search, <b>and that</b> torch projects <b>its light behind it,</b> on the person conducting the search.<br><b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The reason is that when using <b>this</b> torch one <b>fears</b> starting a fire, <b>and</b> when using <b>that</b> lamp he does <b>not fear</b> starting a fire.<br><b>Ravina said: This</b> lamp consistently <b>draws light, and</b> the light of <b>that</b> torch <b>fluctuates.</b> Although overall the torch provides greater light than a lamp, it is less effective for use in a search.",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>Any place into which one does not</b> typically <b>take</b> leaven does not require searching. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the inclusive phrase: <b>Any place,</b> come <b>to include?</b> The Gemara answers that it comes <b>to include that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The upper and lower holes</b> in the wall of a house that are difficult to use, as well as <b>a veranda roof, a closet roof, a cowshed,</b> chicken <b>coops, a storehouse for straw, a wine cellar, and a storeroom for oil;</b> all these <b>do not require</b> that a <b>search</b> be conducted. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A bed that divides</b> the area <b>inside a house and</b> space <b>separates</b> the bottom of the bed from the floor <b>requires a search,</b> as there might be leaven beneath it.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this <i>baraita</i> and another: With regard to <b>a hole</b> in a wall <b>that is between</b> a house belonging to one <b>person</b> and a house belonging <b>to another, this</b> neighbor <b>searches to the point that his hand reaches, and that</b> neighbor <b>searches to the point that his hand reaches. And</b> as for leaven found in <b>the rest</b> of the hole, each one <b>renders it null and void in his heart. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A bed that divides</b> the area <b>inside a house, with wood and stones placed under it, and</b> space <b>separates</b> the bottom of the bed from the wood and stones beneath it, <b>does not require searching.</b>",
    "This is <b>difficult</b> due to a contradiction between the ruling with regard to <b>a bed</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, where Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that it requires a search, and the ruling with regard to <b>a bed</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, where he rules that no search is required. Furthermore, it is similarly <b>difficult</b> due to a contradiction between the ruling with regard to <b>holes</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, that a search is not required, and the ruling with regard to <b>holes</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that a search is required.",
    "The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between the first ruling with regard to <b>holes</b> and the second ruling with regard to <b>holes</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that one need not search them, is referring <b>to upper and lower</b> holes, which are difficult to use. <b>And that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that one is required to search them, is referring <b>to intermediate</b> holes, whose use is convenient. The apparent contradiction between the first ruling with regard to <b>a bed</b> and the second ruling with regard to <b>a bed is</b> similarly <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that one is required to search them, is referring <b>to a</b> bed that is <b>raised</b> off the floor, and <b>that</b> ruling, that one need not search them, is referring <b>to a</b> bed that is <b>low</b> and the space beneath it cannot be used, and presumably, there is no leaven there.",
    "With regard to this <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>And do wine storages not require searching? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Wine storages require searching; oil storages do not require searching.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where one supplies</b> wine from the storage during the meal. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> then in the case of <b>oil</b> storages, if one supplies oil from the storage during the meal, he should be obligated to search there <b>as well.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>oil, there is a fixed</b> quantity used <b>for eating</b> a meal. A person knows how much oil he will require before the meal begins, and he will therefore supply himself with any oil that he will need before the meal, and no leaven will enter the storage. However, with regard to <b>wine, there is no fixed</b> quantity used <b>for drinking,</b> as one does not know how much wine he will drink during the meal. Consequently, it is possible that he will descend to his wine cellar with bread in his hand to replenish his supply of wine.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> The Sages <b>rendered</b> the legal status of the <b>beer storages in Babylonia like</b> that of <b>wine storages in Eretz Yisrael,</b> with regard <b>to one who supplies</b> wine from the storage during the meal. Any storage from which one replenishes his supply during the meal requires searching for leaven.",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: A fish storage does not require searching.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that a fish storage <b>requires searching?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> lenient ruling is referring <b>to large</b> fish, and <b>that</b> stringent ruling deals <b>with small</b> fish. Since one does not know exactly how many small fish he will require for the meal, he might need to replenish his supply during his meal.",
    "<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: A salt storage and a storage for candles require searching</b> for leaven, as one might have entered those storages during a meal. <b>Rav Pappa</b> likewise <b>said: A wood storage and a storage for dates require searching</b> for the same reason.",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i>: The Sages <b>do not require one to place his hand into holes and crevices to search</b> for leaven, <b>due to the danger</b> involved. The Gemara asks: Due to <b>what danger? If we say</b> it is <b>due to the danger of a scorpion</b> that might be in this hole, <b>when he made use of</b> the hole in the first place, <b>how did he make use</b> of it if there were scorpions there? If the hole is never used, there is no need to search it in any case. The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is necessary</b> to search this hole in a case <b>where</b> leaven <b>fell</b> into it unintentionally.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to a case where leaven <b>fell</b> into the hole, again, <b>why do I</b> need to conduct a <b>search? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna with regard to <b>leaven upon which a rockslide fell, it is considered removed</b> from the owner’s possession? Here too, any leaven that fell into the hole should be considered removed. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> where the <i>tanna</i> said it is as though it were removed, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> the rockslide buries the leaven so that even <b>a dog cannot search for it. Here,</b> it is referring a hole that is not so deep, and therefore <b>a dog can search for it</b> and extract the leaven from the hole.",
    "The Gemara questions the <i>halakha</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> from a different angle. Why is there any concern about danger in this case? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: Those on the path to perform a mitzva are not</b> susceptible to <b>harm</b> throughout the process of performing the mitzva? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Here we are concerned <b>lest he will</b> also <b>have lost a needle</b> in the same place, <b>and he will look for it</b> while he is searching for the leaven. Since he is not merely searching for leaven, the merit of the mitzva will not protect him.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And in a case like that,</b> where there is personal interest intermingled with the performance of a mitzva, is <b>it not</b> nevertheless considered <b>a mitzva? But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who says:</b> I am contributing <b>this <i>sela</i> to charity so that my son will live, or</b> if he says: I am performing the mitzva so that <b>I will be one</b> destined for <b>the World-to-Come,</b>"
