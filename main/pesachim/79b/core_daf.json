    "<b>and those who are impure do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>or the second. They do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>because they are not the majority,</b> and the Paschal lamb may be sacrificed in a state of impurity only when the majority of the community is impure. Additionally, <b>they may not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>because they are not the minority,</b> and only the sacrifice of a minority of the community is deferred to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.",
    "The Gemara raises an objection from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>the entire community became ritually impure, or</b> if <b>most of it</b> became impure, <b>or</b> if <b>the priests were impure and the community</b> was <b>pure, they</b> should <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in impurity.</b> This indicates that it is only when <b>most of</b> the community is impure <b>that they perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in impurity, but</b> if it is <b>half and half, they do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>. This poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav.</b>",
    "<b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> When <b>a majority</b> of the community is impure, <b>they</b> may <b>all perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in impurity.</b> Even those who are still pure are not required to ensure that they remain pure in order to sacrifice the Paschal lamb. When it is <b>half and half, these</b> who are pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of purity <b>and these</b> who are impure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of impurity.",
    "The Gemara adds: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the mishna in this way, <b>as the latter clause teaches:</b> If <b>a minority of the community became impure, those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>and those who are impure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>. This indicates that it is only when <b>the minority</b> has become impure <b>that they perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>. <b>But</b> when it is <b>half and half</b> this is <b>not</b> the case; rather, <b>these perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of purity <b>and those perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of impurity on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>.",
    "<b>However,</b> if so, <b>it then</b> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Kahana</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the latter clause of the mishna should be understood as follows: If <b>a minority of the community became ritually impure, those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>and those who are impure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>. This indicates that if it is <b>half and half, those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>and those who are impure do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first or the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.",
    "The Gemara asks: This works out <b>well according to the latter version</b> of Rav Kahana’s statement, according to which this is the <i>halakha</i> when exactly half of the community is pure and half is impure. <b>But according to that</b> first <b>version,</b> in <b>which Rav Kahana said</b> that when half the community is pure and half is impure, <b>those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>and those who are impure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>what is there to say?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Kahana</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the mishna should be understood as follows: <b>The same is true even</b> in a case of <b>half and half as well; those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>and those who are impure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>. <b>And that which was taught</b> in the mishna that the sacrifice of <b>a minority of the community</b> is deferred to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> is not meant to indicate that half the community cannot observe the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. Rather, <b>since it taught in the first clause</b> of the mishna the case in which <b>the majority of</b> the community became ritually impure, <b>it also taught in the latter clause</b> the case in which <b>the minority of</b> the community became impure, so as to employ a parallel formulation.",
    "The Gemara points out that <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> and <b>it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana, in accordance with</b> each of the <b>two versions</b> of his opinion. <b>It was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav:</b> If <b>the Jewish people were</b> divided, and <b>half</b> were <b>pure and half</b> were <b>impure, those</b> who are pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of purity, <b>and those</b> who are impure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> in a state of impurity on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>.",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the first version of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana:</b> If <b>the Jewish people were</b> divided, and <b>half</b> were <b>pure and half</b> were <b>impure, those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>and those who are impure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.",
    "<b>And it was taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the latter version of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana:</b> If <b>the Jewish people were</b> divided, and <b>half</b> were <b>pure and half</b> were <b>impure, those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>and those who are impure do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>or the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>According to Rav and according to the latter version of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana,</b> with regard to <b>that which was taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i> quoted above, that <b>those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>and those who are impure</b> perform the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>how do they reconcile it?</b> The Gemara answers: According to them, the case under discussion is one <b>where the Jewish people</b> are divided, and <b>half</b> are <b>pure and half</b> are <b>impure.</b> However, the majority of the men are pure, <b>and the</b> majority of the <b>women</b> are impure and the women <b>complete the</b> number of <b>impure</b> people necessary to reach half of the community.",
    "<b>And</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the participation of <b>women in the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>is optional.</b> Therefore, <b>remove the women from those who are impure, and the impure become the minority. And the</b> sacrifice of the <b>minority is deferred to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i></b> according to all opinions.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and according to the first version of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana,</b> with regard to <b>that which was taught</b> in the third <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>Those who are pure perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on the <b>first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>and those who are impure do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb on <b>the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>or</b> on <b>the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>how do they reconcile it</b> according to their opinions?",
    "<b>Rav reconciles</b> the <i>baraita</i> by explaining that it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the men of <b>the Jewish people were</b> divided, and <b>half</b> were <b>impure and half</b> were <b>pure, and</b> the <b>women,</b> a majority of whom were pure, <b>added on to</b> the number of those who were <b>pure</b> so that the majority of the community was pure. <b>And</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the participation of <b>women in the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>is obligatory, and</b> their participation <b>in the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>is optional.</b>",
    "Therefore, <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, those who are impure <b>do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>because they are a minority, and a minority</b> of the community that is ritually impure <b>may not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>. <b>And on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>they do not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb because when one <b>removes the women from them,</b> those who were impure <b>are half</b> of the community, <b>and half</b> the community <b>does not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.",
    "<b>And according to</b> the first version of the opinion of <b>Rav Kahana,</b> in <b>which he said that half</b> the community <b>also performs</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>this</b> is how <b>he would reconcile</b> the <i>baraita</i> with his opinion: It is addressing a case <b>where the Jewish people were</b> divided, and <b>half</b> were <b>pure and half</b> were <b>impure.</b> However, the majority of the men were impure, <b>and</b> it is <b>the women</b> who <b>completed</b> the necessary number of <b>the pure</b> so that the division was half and half. <b>And</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the participation of <b>women on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>is obligatory, and</b> their participation <b>on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>is optional.</b>",
    "Therefore, <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>they</b> may <b>not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>because they are half and half, and</b> according to his opinion, <b>half</b> of the community <b>may not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> in a state of impurity. <b>On the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>as well, they may not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb because one must <b>remove the women from</b> the number of those who are pure, and <b>the impure become the majority, and the majority does not perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>on the second</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i>.",
    "The Gemara asks further: <b>And according to Rav Kahana,</b> with regard to <b>that which was taught</b> in the first of the three <i>baraitot</i> above: If <b>the Jewish people were</b> divided, <b>half</b> were <b>pure and half</b> were <b>impure, those</b> who were pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>and those</b> who were impure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>how does he reconcile it? Rav Kahana</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> This matter <b>is</b> subject to a dispute between <b>the <i>tanna’im</i>. There is one who said</b> that in a case of <b>half and half,</b> each half by itself <b>is</b> considered <b>like the majority, and there is one who said</b> that <b>half and half is not like the majority.</b>",
    "The Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> discussed in the <i>baraita</i> cited previously. If <b>the Jewish people</b> were divided, <b>half</b> were <b>pure and half</b> were <b>impure, those</b> who were pure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>and those</b> who were impure <b>perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>for themselves</b> on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. If <b>those who were impure outnumbered those who were pure even</b> by <b>one</b> person, <b>they should perform</b> the ritual of the Paschal lamb <b>in ritual impurity</b> on the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>because a communal offering is not divided.</b> Therefore, the entire community may sacrifice the Paschal lamb in a state of impurity. This includes those who were pure; they do not need to take care to remain pure in order to sacrifice the Paschal lamb.",
    "<b>Rabbi Elazar ben Matya says: The individual cannot tip</b> the balance of the entire <b>public toward ritual impurity, as it is stated:</b>"
