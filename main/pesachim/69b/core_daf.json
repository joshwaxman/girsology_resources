    "<b>And</b> Rabbi Eliezer further maintains with regard to <b>any</b> form of impurity due to which <b>an individual is deferred</b> to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, that if the entire community is afflicted with it, <b>they observe</b> the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> And he accepts yet another principle: <b>Anything that applies to the community applies to an individual, and anything that does not apply to the community does not apply to an individual.</b>",
    "On the basis of these principles, we can say as follows: With regard to <b>lack of circumcision, if the entire community is uncircumcised we say to them: Arise, and circumcise yourselves, and offer the Paschal lamb,</b> and we do not allow them to offer the sacrifice while uncircumcised. Therefore, with regard to <b>an individual as well, we say to him: Arise, and circumcise yourself, and offer the Paschal lamb; and if he does not circumcise</b> himself <b>and offer</b> the Paschal lamb, <b>he is liable to the punishment of <i>karet</i>.</b>",
    "With regard to <b>impurity,</b> however, <b>if the whole community is impure we do not sprinkle</b> the purifying water <b>on them; rather, they offer</b> the Paschal lamb <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> Therefore, <b>an individual, as well, is exempt</b> from sprinkling; and since he is exempt, sprinkling does not override Shabbat. A distinction may be drawn between the two cases: An uncircumcised person must circumcise himself, but a person who is ritually impure need not undergo purification.",
    "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rava:</b> Are these principles really correct? <b>But</b> there is <b>the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, which does not apply to the community and</b> yet <b>it applies to an individual.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>It is different there, as the community</b> already <b>offered</b> the Paschal lamb <b>on the first</b> <i>Pesaḥ</i> in a state of ritual impurity, and therefore the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> can apply to individuals although it does not apply to the community.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> in which it was taught: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that only one who was pure and not on a distant journey is punishable by <i>karet</i></b> for having neglected to offer the Paschal lamb, as the Torah explicitly states that a person who was ritually impure or on a distant journey is exempt from the first <i>Pesaḥ</i> and obligated in the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. But as for one who was <b>uncircumcised or ritually impure from a creeping animal and all the others who are ritually impure</b> not from a corpse, and they did not undergo circumcision or purification before Passover, <b>from where</b> do we know that they are also liable to receive <i>karet</i>? <b>The verse states:</b> “But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, then that person shall be cut off from his people” (Numbers 9:13); the expression <b>“but the man”</b> comes to include anyone who can become pure and fit to participate in the Paschal lamb, but fails to do so.",
    "The Gemara infers from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>From</b> the fact that <b>he searches for</b> a source to include <b>one who is ritually impure from a creeping animal,</b> it is clear that <b>he holds that one may not slaughter</b> the Paschal lamb <b>or sprinkle</b> its blood <b>for someone who is ritually impure from a creeping animal. For if one may slaughter and sprinkle for someone impure from a creeping animal, why did he search for</b> a source to include <b>it? He is</b> the same as anyone who is <b>pure</b> and did not offer the Paschal lamb, for he could have sent his offering with someone else and eaten from it in the evening after having undergone ritual immersion. Rather, it is clear that one may not slaughter or sprinkle for him; and, nonetheless, if he neglected the mitzva of the Paschal lamb, he is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. <b>Apparently</b> then, <b>although he was not fit</b> at that time to offer the Paschal lamb, <b>the obligation is</b> nonetheless <b>incumbent upon him</b> to render himself fit. <b>And although this does not apply to the community,</b> for a community that is impure with the impurity of a creeping animal brings the Paschal lamb in a state of impurity, <b>it does apply to an individual.</b>",
    "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that we should reject the previous statement and say instead that <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds that one may slaughter</b> the Paschal lamb <b>and sprinkle</b> its blood <b>for someone who is ritually impure from a creeping animal, and the same is true with regard to someone who is ritually impure from a corpse on his seventh</b> day of impurity. If so, <b>for what</b> purpose is the <b>sprinkling</b> of the purifying water? If it is possible to slaughter the Paschal lamb and sprinkle its blood on this person’s behalf even when he is impure, the only reason to sprinkle the purifying water is <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>eating</b> the Paschal lamb. However, <b>eating of the Paschal lamb is not essential</b> for the fulfillment of the mitzva, for if the blood of the sacrifice is sprinkled in a permitted fashion on someone’s behalf and afterward he is unable to eat the meat of the sacrifice, e.g., it became impure or was lost, he has fulfilled his obligation and is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>. This being the case, sprinkling the purifying waters is not an act that is necessary to facilitate a mitzva and does not override Shabbat even according to Rabbi Eliezer.",
    "<b>Rav Adda bar Abba said to Rava: If</b> it is <b>so,</b> that one may slaughter the Paschal lamb for someone who is ritually impure from a creeping animal, <b>it turns out that the Paschal lamb is slaughtered for</b> people <b>who cannot eat it,</b> and it is stated elsewhere that such a sacrifice is disqualified. Rava <b>said to him:</b> When it says that a Paschal lamb that is slaughtered <b>for</b> people <b>who cannot eat</b> is disqualified, this refers to a case where it is slaughtered <b>for a sick or elderly person who is not</b> at all <b>fit</b> to eat the sacrifice. <b>But this</b> person is essentially <b>fit</b> to eat the sacrifice but <b>has not</b> yet <b>been made ready</b> to actually eat it. He himself is regarded as fit to eat the sacrifice, and it is only some external factor that prevents him from doing so.",
    "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Akiva stated a principle</b> that any prohibited labor required for the offering of the sacrifice that can be performed before Shabbat does not override Shabbat; whereas slaughter, which cannot be performed on the eve of Shabbat, overrides Shabbat.<b>Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> with regard to the Paschal lamb. The Gemara points out that <b>we also learned</b> something <b>similar to this</b> in another mishna <b>with regard to circumcision: Rabbi Akiva stated a principle: Any prohibited labor</b> required for circumcision <b>that can be performed on the eve of Shabbat</b> because it need not be done specifically on the day of the circumcision <b>does not override Shabbat;</b> the <b>circumcision</b> itself, <b>which cannot be performed on the eve of Shabbat,</b> since it is not yet time to perform the circumcision, <b>overrides Shabbat. And Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> with regard to circumcision.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this ruling in both cases, <b>for had</b> Rav <b>taught us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva only <b>with regard to the Paschal lamb,</b> the conclusion would have been: It is specifically <b>there that the facilitators of a mitzva</b> that can be performed the day before <b>do not override Shabbat because thirteen covenants were not established upon</b> the Paschal lamb, and it is therefore not so significant. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>circumcision, upon which thirteen covenants were established,</b> as is evidenced by the fact that the word covenant appears thirteen times in the chapter relating to circumcision (Genesis 17), which serves as a covenant between God and the Jewish nation, <b>I would say</b> that even facilitating actions that could have been performed on Shabbat eve should <b>override</b> Shabbat.",
    "<b>And had</b> Rav <b>taught us</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva only <b>with regard to circumcision,</b> the conclusion would have been: <b>It is</b> specifically <b>there that the facilitators of a mitzva</b> that can be performed before Shabbat <b>do not override Shabbat, as there is no</b> punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> if the circumcision is delayed, since liability for <i>karet</i> only applies when the child becomes obligated in mitzvot and chooses not to circumcise himself. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the Paschal lamb, where there is <i>karet</i></b> for one who fails to offer the sacrifice at its proper time, <b>I would say that</b> such facilitators <b>should override</b> Shabbat. <b>It is</b> therefore <b>necessary</b> to teach that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva in both cases.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>When does one bring a Festival peace-offering with</b> the Paschal lamb? A special offering is brought on the fourteenth of Nisan together with the Paschal lamb <b>when</b> the Paschal lamb <b>comes on a weekday</b> rather than on Shabbat, and when it comes <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity</b> as opposed to when it is brought in a state of impurity because most of the community is impure, <b>and</b> when many people are registered for the Paschal lamb so that each person will receive only <b>a small</b> portion from it. When these three conditions are met, the Festival peace-offering is eaten first and the Paschal lamb is eaten afterward. <b>When,</b> however, the Paschal lamb <b>comes on Shabbat,</b> or <b>when</b> few people are registered for it so that each person will receive <b>a large</b> portion, or when it is brought <b>in</b> a state of <b>ritual impurity, one does not bring a Festival peace-offering with it.</b>",
    "With regard to the extra offering itself, the <b>Festival peace-offering would come from the flock, from the herd, from sheep or from goats, from males or from females,</b> as the Festival peace-offering is not bound by the limitations governing the Paschal offering, which must be specifically a young male sheep or goat. <b>And</b> the Festival peace-offering <b>is eaten for two days and one night</b> like other peace-offerings.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara questions why this <i>halakha</i> is recorded here: <b>What did</b> the mishna previously <b>teach that</b> made it relevant to <b>teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a Festival peace-offering</b> despite the fact that it seems to be unconnected to the previous <i>mishnayot</i>? The Gemara answers: Since <b>it taught that carrying</b> the Paschal lamb through a public domain <b>and bringing it</b> from outside the Shabbat limit <b>do not override Shabbat, it also taught</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a Festival peace-offering, that it does not override Shabbat. And this is what</b> the mishna <b>is saying: When does one bring a Festival peace-offering with</b> the Paschal lamb? <b>When it comes on a weekday, in</b> a state of <b>ritual purity, and when</b> each person’s portion is <b>small.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said: Learn from this</b> that <b>the Festival peace-offering of the fourteenth</b> of Nisan, which comes with the Paschal lamb and is the subject of our mishna, as opposed to the Festival peace-offering that is brought on the first day of Passover and is called the Festival peace-offering of the fifteenth,"
