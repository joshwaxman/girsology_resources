    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> consider the case of <b>shavings, where the main</b> object of <b>idol worship</b> still <b>exists, and</b> nevertheless <b>it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier that if a gentile shaved an idol down <b>for its</b> own <b>sake,</b> the idol is <b>forbidden, but its shavings are permitted.</b> Here too, in the case of the fallen leaves of a tree that is worshipped as an idol, it should be permitted to derive benefit from them.",
    "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> The reason the leaves are not permitted is <b>because</b> the status of an object of <b>idol worship cannot be revoked</b> by <b>its</b> natural <b>manner of growth.</b> Since the falling of leaves is a natural phenomenon, their detachment from the tree does not effect a revocation of their status as objects of idol worship.",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 13b): With regard to a bird’s <b>nest at the top of a tree that belongs to the Temple</b> treasury, one <b>may not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one derived benefit from it, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of property consecrated to the Temple. With regard to a nest that is <b>at the top of a tree</b> used as part of idolatrous rites <b>[<i>ashera</i>],</b> although one may not climb the tree, as that would be benefiting from an object of idol worship, he <b>may knock</b> the nest off <b>with a pole</b> and benefit from it by using it for firewood and the like.",
    "In analyzing this <i>baraita</i>, <b>it enters your mind</b> that this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the bird <b>broke off branches from</b> the worshipped tree <b>and built a nest with them. And</b> yet, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that one may <b>knock</b> the nest off <b>with a pole</b> and it is then permitted to benefit from it. Apparently, the forbidden branches used in the construction of the nest lost their idolatrous status without human involvement, in accordance with the opinion of Reish Lakish that an idol that breaks loses its status.",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the bird <b>brought branches from elsewhere and built a nest with them</b> on top of the worshipped tree. The branches were never part of an object of idol worship.",
    "The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> if read with this understanding, <b>as it teaches with regard to</b> a nest in <b>a consecrated</b> tree: One <b>may not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but</b> if one derived benefit from it, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>Granted, if you say that</b> the bird <b>brought branches from elsewhere, this</b> explanation is consistent with that <b>which</b> the mishna <b>teaches with regard to</b> a nest in <b>a consecrated</b> tree, namely, that one <b>may not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>but</b> if one derived benefit from it, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. According to this understanding of the mishna, one <b>may not</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the nest <b>by rabbinic law, but</b> if one derived benefit from it, he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property <b>by Torah law, as</b> the branches <b>are not consecrated,</b> but were brought from elsewhere.",
    "<b>But if you say that</b> the bird <b>broke off branches from</b> the tree itself <b>and built a nest with them, why</b> is it taught that one who derives benefit from it is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property? <b>Aren’t</b> the branches <b>consecrated?</b> Evidently, the mishna is referring to a nest that was built with branches from other trees, in accordance with Rabbi Yoḥanan’s understanding that an object of idol worship that broke on its own is still forbidden.",
    "The Gemara responds to this proof for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s understanding of the mishna: Does this <b>argument</b> prove <b>anything?</b> The mishna can still be interpreted as referring to a case where the branches for the nest came from the tree itself, and <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case of <b>growths that came afterward,</b> i.e., branches that grew after the tree was consecrated, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibition against the <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>with regard to</b> such <b>growths.</b>",
    "Another explanation of the mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan is presented. <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> does it mean that one <b>may knock</b> off the nest? It means that one <b>may knock</b> off <b>the chicks;</b> but one may not derive benefit from the nest itself.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ya’akov said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Taḥlifa: I will explain</b> the mishna <b>to you: With regard to</b> the <b>chicks,</b> which can fly away and are not confined to the tree, both <b>here and there,</b> i.e., both in the case of a tree consecrated to the Temple treasury and in the case of a tree used for idol worship, deriving benefit from them is <b>permitted.</b> But <b>with regard to</b> the <b>eggs,</b> both <b>here and there,</b> i.e., both in the case of a tree consecrated to the Temple treasury and in the case of a tree used for idol worship, deriving benefit from them is <b>prohibited,</b> as they are not seen as independent of the tree. <b>Rav Ashi</b> added to this and <b>said: And chicks that</b> still <b>need their mother</b> to survive <b>are</b> considered <b>like eggs;</b> deriving benefit from them is prohibited.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who finds vessels, and upon them is a figure of the sun, a figure of the moon,</b> or <b>a figure of a dragon, he must take them</b> and cast them <b>into the Dead Sea</b> and not derive any benefit from them, as they are assumed to be objects of idol worship. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> Those figures <b>that</b> are <b>upon respectable</b> vessels <b>are forbidden.</b> Those <b>that are upon disgraceful vessels are permitted.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks with regard to the specific figures listed in the mishna: <b>Is this to say that</b> people <b>worship only these</b> figures, <b>but not</b> any <b>other item? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this list and that which is taught in another mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 39b): With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>for the sake of,</b> i.e., to worship, <b>seas, for the sake of rivers, for the sake of the wilderness, for the sake of the sun, for the sake of the moon, for the sake of the stars and constellations, for the sake of Michael the great ministering</b> angel, or even <b>for the sake of a small worm,</b> in all of <b>these</b> cases, the animal is forbidden, as these animals have the status of <b>offerings to the dead,</b> i.e., idols.",
    "<b>Abaye said</b> in response to the contradiction: With regard to <b>worship,</b> people might <b>worship any</b> item <b>that they find.</b> With regard to <b>fashioning</b> figures <b>and</b> then <b>worshipping</b> them, only with regard to <b>these three</b> items listed in the mishna, <b>which are important,</b> do people <b>fashion</b> figures of <b>them and worship them. With regard to</b> figures of any <b>other entity,</b> people <b>make them merely for ornamental</b> purposes.",
    "<b>Rav Sheshet would consolidate the principles of the <i>baraitot</i></b> pertaining to this matter <b>and teach:</b> Figures of <b>all constellations are permitted, except for</b> the following <b>celestial objects: The sun and the moon. And</b> figures of <b>all faces are permitted, except for the human face. And all figures</b> of other items <b>are permitted except for the figure of a dragon.</b>",
    "<b>The Master said:</b> Figures of <b>all constellations are permitted, except for</b> the following <b>celestial objects: The sun and the moon.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with here? If we say</b> that the reference is <b>to one who forms</b> these figures, i.e., <b>if</b> Rav Sheshet is discussing the issue <b>of</b> which figures it is permitted to <b>form, is</b> forming figures of <b>all the</b> other <b>constellations permitted? But isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me</b> gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make for you” (Exodus 20:20)? This verse is interpreted to mean: <b>You shall not make figures of My attendants who serve before Me on high,</b> i.e., those celestial bodies, including the constellations, that were created to serve God.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>finds</b> vessels with these figures on them, <b>and</b> this is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who finds vessels, and upon them is a figure of the sun, a figure of the moon,</b> or <b>a figure of a dragon, he must take them</b> and cast them <b>into the Dead Sea.</b> This indicates that it is permitted to derive benefit from any other vessels that were found and that had figures on them.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> one <b>finds</b> vessels with these figures on them, <b>say the middle clause</b> of Rav Sheshet’s statement: Figures of <b>all faces are permitted, except for the human face.</b> Now, <b>if</b> it is a case <b>where</b> one <b>finds</b> vessels with figures on them, <b>is</b> a vessel with the figure of <b>the human face forbidden? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who finds vessels, and upon them is a figure of the sun, a figure of the moon,</b> or <b>a figure of a dragon, he must take them</b> and cast them <b>into the Dead Sea?</b> This indicates that a vessel with <b>the figure of a dragon is</b> forbidden, but a vessel with the figure of <b>a human face is not.</b>",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara concludes, it is <b>obvious</b> that the statement that the figure of a human face is forbidden is referring to a case <b>where one forms</b> a figure, <b>and</b> this is prohibited, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who states (43b) that the interpretation of the verse: “You shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make for you” (Exodus 20:20), is: Do not make of Me, i.e., do not form the figure of a person, who was created in the image of God.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where one forms</b> a figure, <b>say the last clause</b> of Rav Sheshet’s statement: <b>All figures are permitted except for the figure of a dragon. And if</b> it is referring to a case <b>where one forms</b> a figure, <b>is</b> forming <b>the figure of a dragon prohibited? But isn’t it written: “You shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold”?</b>"
