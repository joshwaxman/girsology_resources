    "is <b>liable,</b> even though these substances are repugnant, and even when this is not the typical manner of worshipping that idol. <b>Granted,</b> when one pours <b>a chamber pot of urine</b> before the idol, <b>there is</b> an act of <b>throwing</b> that <b>scatters</b> the offering. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>excrement, what</b> act of <b>throwing</b> that <b>scatters</b> the offering <b>is there?</b> The Gemara answers: This is stated <b>with regard to moist excrement,</b> which breaks apart when thrown.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that one’s liability for breaking a stick as a form of idol worship is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> If one <b>slaughtered a locust for</b> an idol, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>liable, and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from punishment.",
    "<b>What, is it not about this</b> issue <b>that they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>we say</b> that one is liable even in the case of a rite that merely <b>resembles slaughtering</b> an animal, e.g., slaughtering a locust or breaking a stick. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not say</b> that it is sufficient for the rite to merely <b>resemble slaughtering</b> an animal. <b>Rather,</b> the rite must be <b>like</b> the type of slaughtering performed <b>inside</b> the Temple. One is therefore not liable for slaughtering a locust, since locusts are not slaughtered in the Temple.",
    "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, everyone</b> holds that <b>we do not say</b> that one is liable even for a rite that merely <b>resembles slaughtering</b> an animal. <b>Rather, we require</b> the rite to be <b>like</b> the type of slaughtering performed <b>inside</b> the Temple. <b>And</b> the case of <b>a locust is different, since its neck is similar to</b> the <b>neck of an animal.</b> Rabbi Yehuda therefore considers slaughtering a locust similar to the type of slaughter performed in the Temple.",
    "§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of an object of <b>idol worship that is worshipped by</b> means of <b>a stick,</b> if one <b>broke a stick before it,</b> he is <b>liable and</b> the stick <b>is rendered prohibited.</b> If he <b>threw a stick before it,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as its typical manner of worship involves a stick, <b>but</b> the stick <b>is not rendered prohibited.</b>",
    "<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: What is different</b> about the case where one <b>broke</b> a stick? In this case the stick is rendered forbidden <b>as it is similar to slaughtering</b> an offering, which is a rite performed in the Temple; so <b>too,</b> in the case where one <b>threw</b> a stick, <b>it is similar to</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood on the altar. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: In order for a sacrificial rite to be similar to the sprinkling of blood, <b>we require</b> a form of <b>throwing</b> that <b>scatters</b> the offering, <b>and</b> that is <b>not</b> the case here.",
    "Rava asked Rav Naḥman: <b>If that is so, by what</b> means are the <b>stones of a place of</b> worship dedicated to <b>Mercury rendered prohibited,</b> as they do not break apart when they are thrown? Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: This question <b>was difficult for me as well, and I asked Rabba bar Avuh</b> about <b>it, and Rabba bar Avuh</b> asked <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav, and Ḥiyya bar Rav</b> asked <b>Rav. And</b> Rav <b>said to</b> Ḥiyya bar Rav: This action <b>is comparable to</b> the act of <b>enlarging</b> the object of <b>idol worship.</b> The stones are not rendered prohibited as an offering brought in idol worship; rather, they are considered part of the pile dedicated to Mercury itself.",
    "Rava said to Rav Naḥman: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that the object of <b>idol worship of a gentile</b> is <b>prohibited immediately. But according to the one who says</b> it is not forbidden <b>until it is worshipped, let it be permitted, as he did not worship it,</b> since he sacrificed no offering to it. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Each and every one</b> of the stones <b>becomes</b> part of the object of <b>idol worship and</b> is also considered <b>an offering to the other</b> stone that preceded it.",
    "Rava replied: <b>If so, at least the last</b> stone <b>should be permitted,</b> as nothing has yet been sacrificed to it. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>If you know</b> which one <b>it</b> is, you may <b>go</b> and <b>take it,</b> as it is indeed permitted. <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> Even the last stone is forbidden, as <b>each and every one</b> of the stones <b>becomes an offering to itself and</b> also <b>an offering to the other</b> stone that preceded it.",
    "<b>We learned</b> in a mishna (51b): If one <b>found a garment, money, or vessels at the head of</b> Mercury, <b>they are permitted,</b> as they are not an offering but were left there for some other reason. If one found vine <b>branches [<i>parkilei</i>]</b> laden with clusters <b>of grapes, or wreaths</b> made <b>of stalks, or</b> containers of <b>wine, oil, or flour, or any</b> other <b>item the like of which is sacrificed on</b> the <b>altar</b> there, that item is <b>prohibited.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to <b>wine, oil, or flour, there is</b> a sacrificial rite <b>comparable to</b> those rites performed <b>inside</b> the Temple, <b>and there is</b> a rite that is <b>similar to</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of blood that <b>scatters</b> the offering. <b>But</b> in the case of vine <b>branches</b> laden with clusters <b>of grapes, and wreaths</b> made <b>of stalks, there is neither</b> a sacrificial rite <b>comparable to</b> those rites performed <b>inside</b> the Temple, as these items are not sacrificed on the altar in the Temple, <b>nor is there</b> a rite that is <b>similar to</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of blood on the altar that <b>scatters</b> the offering.",
    "<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Ulla said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> he <b>initially picked</b> the grapes <b>for that</b> purpose, in order to sacrifice them in idolatrous worship. The act of picking the fruit is comparable to slaughtering an animal, and it renders them forbidden.",
    "§ <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>concerning one who slaughters a blemished animal in idolatrous worship that he is exempt?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “He that sacrifices to the gods, save to the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed”</b> (Exodus 22:19). The verse contrasts sacrificing an offering to the Lord with sacrificing an offering to other gods, indicating that <b>the Torah prohibits only</b> sacrificial rites that are <b>comparable to</b> those rites performed <b>inside</b> the Temple, and blemished animals are disqualified from being sacrificed in the Temple.",
    "<b>Rava discussed</b> this matter: <b>With regard to what</b> type of blemish does this apply? <b>If we say</b> that it applies <b>in</b> the case of a blemish <b>on the cornea of the eye,</b> that is difficult: <b>Now</b> that such an offering is <b>fit for descendants of Noah</b> to offer <b>to the Most High on their</b> personal <b>altar, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that it is considered an offering <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship?</b>",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one who slaughters a blemished animal in idolatrous worship is exempt is stated <b>with regard to</b> an animal that is <b>lacking a limb, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar. As Rabbi Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>with regard to</b> an animal <b>that is lacking a limb, it is prohibited for descendants of Noah</b> to sacrifice it? This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every</b> sort you shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you” (Genesis 6:19). <b>The Torah stated:</b> “Of every living thing,” indicating that Noah should <b>bring</b> into the ark <b>an animal whose extremities are living,</b> as some of the animals would subsequently be used as offerings.",
    "The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>that</b> phrase: <b>“And of every living thing,” required to exclude an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> which is disqualified as an offering? The Gemara answers: The disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> is <b>derived from</b> the verse: “Of the fowl also of the air, seven and seven, male and female, <b>to keep seed alive</b> upon the face of all the earth” (Genesis 7:3), as a <i>tereifa</i> cannot procreate.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot bear offspring. But according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can bear offspring, what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, a <i>tereifa</i> cannot be excluded by the phrase “to keep seed alive,” as it can procreate.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive <b>with you”</b> (Genesis 6:19). The term <b>“with you”</b> indicates that the verse is referring <b>to</b> animals that are <b>similar to you,</b> excluding a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps Noah himself was a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> In that case, one cannot exclude a <i>tereifa</i> from the comparison of animals to Noah. The Gemara explains: <b>It is written about</b> Noah that he was “a man righteous and <b>without blemish”</b> (Genesis 6:9), indicating that he was physically whole.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>Perhaps</b> the term <b>“without blemish”</b> is referring <b>to his conduct,</b> and not to his physical attributes. The Gemara explains: The term <b>“righteous” is written about him,</b> indicating that his conduct was faultless, and therefore the term “without blemish” is necessarily referring to his physical completeness.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>Perhaps</b> the term <b>“without blemish”</b> is referring <b>to his conduct, and</b> the term <b>“righteous”</b> is referring <b>to his</b> good <b>deeds.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>You cannot say that Noah himself was a <i>tereifa</i>, as, if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>Noah was a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> you must say that <b>the Merciful One said to</b> Noah: <b>Bring</b> into the ark animals <b>that are similar to you,</b> i.e., <i>tereifot</i>, but <b>do not bring whole,</b> unblemished animals, and this is clearly not reasonable.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Now that</b> the disqualification of a <i>tereifa</i> <b>is derived from</b> the term <b>“with you,” why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“to keep seed alive”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> one excluded a <i>tereifa</i> only <b>from</b> the term <b>“with you,” I would say</b> that Noah brought the animals into the ark <b>merely for</b> the purpose of <b>companionship, and</b> therefore <b>even an aged</b> animal who could not bear offspring <b>and even one who was castrated</b> could be brought into the ark. The phrase <b>“to keep seed alive”</b> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that only animals that could reproduce were brought into the ark.",
    "§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says: From where</b> is it derived <b>concerning one who slaughters an animal</b> as an offering <b>to Mercury that he is liable</b> even though it is not typically worshipped in this manner? This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And they shall not slaughter their offerings anymore to the <i>se’irim</i></b> after whom they go astray; this shall be to them an eternal statute, throughout their generations” (Leviticus 17:7). <b>If</b> this verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of</b> prohibiting the worship of an idol in <b>its</b> typical <b>manner,</b> it must apply to another matter. The verse cannot be referring to idols that are typically worshipped by slaughtering offerings, <b>as</b> this prohibition <b>is written</b> in the verse: “And lest you inquire after their gods, saying: <b>How do these nations serve their gods?</b> Even so will I do likewise” (Deuteronomy 12:30). One must therefore <b>apply</b> the verse to the <b>matter of</b> prohibiting the worship of an idol in <b>an atypical manner.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>this</b> verse, <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>this</b> prohibition? <b>This</b> verse <b>is required for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the prohibition against sacrificing offerings outside the Tabernacle:"
