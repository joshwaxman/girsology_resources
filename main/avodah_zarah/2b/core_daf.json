    "<b>with their scholars, as it is stated: “And let the peoples [<i>le’umim</i>] be assembled”</b> (Isaiah 43:9); <b>and</b> the term <b><i>le’om</i></b> means <b>nothing other than kingdom, as it is stated: “And the one kingdom [<i>ule’om</i>] shall be stronger than the other kingdom [<i>mile’om</i>]”</b> (Genesis 25:23). The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> it possible for <b>there</b> to be <b>intermingling before the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> that it should be necessary for each nation to stand and be addressed separately? <b>Rather,</b> the nations are instructed to stand separately <b>so that they will not become intermingled with each other</b> in order <b>that they will</b> each <b>hear what He says to them.</b>",
    "<b>Immediately, the Roman Empire enters first before Him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that the Roman Empire enters first? It is <b>because</b> the Roman Empire is the most <b>important</b> of all of the nations. <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that it is</b> the most <b>important? As it is written</b> in the book of Daniel with regard to the fourth empire that will rule over the world: <b>“And it shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces”</b> (Daniel 7:23), and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This</b> empire that will devour the earth is <b>the wicked Roman</b> Empire, <b>whose name spread throughout the world.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that whoever is</b> more <b>important enters first?</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda says:</b> When <b>a king and a community</b> are brought before God for judgment, the <b>king enters for judgment first, as it is stated: “That He make the judgment of His servant and the judgment of His people Israel,</b> as every day shall require” (I Kings 8:59). <b>And what is the reason</b> that it is important for the king to enter first? <b>If you wish, say</b> that it is <b>not proper conduct for the king to stand outside</b> and wait for the trial of his subjects to end. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the king is brought in first so that he may be judged <b>before</b> God’s <b>anger intensifies</b> due to the sins of the community.",
    "The Gemara returns to its narration of the future judgment. First, the members of the Roman Empire enter. <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them: With what did you occupy yourselves? They say before Him</b> in response: <b>Master of the Universe, we have established many marketplaces, we have built many bathhouses,</b> and <b>we have increased much silver and gold. And we did all</b> of this <b>only for</b> the sake of <b>the Jewish people, so that they would</b> be free to <b>engage in Torah</b> study.",
    "<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them: Fools of the world!</b> Are you attempting to deceive Me? <b>Everything that you did, you did for your own needs. You established marketplaces to place prostitutes in them;</b> you built <b>bathhouses for your own enjoyment;</b> and as for the <b>silver and gold</b> that you claim to have increased, <b>it is Mine, as it is stated: “Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, said the Lord of hosts”</b> (Haggai 2:8).",
    "<b>Is there no one among you who can declare</b> that they have studied <b>this</b> Torah? This is the meaning of the continuation of the verse from Isaiah, <b>as it is stated: “Who among them can declare this?”</b> (Isaiah 43:9). <b>And “this”</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than</b> the <b>Torah, as it is stated: “And this is the Torah that Moses set</b> before the children of Israel” (Deuteronomy 4:44), and whoever did not engage in its study does not receive reward. <b>Immediately,</b> the members of the Roman Empire <b>leave disappointed.</b>",
    "<b>The Roman Empire leaves, and the Persian Empire enters after it. What is the reason</b> that the Persian Empire enters second? The reason is <b>that after</b> the Roman Empire it is the next most <b>important. And from where do we</b> derive this? <b>As it is written</b> in Daniel’s vision: <b>“And behold another beast, a second, like a bear”</b> (Daniel 7:5). <b>And Rav Yosef teaches: These are the Persians,</b> who are compared to a bear, <b>as they eat and drink</b> copious amounts <b>as</b> does <b>a bear, and they are fleshy like a bear, and they grow</b> their <b>hair</b> long <b>as</b> does <b>a bear, and they never rest, like a bear,</b> which is constantly on the move from one place to another.",
    "<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them: With what did you occupy yourselves? They say before Him</b> in response: <b>Master of the Universe, we have built many bridges, we have conquered many cities,</b> and <b>we have fought many wars. And we did all</b> of this <b>only for</b> the sake of <b>the Jewish people, so that they would engage in Torah</b> study.",
    "<b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them: Everything that you did, you did for your own needs. You established bridges to collect taxes from</b> all who pass over <b>them.</b> You conquered <b>cities to use</b> their residents for <b>forced labor [<i>angareya</i>];</b> and with regard to fighting the <b>wars, I wage</b> wars, and your success is from Me, <b>as it is stated: “The Lord is a man of war”</b> (Exodus 15:3). <b>Is there no one among you who can declare</b> that they have studied <b>this</b> Torah? <b>As it is stated: “Who among them can declare this”</b> (Isaiah 43:9), <b>and “this”</b> is referring to <b>nothing other than the Torah, as it is stated: “And this is the Torah that Moses set”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:44). <b>Immediately,</b> the members of the Persian Empire <b>leave from before Him disappointed.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But once the Persian Empire sees that</b> everything said by <b>the Roman Empire is completely ineffective, what is the reason</b> that they <b>come</b> forward? The Gemara answers: They believe that their claims will be more effective, as <b>they say:</b> The Romans <b>destroyed the</b> Second <b>Temple, and we</b> had <b>built</b> it, as the Second Temple was constructed under the auspices and with the encouragement of Cyrus, the king of Persia. The Gemara adds: <b>And likewise,</b> a similar exchange occurred <b>with each and every nation.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But once</b> the other nations <b>see that</b> every-thing said by <b>the first ones,</b> Rome and Persia, <b>is completely ineffective, what is the reason</b> that they <b>come</b> forward? The Gemara answers that <b>they think: Those</b> Empires <b>subjugated the Jewish people, but we did not subjugate the Jewish people.</b> The Gemara further asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>these,</b> Rome and Persia, <b>which were singled out</b> explicitly, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>those</b> other empires that come afterward, <b>which were not singled out</b> and mentioned by name? It is <b>because</b> with regard to <b>these,</b> Rome and Persia, <b>their kingship extends until the coming of the Messiah.</b>",
    "The nations will <b>say before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, did You give us</b> the Torah <b>and we did not accept it?</b> Since we never received the Torah, why are we being judged for not fulfilling its mitzvot? The Gemara asks: <b>And can one say that</b> they were never offered the Torah? <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the description of the giving of the Torah: <b>“And he said: The Lord came from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), <b>and it is written: “God comes from Teman,</b> and the Holy One from mount Paran” (Habakkuk 3:3). And the Sages asked: <b>What</b> did God <b>require in Seir and what</b> did He <b>require in Paran?</b> The Torah was not given in those locations.",
    "And <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, took</b> the Torah <b>around to every nation and</b> those who speak every <b>language,</b> such as the Edomites in Seir and the Ishmaelites in Paran, <b>but they did not accept it, until He came to the Jewish people and they accepted it.</b> If the other nations all rejected the Torah, how can they excuse themselves by claiming that it was never offered to them?",
    "<b>Rather, this</b> is what <b>they say: Did we accept</b> the Torah <b>and</b> then <b>not fulfill</b> its mitzvot? The Gemara asks: <b>But this</b> itself <b>serves as the refutation of their</b> own claim, as one can respond: <b>Why didn’t you accept it? Rather, this</b> is what the nations of the world <b>say before Him: Master of the Universe, did You overturn the mountain above us like a basin, and we</b> still <b>did not accept</b> the Torah, <b>as You did for the Jewish people?</b>",
    "The Gemara provides the background for this claim: <b>As it is written: “And they stood at the nether part of the mount”</b> (Exodus 19:17), <b>and Rav Dimi bar Ḥama says:</b> The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, overturned the mountain,</b> i.e., Mount Sinai, <b>above the Jews like a basin, and</b> He <b>said to them: If you accept the Torah, excellent, and if not, there,</b> under the mountain, <b>will be your burial.</b> The nations of the world will claim that they too could have been coerced to accept the Torah.",
    "<b>Immediately, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says to them: The first</b> mitzvot <b>will let us hear</b> the truth, <b>as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the same verse under discussion: <b>“And announce to us the first things”</b> (Isaiah 43:9). With regard to the <b>seven</b> Noahide <b>mitzvot</b> that preceded the giving of the Torah <b>that</b> even <b>you accepted, where</b> is the proof that <b>you fulfilled them?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that they did not fulfill them? As Rav Yosef teaches</b> in explanation of the verse: <b>“He stands, and shakes the earth, He sees, and makes the nations tremble [<i>vayater</i>]”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6): <b>What did</b> God <b>see? He saw</b> the <b>seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselves, and</b> He saw that they <b>did not fulfill them. Since they did not fulfill them, He arose and nullified for them [<i>vehitiran</i>]</b> the command to heed these mitzvot. The Gemara asks: Do they <b>gain</b> from not obeying, as they are now released from the obligation to fulfill these mitzvot? <b>If so, we find</b> that <b>a sinner profits</b> from his transgression.",
