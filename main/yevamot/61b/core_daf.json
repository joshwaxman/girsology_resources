    "<b>and he has children, he may not marry a sexually underdeveloped woman, as she is the <i>zona</i></b> about whom it is <b>stated in the Torah</b> that a priest may not marry her. <b>It is priests who were commanded</b> not to marry <b>a <i>zona</i>, but Israelites were not commanded</b> this. It is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>he taught</b> the first clause of the mishna about <b>a priest,</b> even though that <i>halakha</i> applies equally to Israelites.",
    "<b>Rav Huna said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? As it is written: “And they shall eat, and not have enough, they shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase”</b> (Hosea 4:10). He expounds the verse as follows: <b>Any intercourse that does not</b> have the possibility to <b>increase</b> the population because the woman is incapable of having children, <b>is nothing other</b> than <b>licentious sexual intercourse.</b>",
    "§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A priest may not marry a minor. Rav Ḥisda said to Rabba: Go</b> and <b>investigate</b> this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as in the evening Rav Huna</b> will <b>ask you</b> the reason for Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling. <b>He went</b> and <b>investigated it,</b> and arrived at the following conclusion: <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and he</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
    "Rabba explains: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who</b> says that <b>one must be concerned for the minority.</b> Rabbi Meir does not allow one to assume that an unknown case is similar to the majority of cases. Consequently, one must take into account the possibility that a minor will turn out to be sexually underdeveloped, although this will not be true of most individuals. <b>And</b> he also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>a sexually underdeveloped woman is a <i>zona</i></b> and therefore forbidden to a priest.",
    "The Gemara challenges Rabba’s explanation: <b>And does</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A boy minor and a girl minor may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i> or levirate marriage;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Meir: You spoke well</b> when you said <b>that they may not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> as the term <b>“man” is written in the passage</b> of <i>ḥalitza</i> (Deuteronomy 25:7–10), which limits the <i>halakha</i> to an adult male, <b>and we compare a woman to a man</b> and therefore limit <i>ḥalitza</i> to an adult woman. <b>However, what is the reason</b> that <b>they may not perform levirate marriage?</b>",
    "Rabbi Meir <b>said to them: A boy minor</b> may not perform levirate marriage <b>lest he be found</b> to be <b>a eunuch,</b> i.e., one who is incapable of fathering children for his late brother. Similarly, <b>a girl minor</b> may not perform levirate marriage <b>lest she be found</b> to be <b>sexually underdeveloped</b> when she grows up. In either case, the mitzva of levirate marriage does not apply, <b>and they turn out</b> to have <b>encountered a forbidden relative. And it was taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>A girl minor enters into levirate marriage but does not perform <i>ḥalitza</i>;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> This proves that Rabbi Eliezer disagrees with Rabbi Meir and is not concerned that a girl may turn out to be sexually underdeveloped.",
    "The Gemara continues to challenge Rabba’s explanation of Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling. <b>And does</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? Wasn’t it is taught in</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>zona</i></b> forbidden to a priest is as <b>the name <i>zona</i></b> implies, i.e., a married woman who committed adultery; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva says: A <i>zona</i> is</b> a woman, even an unmarried woman, <b>who</b> is <b>available</b> to all, i.e., she has intercourse with whoever is interested. <b>Rabbi Matya ben Ḥarash says: Even</b> if <b>her husband went to make her drink</b> the bitter waters after she disregarded his warning not to seclude herself with a certain man, and <b>he had intercourse with her on the way, he has</b> thereby <b>caused her</b> to become <b>a <i>zona</i></b> because she was forbidden to him at the time, despite the fact that she is his wife.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A <i>zona</i> is a sexually underdeveloped woman. And the Rabbis say:</b> The term <b><i>zona</i></b> applies <b>only to a female convert, a freed</b> maidservant, <b>and one who engaged in licentious sexual intercourse. Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Even in the case of <b>an unmarried man who had intercourse with an unmarried woman not for the purpose of marriage, he has</b> thereby <b>caused her</b> to become <b>a <i>zona</i>.</b> This <i>baraita</i> proves that Rabbi Eliezer does not agree with Rabbi Yehuda.",
    "<b>Rather, Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling that a priest may not marry a minor must be explained differently: <b>Here we are dealing with a High Priest,</b> and the problem is as follows: <b>When can he acquire her</b> as his wife? Only <b>when she is grown up.</b> However, if they had started living together as husband and wife when she was a minor, then when she is grown up and the marriage can legally take effect, <b>she is</b> already <b>a non-virgin,</b> and a High Priest is commanded to marry a virgin.",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> This explanation is <b>without reason. If her father betrothed her</b> to her husband, her husband <b>acquired her from that time,</b> as betrothal that a father carries out on his daughter’s behalf when she is a minor is effective by Torah law. <b>And if</b> the minor <b>betrothed herself,</b> is <b>this Rabbi Eliezer’s</b> opinion <b>and not</b> that of <b>the Rabbis?</b> The Rabbis would certainly agree that a High Priest may not marry a minor under these circumstances.",
    "<b>Rather, Rava said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling includes <b>a common priest,</b> and the reason he cannot marry a minor is that <b>we are concerned lest she be seduced</b> by another man, due to her tender age and naïveté, while married <b>to him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the same concern should apply to <b>an Israelite also.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The seduction of a minor is</b> considered <b>rape, and a rape</b> victim remains <b>permitted</b> to her husband <b>in</b> a case where she is married to <b>an Israelite,</b> but not if she is married to a priest.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling applies specifically <b>to a High Priest, and it is</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“A virgin</b> of his own people shall he take for a wife [<i>isha</i>]” (Leviticus 21:14), one <b>might</b> have thought a High Priest may marry <b>a minor; the verse</b> therefore <b>states</b> that he must marry <b>a woman [<i>isha</i>],</b> i.e., an adult. <b>If</b> he must marry a <b>woman,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought it means <b>a grown woman. The verse</b> therefore <b>states</b> that he must marry <b>a virgin,</b> which excludes a grown woman, who is considered only a partial virgin because her hymen is not fully intact. <b>How so?</b> He must marry a woman who <b>has left the class of minority but</b> who <b>has not</b> yet <b>reached the class of grown womanhood,</b> i.e., he must marry a maiden.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The High Priest must marry <b>a virgin, and</b> the term <b>virgin</b> refers <b>only</b> to <b>a maiden. And</b> a verse <b>similarly states: “And the maiden was very fair to look upon, a virgin,</b> and no man had known her” (Genesis 24:16).",
    "The <i>baraita</i> cited above mentioned that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the case of <b>an unmarried man who had intercourse with an unmarried woman not for the purpose of marriage, he has caused her</b> to become <b>a <i>zona</i>. Rav Amram said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A man may not neglect</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply unless he</b> already <b>has children. Beit Shammai say:</b> One fulfills this mitzva with <b>two males, and Beit Hillel say: A male and a female, as it is stated: “Male and female He created them”</b> (Genesis 5:2).",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna’s wording that if <b>he</b> already <b>has children he may neglect</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply,</b> but <b>he may not neglect</b> the mitzva to have <b>a wife.</b> This <b>supports</b> what <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> in the name of <b>Shmuel, who said: Even</b> if <b>a man has several children, it is prohibited to remain without a wife, as it is stated: “It is not good that the man should be alone”</b> (Genesis 2:18).",
    "<b>And some say</b> a different version of the inference from the mishna: If <b>he</b> already <b>has children, he may neglect</b> the mitzva to <b>be fruitful and multiply and</b> he <b>may also neglect</b> the mitzva to have <b>a wife. Shall we say</b> this <b>is a conclusive refutation of</b> what <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel</b> said? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it means that <b>if he does not have children he must marry a woman</b> capable <b>of</b> bearing <b>children,</b> whereas if <b>he has children he may marry a woman who is not</b> capable <b>of</b> bearing <b>children. A practical difference</b> between a man who has children and one who does not is whether he is permitted <b>to sell a Torah scroll in order to</b> marry a woman capable of having <b>children.</b> This is permitted only for one who does not yet have children.",
    "§ The mishna states that <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that one fulfills the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply when he has <b>two males.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Beit Shammai?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>We learn</b> this <b>from Moses as it is written: “The sons of Moses, Gershom and Eliezer”</b> (I Chronicles 23:15). Since Moses did not have any other children, two sons must be sufficient to fulfill the mitzva. <b>And</b> the reason of <b>Beit Hillel</b> is that <b>we learn from the creation of the world,</b> as mankind was created male and female. The Gemara asks: <b>And Beit Shammai, let them learn from the creation of the world</b> as well. The Gemara answers that Beit Shammai could say to you: <b>We do not derive</b> a case where it is <b>possible</b>"
