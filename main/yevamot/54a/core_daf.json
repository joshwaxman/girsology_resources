    "<b>a sleeping</b> man <b>has not acquired his <i>yevama</i>,</b> as he did not intend to perform the act of intercourse at all? <b>Rather,</b> the mishna was referring <b>to one who was inserted</b> into his <i>yevama</i> by accident. But <b>didn’t Rabba say:</b> One who <b>fell from a roof and was inserted</b> into a woman due to the force of his fall <b>is liable</b> to pay <b>four</b> of the five <b>types of indemnity</b> that must be paid by one who damaged another: Injury, pain, medical costs, and loss of livelihood. However, he is not liable to pay for the shame he caused her, as he did not intend to perform the act, <b>and if</b> she is <b>his <i>yevama</i>, he has not acquired</b> her in this manner.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> it is a case <b>where he intended</b> to have intercourse with <b>his wife</b> and became erect, <b>and his <i>yevama</i></b> forcefully <b>grabbed hold of him and he had intercourse with her.</b> The Gemara further asks: If so, <b>what are the circumstances</b> of the case when <b>both of them were coerced</b> that was mentioned by <b>the school of Rabbi Ḥiyya?</b> The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where he intended</b> to have intercourse with <b>his wife, and gentiles grabbed hold of him and pressed</b> him and his <i>yevama</i> <b>against each other, and he</b> thereby <b>had intercourse with her.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara inquires as to the source of these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse <b>“Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), that this indicates that the act of intercourse in this circumstance is <b>a mitzva,</b> i.e., it is preferable to the alternative, which is <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>Alternatively,</b> the verse <b>“Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her,”</b> indicates that it does not matter how he had intercourse with her, <b>whether unwittingly or intentionally, whether</b> due to <b>coercion or willingly.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t you derive</b> from this phrase that the act of intercourse in this case is a <b>mitzva?</b> How can the same phrase also indicate that it does not matter what the intentions of the two parties were during the act of intercourse? The Gemara answers: The fact that it is <b>a mitzva is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And if the man does not wish</b> to take his <i>yevama</i>” (Deuteronomy 25:7), which indicates that if he <b>wishes, he performs levirate marriage,</b> which is preferable to <i>ḥalitza</i>. Therefore, <b>when</b> the <b>verse</b> cited above <b>came,</b> it indicated that levirate marriage has occurred <b>whether</b> the parties acted <b>unwittingly or intentionally, whether</b> due to <b>coercion or willingly.</b>",
    "<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that the phrase: <b>“Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> indicates that levirate marriage has been performed if they engage in <b>typical</b> sexual intercourse. The next phrase, <b>“and take her,”</b> includes even <b>atypical,</b> i.e., anal, sexual intercourse. The concluding phrase of the verse, <b>“and consummate the levirate marriage,”</b> indicates that <b>sexual intercourse completes her</b> acquisition, <b>but money and a</b> marriage <b>document do not complete her</b> acquisition to him as his fully betrothed wife, in contrast to the regular <i>halakhot</i> of marriage. By emphasizing <b>“and consummate the levirate marriage with her,”</b> the verse teaches that he acquires her even if he acted <b>against her will. Alternatively: “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> indicates that levirate marriage has occurred <b>whether</b> the parties acted <b>unwittingly</b> or intentionally, whether due to coercion or willingly.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t you derive</b> from this phrase that levirate marriage has been performed if they engage in <b>typical</b> sexual intercourse? How can it also indicate that it does not matter what the intentions of the two parties were during the act of intercourse? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> a different verse: <b>“To establish a name for his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:7), which indicates that intercourse must occur <b>in the place where he establishes a name,</b> i.e., where it can lead to childbirth. Therefore, <b>when</b> the <b>verse</b> cited above <b>came,</b> it indicated that levirate marriage has occurred <b>whether</b> the parties acted <b>unwittingly or intentionally, whether</b> due to <b>coercion or willingly.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the previous discussion. <b>Rav Yehuda said: A sleeping</b> man <b>has not acquired his <i>yevama</i>, as the verse states: “Her brother-in-law will have intercourse with her”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that he does not acquire her <b>unless he intends</b> to act <b>for the sake of sexual intercourse.</b> Since a sleeping man does not intend to engage in sexual intercourse, he does not acquire his <i>yevama</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one acquires his <i>yevama</i> through sexual intercourse regardless of <b>whether he</b> was <b>awake or asleep?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> the <i>baraita</i> in the following emended form: <b>Whether she</b> was <b>awake or asleep.</b> The woman’s awareness is not a necessary component in order to perform levirate marriage.",
    "The Gemara asks further: <b>Wasn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that one acquires his <i>yevama</i> through sexual intercourse regardless of <b>whether he was awake or he was asleep</b> and regardless of <b>whether she was awake or she was asleep?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> when the <i>baraita</i> says that a sleeping man acquires his <i>yevama</i>? It is referring to a man <b>who is dozing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>dozing? Rav Ashi said:</b> One is <b>asleep but not asleep, awake but not awake, when,</b> if <b>they call him, he</b> will <b>answer, but he is unable to provide a reasonable</b> answer. <b>And when they</b> later <b>inform him</b> of what happened, <b>he remembers</b> it.",
    "The Gemara returns to the statement of Rabba cited earlier in order to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> that Rabba addressed. <b>Rabba said:</b> One who <b>fell from a roof and was inserted</b> into a woman due to the force of his fall <b>is liable</b> to pay <b>four</b> of the five <b>types of indemnity</b> that must be paid by one who damaged another, <b>and if</b> she is <b>his <i>yevama</i> he has not acquired</b> her in this manner. He is liable to pay for <b>injury, pain, loss of livelihood,</b> and <b>medical costs. However, he is not liable</b> to pay for the <b>shame</b> he caused her, <b>as the Master said: One is not liable</b> to pay <b>for shame unless he intends</b> to humiliate his victim. Consequently, one who fell from a roof accidentally is not liable to pay for the shame he caused the woman.",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> If <b>he intended to press</b> his sexual organ <b>into a wall, and he</b> accidentally <b>pressed</b> it <b>into his <i>yevama</i>, he has not acquired</b> her, as he did not intend to engage in an act of sexual intercourse. However, if he intended <b>to press</b> his sexual organ <b>into an animal, and he pressed</b> it <b>into his <i>yevama</i>, he has acquired</b> her, <b>as he</b> at least <b>intended</b> to act <b>for the purpose of sexual intercourse in general,</b> i.e., for some form of sexual intercourse.",
    "§ We learned in the mishna that <b>both one who</b> merely <b>begins the act of intercourse</b> and one who completes it has acquired the <i>yevama</i> through this act. <b>Ulla said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>the initial stage of intercourse</b> is considered an act of sexual intercourse <b>by Torah law? As it is stated: “And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness and shall uncover her nakedness, he has made naked [<i>he’era</i>] her fountain”</b> (Leviticus 20:18). The verse is referring to the first stage of intercourse, and <b>from here</b> it is derived that <b>the initial stage of intercourse [<i>ha’ara’a</i>]</b> is considered sexual intercourse <b>by Torah law.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> a source for this <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a menstruating woman,</b> the subject of the verse cited above. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the initial stage of intercourse is considered sexual intercourse with regard to <b>the rest of those with whom relations are forbidden? And if you say we should derive it from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a menstruating woman, what</b> comparison can be made <b>to a menstruating woman,</b> concerning whom the <i>halakha</i> is more stringent than others with whom relations are forbidden, <b>in that she causes one who has intercourse with her to become ritually impure?</b>",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> in other cases <b>comes from</b> a verse about <b>a brother’s wife, as it is written: “And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is impurity [<i>nidda</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 20:21). The word <i>nidda</i> generally refers to a menstruating woman, and so the Gemara asks: <b>Is his brother’s wife always menstruating? Rather,</b> it means that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to her is <b>like</b> that of <b>a menstruating woman: Just as</b> one is liable to receive punishment for violating the prohibition against engaging in sexual intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman through the initial stage of intercourse, so too,</b> one is liable to receive punishment for violating the prohibition against engaging in sexual intercourse with <b>a brother’s wife through the initial stage of intercourse.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> comparison can be made between <b>a brother’s wife</b> and other women with whom relations are forbidden? The prohibition with regard to a brother’s <b>wife is</b> more stringent in that <b>it is within his power to increase</b> the number of women forbidden by this prohibition, <b>as, if he wishes, he can go on betrothing a thousand</b> women, all of whom would be forbidden to his brother. Consequently, the prohibition with regard to a brother’s wife cannot serve as a model for other prohibitions.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> in other cases <b>comes from</b> a verse with regard to <b>a father’s sister and a mother’s sister, as it is written: “And you shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister nor of your father’s sister; for he has made naked [<i>he’era</i>] his kin”</b> (Leviticus 20:19). The Gemara asks: <b>It is</b> possible <b>to refute</b> this source as follows: <b>What</b> comparison can be made between other women with whom relations are forbidden and <b>a father’s sister and a mother’s sister, which are</b> unique in that they are prohibited due to <b>a prohibition that comes on its own?</b> The prohibition with regard to a father’s sister and a mother’s sister does not stem from marriage, but from the biological fact that she is his father’s or mother’s sister. It is therefore dissimilar to prohibitions that result from marriage.",
    "The Gemara states: The principle that the initial stage of intercourse is considered sexual intercourse <b>does not come from</b> any <b>one</b> of the sources cited above. <b>Let it come</b> by deriving the <i>halakha</i> in any <b>one</b> other case <b>from</b> the common denominator of <b>two</b> of the sources mentioned above. The Gemara asks: <b>From which</b> two sources could this principle <b>come</b> to be derived? If you say it can <b>come</b> to be derived <b>from</b> the combination of the source with regard to <b>a brother’s wife and</b> the source with regard to <b>a father’s sister and a mother’s sister, what</b> comparison may be drawn from these cases, <b>which are</b> unique in that they are <b>prohibited because</b> they are <b>kin?</b>",
    "<b>Rather, let it come from</b> the prohibition proscribing <b>a menstruating woman and</b> the prohibition with regard to <b>a father’s sister and a mother’s sister,</b> as a menstruating woman is not prohibited as a family relative. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>What</b> comparison may be drawn from these cases, <b>which are</b> each a <b>prohibition that comes of its own</b> accord, as neither one is created through marriage? <b>Rather, let it come from</b> the prohibition proscribing <b>a menstruating woman and</b> the prohibition proscribing <b>a brother’s wife. As, what</b> can you say to <b>refute</b> this teaching? These two cases do not share any unique features that might be cause for stringency.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, strongly objects to this: What</b> comparison may be drawn based upon the precedent of <b>a menstruating woman and a brother’s wife, which are</b> stringent in that <b>they cannot be permitted</b> to others for the duration of <b>the existence of the</b> factor <b>that renders them prohibited?</b> A menstruating woman is forbidden as long as she experiences a flow of menstrual blood, while a brother’s wife is forbidden for the duration of the brother’s lifetime. Can <b>you say</b> the same <b>with regard to a married woman, who can become permitted during the lifetime of the one who renders her prohibited,</b> i.e., if her husband divorces her?",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Is that to say</b> that <b>it is</b> only during <b>the existence of the</b> factor <b>that renders them prohibited that a menstruating woman and a brother’s wife cannot be permitted</b> to others, <b>but afterward,</b> when the prohibiting factor has been resolved, <b>they can be permitted?</b> In the case of <b>a menstruating woman,</b>"
