    "whereas with regard to the <b>children of rival wives, I testify to you</b> that they are not disqualified, since, as stated, their descendants served as High Priests.",
    "§ The Gemara states: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source that indicates Beit Shammai did act upon their opinions: <b>In the time of Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas, the rival wife of a daughter was permitted to the brothers. Conclude from this</b> that Beit Shammai <b>did act</b> in accordance with their opinions. The Gemara summarizes these proofs: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> these sources that Beit Shammai did put their rulings into practice.",
    "§ Since the last source is only part of a larger incident, the Gemara cites <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. In the time of Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas</b> the Sages <b>permitted the rival wife of a daughter to the brothers.</b> In other words, it became known that Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas deemed permitted a daughter’s rival wife. <b>And this matter was difficult</b> in the eyes of <b>the Rabbis because he was a great Sage</b> and his decision in favor of Beit Shammai carried great weight. They could not approach him immediately, as he was very old <b>and his eyes had dimmed</b> so much that he was incapable <b>of coming to the study hall.</b>",
    "They <b>said: And who will go and notify him</b> that this matter requires clarification? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: I will go.</b> They asked: <b>And who</b> shall go <b>after him?</b> They selected <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya,</b> who was one of the great Sages of the generation, notwithstanding his youth. They further inquired: <b>And who after him? Rabbi Akiva. They went and stood at the entrance of</b> Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas’s <b>house. His maidservant entered</b> and <b>said to him: Rabbi, the Sages of Israel have come to you. He said to her: Let them enter, and they entered.</b>",
    "Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas <b>grabbed Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> with whom he was already acquainted, <b>and sat him on a bed of gold,</b> as Rabbi Dosa was extremely wealthy. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Rabbi, call your other disciple</b> so <b>that he may sit.</b> He asked him to call the other Sage as well, as it is a mark of respect when speaking to a great scholar to call every other Sage his disciple. <b>He said to him: Who is it?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua replied: <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.</b> Rabbi Dosa <b>said: And does our colleague Azarya have a son?</b> Due to his old age and prolonged absence from the study hall he had not heard of him.",
    "Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas <b>recited this verse about</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya: <b>“I have been young, and now am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread”</b> (Psalms 37:25). He interpreted this verse to mean that the son of a Torah scholar also becomes a Torah scholar. <b>He grabbed him and sat him on a bed of gold.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Rabbi, call your other disciple</b> so <b>that he may sit. He said to him: Who is that?</b> He said to him: <b>Akiva ben Yosef.</b> Rabbi Dosa <b>said to him: You are Akiva ben Yosef, whose name has spread from one end of the world to the other?</b> Even Rabbi Dosa had heard of Rabbi Akiva’s reputation as a great man. <b>Sit, my son, sit. May the likes of you multiply in Israel.</b>",
    "Out of courtesy, they did not wish to broach the subject immediately. Rather, <b>they began to encircle him with</b> deliberations on different <b><i>halakhot</i>, until they came to</b> the case of the <b>rival wife of a daughter. They said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>rival wife of a daughter? He said</b> that it is a matter of <b>dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.</b> They asked him: <b>According to whose statement is the <i>halakha</i>? He said to them: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel. They said to him: But didn’t they say in your name that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai?</b>",
    "<b>He said to them: Did you hear</b> that <b>Dosa</b> ben Harkinas issued this ruling, <b>or did you hear</b> that it was stated by <b>ben Harkinas? They said to him: On your life, Rabbi, we heard simply</b> ben Harkinas. <b>He said to them:</b> If so, it is no wonder, as <b>I have a younger brother who is the firstborn of the Satan,</b> i.e., he is extremely sharp and as brazen as a demon. <b>And his name is Yonatan, and he is among the disciples of Shammai.</b> It is he who issued this ruling.",
    "Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas added: <b>And beware that he not batter you with <i>halakhot</i></b> in this matter, <b>as he has with him three hundred proofs with regard to</b> the <b>rival wife of a daughter that she is permitted. However,</b> you need not worry about the issue itself, as <b>I call as witnesses before me the heavens and the earth that on this</b> very <b>mortar,</b> which was preserved in my house due to its historical importance, <b>Haggai the prophet sat, and</b> I have a tradition that <b>he said three matters</b> of <i>halakha</i>: First, that the <b>rival wife of a daughter is forbidden.</b>",
    "Second, that the halakhic rulings for the territories of <b>Ammon and Moab</b> in Transjordan, although similar to those of Eretz Yisrael, are not exactly the same, as their residents <b>tithe the poor man’s tithe in the Sabbatical Year.</b> The total abandonment of fields in the seventh year does not apply in Ammon and Moab, as they are not part of Eretz Yisrael. Instead, in those areas one must bring the poor man’s tithe to the paupers of Eretz Yisrael, as there are no tithes in Eretz Yisrael in the Sabbatical Year. Lastly, Haggai testified: <b>And one accepts converts from the Karduyin and the Tarmodim,</b> without concern that there might be Jews mingled among them, which could render them <i>mamzerim</i> and prohibited from entering the community.",
    "The Sage <b>taught: When they entered, they</b> all <b>entered through one entrance. When they left, they left through three entrances,</b> in an effort to try to find Rabbi Dosa’s brother. <b>Rabbi Akiva encountered him.</b> Yonatan ben Harkinas <b>raised against him</b> all of his <b>objections</b> to the opinion of Beit Hillel, <b>and he withstood him,</b> i.e., Rabbi Akiva was able to respond to all of them.",
    "Yonatan ben Harkinas grew angry and <b>said to him: You are Akiva ben Yosef, whose name has spread from one end of the world to the other? Be happy that you have merited a</b> great <b>name, and</b> yet <b>you have not yet reached</b> the level <b>of cattle herders.</b> Cattle herders were generally simple individuals who were not familiar even with ordinary matters, and certainly not with <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him</b> with characteristic modesty: <b>And</b> I have not <b>even</b> reached the level <b>of shepherds,</b> who are considered even worse than cattle herders, as they are unfit for giving testimony.",
    "§ Since the <i>halakhot</i> of the prophet Haggai were mentioned, the Gemara discusses them here. Haggai said that <b>Ammon and Moab tithe the poor man’s tithe in the Sabbatical Year, as the Master said: Many cities were conquered by those who returned from Egypt, and were not conquered by those who returned from Babylonia</b> after the destruction of the First Temple. <b>And the initial consecration</b> of Eretz Yisrael, by those who returned from Egypt, <b>sanctified it for its time and did not sanctify it forever,</b> as the future sanctification of Eretz Yisrael depended on the renewed conquest of the land by the Jewish people.",
    "<b>And</b> those who returned from Babylonia <b>left those</b> places aside and did not consider them part of Eretz Yisrael even after Jewish settlement was renewed there. They would plow and harvest in these places in the Sabbatical Year and tithe the poor man’s tithe <b>so that the poor</b> of Eretz Yisrael who did not have sufficient income from the previous years <b>could rely upon them.</b> Consequently, <b>in the Sabbatical Year</b> the poor received help from this tithe.",
    "§ Haggai also declared: <b>And one accepts converts from the Karduyim and the Tarmodim.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rami bar Yeḥezkel teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not accept converts from the Karduyim? Rav Ashi said: Kartuyim,</b> not Karduyim, <b>was stated</b> by Rami bar Yeḥezkel. <b>As people say</b> in common discourse: <b>The Kartuyim are unfit.</b>",
    "<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a slightly different version of this discussion. <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught: One does not accept converts from the Kartuyim. What, is it not</b> the case that <b>Kartuyim is</b> the same as <b>Karduyim?</b> If so there is a contradiction between the <i>baraita</i> of Rami bar Yeḥezkel and the statement of Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas. <b>Rav Ashi said: No; the Kartuyim are</b> one <b>discrete</b> category <b>and the Karduyim are</b> another <b>discrete</b> category, <b>as people say: Kartuyim are unfit.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and the Elders both say: One does not accept converts from the Tarmodim.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that one does not accept converts from the Tarmodim due to a concern that Jews may have intermingled with them? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: <b>All</b> clothing with <b>stains</b> of blood that might be from a menstruating woman and <b>that come from the</b> city on the border of Eretz Yisrael called <b>Rekem are ritually pure,</b> as it can be assumed that they belong to gentiles, and the blood of a menstruating gentile woman is not ritually impure.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> it <b>ritually impure because those</b> residents of that place <b>are converts and are in error.</b> In other words, some of the inhabitants of Rekem assimilated and no longer observe the <i>halakhot</i> of the Torah, and therefore one must be wary lest the stains are in fact from a Jewish menstruating woman. Stains that came <b>from among the gentiles,</b> however, <b>are ritually pure. And we discussed</b> the following problem:"
