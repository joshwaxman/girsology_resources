    "<b>and from your</b> own <b>they shall give you.</b> Everyone has a portion designated for him by God, and the individual is privileged to receive what is coming to him, as was the case with the House of Avtinas. The principle is: <b>No person</b> may <b>touch</b> that <b>which is prepared for another</b> by God; everyone receives what is designated for him. <b>And one reign does not overlap with another</b> and deduct from the time allotted it <b>even a hairbreadth.</b> When the time comes for one kingdom to fall, its successor takes over immediately, as no king rules during the time designated for another.",
    "§ The mishna related that <b>Hugras ben Levi</b> knew a lesson in the art of music and he did not want to teach it to others. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> Hugras ben Levi <b>projects his voice in</b> a sweet <b>melody,</b> he <b>places his thumb into his mouth and places his finger between the strings</b> of a lyre and sings. This produced a sound <b>so</b> sweet <b>that his brethren the priests were abruptly taken aback.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught: Ben Kamtzar did not want to teach</b> others a special <b>technique of writing.</b> What was that technique? <b>They said about him that he would take four quills between his fingers, and if there was a word</b> consisting <b>of four letters</b> that he wanted to write, <b>he could write it simultaneously. They said to him: What did you see that</b> led you <b>not to teach</b> that technique? <b>All the</b> others with unique skills <b>came up</b> with <b>a response to</b> questions about the <b>matter</b> of <b>their</b> conduct, claiming that they sought to prevent their technique from being used in idol worship. However, <b>ben Kamtzar did not come up</b> with <b>a response to</b> questions about the <b>matter</b> of <b>his</b> conduct, and it was clear that his only motivation in preventing his skill from being disseminated was his own personal honor. <b>With regard to the first</b> people listed, <b>it is stated: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing”</b> (Proverbs 10:7); <b>and about ben Kamtzar and his counterparts it is stated: “But the name of the wicked shall rot”</b> (Proverbs 10:7).",
    "§ Apropos the verse cited, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>But the name of the wicked shall rot?</b> How does a name rot? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> It means that <b>decay will spread on their names,</b> meaning <b>that we do not call</b> others <b>by their names,</b> and the name will sink into oblivion. <b>Ravina raised an objection</b> from an incident that transpired during the Second Temple era. There was <b>an incident involving Doeg ben Yosef, whose father</b> died and <b>left him</b> as <b>a young child to his mother,</b> who loved him. <b>Each day his mother measured</b> his height <b>in handbreadths and donated</b> a measure of <b>gold</b> equivalent to <b>the weight</b> that <b>he</b> gained <b>to the Temple.</b> Later, when the <b>enemy prevailed</b> and there was a terrible famine in the city, <b>she slaughtered and ate him.</b>",
    "<b>And with regard to her</b> and others like her <b>Jeremiah lamented: “Shall the women eat their fruit, their children in their care [<i>tipuḥim</i>]?”</b> (Lamentations 2:20). The Gemara interprets the term <i>tipuḥim</i> homiletically as referring to this baby, who was measured in handbreadths [<i>tefaḥim</i>]. Even he was eaten by his mother. <b>And the Divine Spirit responds and says:</b> Why did this happen? <b>“Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the Temple of the Lord?”</b> (Lamentations 2:20). It is punishment for the murder of the priest Zechariah ben Jehoiada. This incident involves a boy named Doeg; even though the person with that name was wicked (see I Samuel, chapter 22), the boy was named for him. The Gemara responds: <b>See what befell him.</b> Clearly, his name was a bad omen.",
    "<b>Rabbi Elazar said: A righteous person</b> is praised <b>for his own</b> actions, <b>and a wicked person</b> is cursed not only for his own actions but also for the actions <b>of his</b> wicked <b>counterpart. A righteous person</b> is praised <b>for his actions, as it is written: “The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing”;</b> righteous is written in the singular. <b>A wicked person</b> is also cursed for the actions <b>of his</b> wicked <b>counterpart, as it is written: “But the name of the wicked shall rot”;</b> wicked is written in the plural. Once one wicked person is mentioned, his wicked counterparts are cursed as well.",
    "<b>Ravina said to one of the Sages who would organize aggadic</b> statements <b>before him: From where is this matter that the Sages stated: The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing,</b> derived?<b> He said to him: As it is written</b> explicitly in the book of Proverbs: <b>“The memory of the righteous shall be for a blessing.”</b> He then asked him: <b>From where in the Torah do we</b> derive this? He said to him: <b>As it is written: “And God said: Shall I hide from Abraham that which I am doing?”</b> (Genesis 18:17). <b>And</b> as soon as Abraham’s name is mentioned, <b>it is written: “And Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation”</b> (Genesis 18:18), although there is no clear connection to the previous verse. Apparently, once the name of a righteous person is mentioned, it is followed directly by praise of the individual. That is the Torah source for the statement that the mention of the righteous is for blessing.",
    "Then he asked: <b>From where is this matter that the Sages said: But the name of the wicked shall rot,</b> derived? <b>He said to him: As it is written</b> explicitly in the book of Proverbs: <b>“But the name of the wicked shall rot.”</b> He then asked him: <b>From where in the Torah do we</b> derive this? He said to him: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to Lot: <b>“And he moved his tent as far as Sodom”</b> (Genesis 13:12). <b>And</b> as soon as Sodom is mentioned, <b>it is written: “And the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinful to God”</b> (Genesis 13:13).",
    "Apropos these statements, the Gemara cites another statement that <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> There was <b>a righteous person</b> who <b>lived between two wicked people and did not learn from their actions;</b> there was <b>a wicked person</b> who <b>lived between two righteous people and did not learn from their actions.</b> How so? <b>A righteous person lived between two wicked people and did not learn from their actions</b> is <b>Obadiah,</b> who was a minister for Ahab and Jezebel and nevertheless remained God-fearing (see I Kings, chapter 18). <b>A wicked person who lived between two righteous people and did not learn from their actions is Esau,</b> who was born and raised in the house of Isaac and Rebecca and nevertheless remained wicked.",
    "§ <b>Rabbi Elazar said: From the blessing of the righteous you infer a curse for the wicked; and</b> conversely, <b>from the curse of the wicked you infer a blessing for the righteous.</b> How so? <b>From the blessing of the righteous you infer a curse for the wicked, as it is written</b> with regard to Abraham: <b>“For I have known him to the end that he will command</b> his children and his household after him” (Genesis 18:19), <b>and it is written thereafter: “The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is very great”</b> (Genesis 18:20). The righteousness of Abraham underscores the relative wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, exacerbating their punishment.",
    "Conversely, <b>from the curse of the wicked you infer a blessing for the righteous, as it is written: “And the men of Sodom were</b> exceedingly <b>wicked and sinful to God”</b> (Genesis 13:13), after which it is written: <b>“And God said to Abram, after that Lot had separated from him”</b> (Genesis 13:14); God proceeds to bless him. And <b>Rabbi Elazar said: Even for one righteous</b> person an entire <b>world is created, as it is stated: “And God saw the light, that it was good”</b> (Genesis 1:4), <b>and good means nothing other than righteous, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous that he is good”</b> (Isaiah 3:10).",
    "<b>Rabbi Elazar</b> further <b>said: One who causes himself to forget a matter of his studies</b> ultimately <b>causes exile for his children, as it is stated: “Because you have forgotten the Torah of your God, I will also forget your children”</b> (Hosea 4:6). <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> With regard to he who causes his studies to be forgotten, <b>one reduces him from his prominence, as it is stated: “Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you; you shall not serve Me”</b> (Hosea 4:6).",
    "Apropos the righteous, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: No righteous person departs from this world until another comparable righteous person is created, as it is stated: “And the sun rises and the sun sets”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:5); before the sun sets the new sun has already risen. <b>Before the sun of Eli was extinguished, the sun of Samuel of Ramah</b> had already <b>shone</b> (see I Samuel, chapter 3), and so on throughout the generations. And <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, saw that righteous people were few,</b> so <b>He arose and planted</b> some of <b>them in each and every generation</b> to ensure the presence of at least one righteous person in each generation. <b>As it is stated: “For the pillars of the earth are the Lord’s, and He has set the world upon them”</b> (I Samuel 2:8). Since the world rests upon the righteous, each generation requires the presence of a righteous person to provide that support.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even for one righteous person the world exists, as it is stated: “But the righteous is the foundation of the world”</b> (Proverbs 10:25). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya himself said:</b> The proof is <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“He will keep the feet of His pious ones”</b> (I Samuel 2:9), meaning that God maintains the world due to the pious people. The Gemara questions this proof; <b>“pious ones” indicates many</b> rather than a single righteous person. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Although the text is vocalized in the plural, it <b>is written</b> in the singular: “<b>His pious one”;</b> God maintains the world even for a single pious individual.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Once most of a person’s years have passed and he did not sin, he will never sin, as it is stated: “He will keep the feet of His pious ones”</b> (I Samuel 2:9). Once a person has established himself as righteous, God will keep him from failing thereafter. In <b>the school of Rabbi Sheila they say: Once</b> the opportunity to perform <b>a sinful act presents itself</b> to a person <b>a first time and a second, and he does not sin, he will never sin, as it is stated: “He will keep the feet of His pious ones”</b> (I Samuel 2:9). Once he has refrained from sin several times, he has established himself as pious and God will protect him thereafter.",
    "<b>Reish Lakish said: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “If it concerns the scorners, He scorns them, but to the humble He gives grace”</b> (Proverbs 3:34)? If one <b>comes to impurify, they open</b> before him the opportunity to exercise his free will and do as he pleases. If one <b>comes to purify, they assist him.</b> In <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael it was taught</b> with regard to this verse: This is <b>comparable to</b> the case of <b>a man who was selling</b> both crude <b>naphtha [<i>neft</i>],</b> whose odor is vile, and <b>balsam,</b> whose fragrance is pleasant."
