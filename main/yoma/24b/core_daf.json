    "<b>“To that within the veil; and you shall serve;</b> I give you the priesthood as a service of gift” (Numbers 18:7), indicating that it is only with regard to services that are performed <b>within the veil,</b> i.e., in the Holy of Holies, <b>that there is</b> a distinction between services, and a non-priest who performs <b>services of giving</b> there, such as sprinkling the blood inside the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, is subject to the death penalty, <b>but not</b> one who performs <b>services of removing</b> there, such as the removal of the censer from the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur. <b>This</b> leads to the conclusion that when it comes to services performed <b>outside</b> of the Holy of Holies, a non-priest would be liable if he performed any service, <b>even a service of removal,</b> such as the removal of ashes from the altar.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the limitations of the verse apply only to those services performed in the Holy of Holies, one should say that the phrase: “<b>And you shall serve [<i>va’avadtem</i>],”</b> from which it is derived that one is liable only for a service that is complete [<i>avoda tamma</i>] on its own and not incomplete, should <b>also</b> be similarly limited to services performed <b>to what is within the veil.</b> In that case, the liability of the non-priest, which is limited to cases where he performs <b>a complete service and</b> does <b>not</b> apply if he performs <b>a service that</b> is only preparatory and <b>has another service after it</b> that completes its purpose, should apply only to services performed in the Holy of Holies. <b>But</b> for services performed <b>outside</b> the Holy of Holies, a non-priest should be liable <b>even</b> if it is <b>a service that</b> is incomplete and <b>has a service after it.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: The phrase: “<b>And you shall serve [<i>va’avadtem</i>],”</b> which begins with the conjunction <i>vav</i>, meaning: And, indicates that <b>the verse goes back and combines</b> the service performed within the veil to services performed outside of it. This teaches that with regard to this <i>halakha</i> there is no difference between a service performed outside and a service performed inside.",
    "According to Levi, if a non-priest performs a service involving removal within the veil, i.e., in the Holy of Holies, he does not incur the death penalty, but if he performs a service involving removal outside, such as the removal of the ashes from the external altar, he is liable to the death penalty. <b>Rava raised a dilemma</b> relating to Levi’s approach: <b>What</b> would be the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a service of removal</b> performed <b>in the Sanctuary</b> chamber that is before the Holy of Holies, such as removing the burnt incense from the inner altar, or removing burnt wicks and leftover oil from the candelabrum? Do <b>we compare</b> such an act <b>to</b> a service performed <b>inside</b> the Holy of Holies, so that he would be exempt from the death penalty, <b>or</b> do <b>we compare</b> it <b>to the outer</b> service?",
    "Rava himself <b>went back and resolved</b> the dilemma: Had the Torah said only: <b>Within</b> the veil, it would have been understood that it is referring only to actions performed in the Holy of Holies. But since the Torah says: <b>And to what is within</b> the veil, the added conjunction: And, teaches that it is referring to something else besides the Holy of Holies, i.e., the Sanctuary.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>However, if</b> it is <b>so</b> that a non-priest is liable for performing a service that is complete on its own that takes place in the Sanctuary, one should say that <b>a non-priest who arranges the</b> loaves on the shewbread <b>table should be liable.</b> The Gemara answers: After arranging the bread <b>there is</b> still the <b>arranging of the vessels</b> of frankincense on the table that remains to be done, so the arrangement of the bread is not a service that is complete on its own. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>a non-priest who arranges the vessels</b> of frankincense on the table <b>should be liable.</b> The Gemara rejects this: After arranging the vessels, <b>there is</b> still the <b>removal</b> of these vessels <b>and the burning</b> of their frankincense on the altar that remain to be done; therefore, arranging the vessels is not considered a service that is complete on its own.",
    "The Gemara asks further with regard to the notion that a non-priest is liable for performing a service that is complete on its own that takes place in the Sanctuary: If so, <b>a non-priest who arranges the</b> lamps of the <b>candelabrum should be liable.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>There is</b> still the <b>placing of the wicks</b> in the lamps that remains to be done, so arranging the lamps is not considered a service that is complete on its own. The Gemara asks: If so, a non-priest who <b>placed a wick</b> in the candelabrum’s lamps <b>should be liable.</b> The Gemara answers: That too is not a service that is complete on its own, as <b>there is</b> still the necessity of <b>placing the oil.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: If so, a non-priest who <b>placed the oil should be liable.</b> The Gemara answers: That too is not a service that is complete on its own, as <b>there is</b> still the service of <b>lighting</b> that needs to be done. The Gemara asks: If so, if a non-priest <b>who lit</b> the lamps <b>should be liable.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lighting</b> the lamps <b>is not</b> considered a bona fide Temple <b>service,</b> since in doing so nothing is done to the candelabrum itself.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> kindling a fire really <b>not</b> considered a Temple service? <b>But wasn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: <b>“And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar and lay out wood in order upon the fire”</b> (Leviticus 1:7), which <b>teaches that the kindling of chips [<i>alita</i>]</b> added to keep the altar’s fire going must <b>be performed only by a proper priest and</b> that he must be wearing <b>the priestly garments?</b> This shows that kindling is considered a service. The Gemara answers: <b>Kindling</b> the <b>chips is a</b> bona fide <b>service,</b> but <b>lighting</b> the candelabrum is <b>not</b> a bona fide <b>service.</b>",
    "The Gemara further asks: <b>However, if</b> it is <b>so</b> that a non-priest is liable for performing any service involving placing, as established above, <b>a non-priest who set up the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar <b>should be liable,</b> since that is a service involving placing. The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> still <b>the</b> mitzva of the <b>arrangement of two logs</b> on the altar that remains to be done, so that setting up the arrangement of wood is not a service that is complete on its own. The Gemara asks: If so, a non-priest who <b>arranged the two logs should be liable.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> still <b>the arrangement of limbs</b> of offerings on the fire that remains to be done, so placing the two logs is also not considered a service that is complete on its own.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Asi say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A non-priest who arranged the two pieces of wood is liable?</b> This shows that placing the two logs is a complete service and contradicts Rav’s statement that a non-priest is liable only if he performs the four services that he mentioned above. The Gemara answers: Indeed, Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree on this</b> point. <b>One Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that the placement of the two logs <b>is a service that is complete</b> on its own, as the arrangement of limbs that follows is not considered a continuation of the setting up of the wood; <b>and one Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that the placement of the two logs <b>is not</b> considered <b>a service that is complete</b> on its own, since it is followed by the arrangement of the limbs on the wood.",
    "The Gemara returns to the disagreement between Rav and Levi and notes: <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> and <b>it was taught</b> in a second <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Levi. It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav:</b> These are the <b>services for which a non-priest</b> who performs them <b>is liable to</b> receive the penalty of <b>death</b> by God’s hand: One who performs <b>the sprinkling of blood, whether inside</b> the Sanctuary; on the golden altar or at the veil; <b>or inside the innermost</b> chamber, the Holy of Holies, on Yom Kippur; or outside on the main altar; <b>and one who sprinkles</b> blood in the case of a <b>bird sin-offering; and one who squeezes</b> the blood of <b>a bird burnt-offering</b> on the wall of the altar <b>or burns</b> the bird on the altar; <b>and one who pours out three <i>log</i> of water</b> on the altar for the <i>Sukkot</i> water libation <b>or three <i>log</i> of wine</b> on the altar for an ordinary libation. The removal of ashes from the altar is not listed here.",
    "<b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Levi:</b> These are the <b>services for which a non-priest</b> who performs them <b>is liable to</b> receive the penalty of <b>death</b> by God’s hand: <b>One who removes the ashes</b> from the altar; one who performs <b>the seven sprinklings that are</b> performed <b>inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>or</b> the sprinklings <b>of the leper; and one who raises up</b> an offering <b>onto the altar, whether it is</b> a <b>proper</b> offering <b>or</b> a <b>disqualified</b> one. In this <i>baraita</i>, the removal of ashes is listed.",
    "§ The Gemara returns to its interpretation of the mishna. The mishna states that there were four lotteries held in the Temple every day. One of the Sages asked: <b>Why did</b> the Temple authorities <b>hold lotteries?</b> Before answering the question, the Gemara expresses astonishment at the question itself: <b>Why did they hold lotteries?</b> The reason is <b>as we said</b> clearly in the mishna: To prevent quarrels among the priests. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> this is the meaning of the question: <b>Why did they</b> assemble all the priests together and <b>hold a lottery, and once again</b> gather them together to <b>hold another lottery,</b> four times, when the priests could be gathered one time and all the necessary lotteries held at that time?",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It was done this way <b>in order to create a commotion throughout</b> the Temple <b>courtyard,</b> as the priests would converge from all over to assemble there, <b>as it is stated: “We took sweet counsel together, in the House of God we walked with the throng”</b> (Psalms 55:15). This verse teaches that it is proper to stir up a commotion and to cause public excitement in the course of the Temple services and the preliminary steps leading up to them, such as the assignment of tasks to the priests.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> garments were the priests clothed when <b>they held the lottery? Rav Naḥman said:</b> The priests were clothed in their own <b>non-sacred garments. And Rav Sheshet said:</b> The priests were dressed in the priestly <b>sacred garments.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains the two approaches. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The priests were dressed in <b>non-sacred garments, because if you say</b> the lottery was to be held when they were dressed in their <b>sacred garments, there are</b> strong-<b>armed men who might act with force and perform the service</b> even if they did not win the lottery. Since they were already wearing the sacred garments, they would simply force their way into performing the service. <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> They were wearing the <b>sacred garments, as, if you say</b> they wore their <b>non-sacred garments, due to</b> the fact that the service was so <b>beloved</b> to them, in their excitement over having been granted the privilege to perform the service, <b>it may happen</b> that <b>they would perform the service</b> immediately, forgetting to don their sacred garments, thereby disqualifying the service.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman said: From where do I state</b> my opinion? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna: After the lottery <b>they gave</b> the priests <b>over to the attendants, and they would take their clothes off them and they would leave only</b> their <b>trousers on them.</b>"
