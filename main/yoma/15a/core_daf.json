    "It means: <b>At the time of</b> the <b>removal</b> of the ashes <b>you shall burn the incense,</b> and no later. <b>As, if you do not say so</b> but explain that the phrase: He shall burn the incense, at the end of the verse means after cleaning the lamps, then with regard to the burning of the <b>afternoon</b> incense, with regard to <b>which it is written: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it”</b> (Exodus 30:8), in <b>this</b> case <b>too,</b> does it mean that <b>initially</b> the priest <b>lights the lamps and</b> only <b>then burns the afternoon incense? And if you say indeed,</b> that is <b>so, wasn’t</b> the following <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Aaron and his sons will set it in order to burn <b>from evening until morning</b> before the Lord; it shall be a statute forever throughout their generations on behalf of the children of Israel” (Exodus 27:21)?",
    "And the <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Give</b> the candelabrum <b>its measure</b> of oil so that <b>it will continue to burn all night from evening until morning. Alternatively,</b> the phrase: <b>From evening to morning,</b> teaches that <b>you have only this service that is valid</b> when performed <b>from evening to morning</b>. Apparently, lighting the candelabrum is the final daily Temple service and the incense is not burned after the lamps are lit. <b>Rather, what is the Merciful One saying</b> in the phrase: “And when Aaron lights the lamps in the afternoon he shall burn it.” This teaches that <b>at the time of</b> the <b>lighting</b> of the lamps <b>you shall burn the incense,</b> and no later. If so, <b>here too,</b> in the morning, <b>at the time of</b> the <b>removal</b> of the ashes <b>you shall burn the incense,</b> and no later. This is the rationale for the opinion of the Rabbis.",
    "<b>And Abba Shaul</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>It is different there,</b> with regard to the burning of the afternoon incense, <b>as it is written:</b> “Aaron and his sons will set <b>it</b> [<b><i>oto</i></b>] in order.” The term <i>oto</i> is exclusionary: Only in the afternoon is it critical that the lighting of the lamps be the last service performed and that it follow the burning of the incense. However, in the morning, where there is no exclusionary term, the sequence of the verse is observed: First attending to the candelabrum and then burning the incense.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said</b> a different resolution to the contradiction between the <i>mishnayot.</i> This is <b>not difficult,</b> because each mishna is in accordance with the opinion of a different <i>tanna</i>. <b>This</b> mishna, in which the burning of the incense is first, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis;</b> and <b>that</b> mishna, in which the lighting of the lamps is first, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul.</b> The Gemara questions Rav Pappa’s resolution: In accordance with the opinion of <b>which</b> <i>tanna</i> <b>is the mishna here established?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The sequence in the mishna where the <b>lottery</b> is discussed is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul.</b>",
    "<b>Say the latter clause</b> of that mishna as follows: <b>They brought him the</b> sheep for <b>the daily</b> morning <b>offering that he slaughtered</b> by cutting most of the way through the gullet and the windpipe. <b>And</b> a <b>different</b> priest <b>completed</b> the <b>slaughter on his behalf.</b> And then <b>he entered</b> the Sanctuary <b>to burn the</b> morning <b>incense and to remove</b> the ashes from <b>the lamps</b> of the candelabrum. If so, <b>we have</b> again <b>arrived at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that burning the incense precedes attending to the lamps, which leads to the difficult conclusion: The <b>first clause and</b> the <b>last clause</b> of the mishna in tractate <i>Yoma</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and the <b>middle clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul. Rav Pappa</b> could have <b>said to you: Indeed,</b> the <b>first clause and</b> the <b>last clause</b> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and the <b>middle clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul.</b> Although this is not common, because these <i>mishnayot</i> are not directly juxtaposed, it is possible.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Abaye does not say in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa,</b> as he is <b>not</b> willing to <b>establish</b> the <b>first clause and</b> the <b>last clause</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> and the <b>middle clause</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abba Shaul. However,</b> with regard to <b>Rav Pappa, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Abaye</b> and instead prefers an uncommon and difficult resolution? Rav Pappa could have <b>said to you</b> that the resolution proposed by Abaye is difficult as well, as according to Abaye <b>in the first clause</b> of the mishna it was <b>taught</b> with regard to the <b>removal</b> of the ashes from <b>two lamps,</b> which is performed later, <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> taught the <b>removal</b> of the ashes from <b>five lamps,</b> which is performed before the ashes of the two lamps are cleared. Therefore, Rav Pappa prefers to establish that the <i>mishnayot</i> reflect a tannaitic dispute rather than to accept this reversal of the order.",
    "<b>And Abaye</b> holds that this is not difficult and could have <b>said to you</b> that the first mishna, which describes the routine of the High Priest during his seven days of separation, teaches <b>a general directive</b> describing the services with which the High Priest must be familiarized prior to Yom Kippur, without concern for the sequence. <b>And</b> in terms of <b>the sequence, the</b> mishna <b>then teaches</b> it in the context of the actual performance of the services.",
    "§ The Gemara cites a dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa. The Gemara proceeds to analyze <b>the matter itself:</b> The priest <b>comes to the northeast corner</b> of the altar and <b>sprinkles</b> once on the <b>northeast</b> corner. From there he proceeds to the <b>southwest corner</b> and <b>sprinkles</b> once on the <b>southwest</b> corner. <b>And it was taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>concerning</b> this mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa changes the</b> sprinkling of the blood of the <b>daily offering</b> vis-à-vis the sprinkling of blood of all other burnt-offerings. The priest comes to the <b>northeast</b> corner and <b>sprinkles</b> once on the <b>northeast</b> corner. However, when he proceeds to the <b>southwest</b> corner, <b>he sprinkles</b> on the <b>west</b> side of the altar <b>and then sprinkles</b> on the <b>south</b> side. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the rationale</b> for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa,</b> who changes the sprinkling of the blood of the daily offering vis-à-vis the sprinkling of blood of all other burnt-offerings?",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of one</b> of the Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai</b> that <b>the verse states: “And one goat as a sin-offering to the Lord; it shall be offered aside from the daily burnt-offering and its libation”</b> (Numbers 28:15). From the phrase: Beside the daily burnt-offering, it is derived that the daily offering is <b>a burnt-offering</b>, and from the juxtaposition of the sacrifice of the sin-offering to the daily offering, <b>the Merciful One said: Perform with it the procedure of a sin-offering.</b>",
    "And <b>how</b> can <b>this</b> be accomplished? It can be accomplished by performing half of the sprinklings according to the procedure of a burnt-offering, and half according to the procedure of a sin-offering. One <b>sprinkles one</b> sprinkling <b>that is two,</b> i.e., one sprinkles the blood on the corner of the altar so that the blood is divided between the two sides, <b>in accordance with the procedure of a</b> standard <b>burnt-offering.</b> Then <b>he sprinkles two</b> sprinklings <b>that are two, in accordance with the procedure of a sin-offering.</b> The blood of a sin-offering is sprinkled in four separate actions, one on each of the four corners of the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if the objective is to have the daily offering sacrificed like a sin-offering, <b>let him sprinkle</b> the blood in a manner that will accomplish both: First, <b>two</b> sprinklings <b>that are four in accordance with the procedure of a</b> standard <b>burnt-offering, and</b> then <b>four</b> sprinklings <b>that are four in accordance with the procedure of a sin-offering.</b>",
    "The Gemara rejects that proposal: <b>We did not find</b> a case of <b>blood that atones and</b> then <b>again atones.</b> Once the blood was sprinkled and brought atonement by following the procedure of the burnt-offering, one cannot then begin the rite of atonement of a sin-offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And did we find</b> the <b>blood</b> of an offering, <b>half of which</b> is sprinkled as <b>a sin-offering and half of which</b> is sprinkled as <b>a burnt-offering? Rather, perforce,</b> say that <b>the verse juxtaposes them</b> and commands that the blood of the daily offering be offered half as a burnt-offering and half as a sin-offering. <b>Here too, perforce,</b> say that <b>the verse juxtaposes them</b> and commands two separate sprinklings: The sprinkling of a burnt-offering followed by the sprinkling of a sin-offering.",
    "The Gemara responds: The two suggestions are different. <b>There,</b> in the statement of Rabbi Shimon Ish HaMitzpa, there is no radical divergence from the standard burnt-offering; <b>it is merely dividing the sprinklings.</b> Instead of sprinkling the blood on the corner so that it falls on two sides of the altar, one sprinkles the blood on each of the two sides separately. In contrast, performing two independent acts of sprinkling is a radical divergence. <b>And</b> the Gemara suggests an alternative manner in which the daily offering could be offered like a sin-offering. <b>Let us sprinkle one</b> sprinkling <b>that is two below</b> the red line painted halfway up the altar, <b>in accordance with the procedure of a</b> standard <b>burnt-offering,</b> and sprinkle another <b>two sprinklings that are two above</b> the red line on the upper half of the altar <b>in accordance with the procedure of a sin-offering</b>.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>We did not find</b> a case of <b>blood half of which</b> is sprinkled <b>above</b> the red line <b>and half of which</b> is sprinkled <b>below</b> the red line. One either sprinkles all the blood on the lower half of the altar, as in the case of most offerings, or entirely on the upper half of the altar, as in the case of sin-offerings. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> case of that sort? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna: The High Priest took the blood of the bull into the Holy of Holies <b>and sprinkled from</b> the blood <b>one</b> time <b>upward and</b> then <b>seven</b> times <b>downward?</b> Apparently, the blood of an offering can be sprinkled part upward, toward the upper part of the thickness of the Ark cover, and part downward, toward the lower part of the thickness of the Ark cover.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: That is not a case of half the blood sprinkled upward and half sprinkled downward. Instead, that sprinkling was <b>like a <i>matzlif</i>;</b> the sprinklings were not performed one above the other, but rather one beneath the other, and all were sprinkled in a row on the Ark cover. The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>like a <i>matzlif</i>? Rav Yehuda demonstrated</b> with his hand; it means <b>like one who whips.</b> One who whips another does not strike in one place but directs one lash beneath another.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there really <b>no</b> case of that sort? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna with regard to the sprinkling of blood on the incense altar: <b>He sprinkled seven times from</b> the blood <b>on <i>tohoro</i> of the altar. What, is it not</b> referring to the <b>middle</b> of the side <b>of the altar, as people say: Clear noon [<i>tihara</i>],</b> that <b>is the middle of the day?</b> In other words, <i>tohoro</i> refers to halfway up the altar. Now, since the blood was sprinkled on the altar seven times, inevitably some of the blood landed above the midpoint and some of it landed below the midpoint.",
    "<b>Rabba bar Sheila said: No</b>, that is not the meaning of <i>tohoro</i>."
