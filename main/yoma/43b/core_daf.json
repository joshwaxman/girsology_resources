    "<b>And Rabbi Yehuda does not disagree.</b> The mishna implies that even he agrees with the mishna’s ruling.",
    "<b>Abaye said: Since the Master,</b> i.e., Ulla, <b>said:</b> In some stages, the conditions <b>implied</b> by the phrasing of the verse <b>precludes</b> the application of conditions that are <b>implied</b> by a previous verse describing a previous stage, whereas in other stages, the conditions <b>implied</b> by the phrasing of the verse stand <b>on their own</b> and also apply in subsequent stages. Since it is clear from the opinion of the Rabbis that the verse describing the taking and dipping of hyssop is to be understood as indicating a change of conditions, perforce Rabbi Yehuda must also assume that there is a change in conditions, as explained above. Therefore, he certainly <b>disagrees</b> with the mishna’s ruling, even though his dissenting opinion is not recorded in the mishna.",
    "The Gemara expounds the next verse: <b>“And the pure one shall sprinkle upon the impure”</b> (Numbers 19:19). The previous verse already states that the one who sprinkles must be ritually pure. This requirement is repeated here to make the following inference: He is <b>pure,</b> which <b>by inference</b> suggests that initially <b>he was ritually impure</b> and has now removed that impurity. This fact is significant only if the reference is to a person who has still not completed his purification process. As such, the repetition of the requirement that the one who sprinkles be pure <b>teaches about one who immersed that day, that he is qualified</b> to sprinkle the waters <b>in</b> the rite of the red <b>heifer.</b> This is one who was rendered ritually impure with a type of ritual impurity from which he will become fully ritually pure only upon nightfall.",
    "<b>Rabbi Asi said: When Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish analyzed</b> the passage <b>of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> to try to identify a consistent pattern in the way the implied conditions should be understood, i.e., when they exist to preclude conditions implied in previous stages, and when they imply conditions that remain in force in subsequent stages. <b>They brought up from it only as the amount</b> of earth <b>that the fox brings up from a plowed field,</b> meaning that they reached few conclusions. <b>Rather, they said</b> in conclusion <b>that</b> in some verses the conditions <b>implied</b> by the phrasing of the verse <b>preclude</b> the application of conditions that are <b>implied</b> by a previous verse; whereas in other verses, the conditions <b>implied</b> by the phrasing of the verse stand <b>on their own</b> and apply also in subsequent verses. However, there is no obvious pattern of how to determine which verse employs which style.",
    "<b>A <i>tanna</i></b> who would recite <i>baraitot</i> in the study hall <b>recited</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan: All slaughterings are valid</b> if performed <b>by a non-priest, except that of</b> the red <b>heifer. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Go out and teach</b> that <i>baraita</i> <b>outside</b> the house of study, but not inside, as it is incorrect. <b>We have not found</b> any case of <b>a slaughtering by a non-priest</b> that is <b>invalid.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> was very convinced of this. <b>Needless to say that he did not listen to</b> that <b><i>tanna</i>, but he did not even listen to his</b> own <b>teacher,</b> who maintained the same opinion as cited by the <i>tanna</i>, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: The slaughtering of the</b> red <b>heifer by a non-priest is invalid.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan added: <b>And I say it is valid,</b> for <b>we have not found</b> any case of <b>a slaughtering by a non-priest</b> that is <b>invalid.</b>",
    "The mishna states: The High Priest <b>comes</b> and stands <b>next to his bull a second</b> time and confesses: Please God, I have sinned…I and my family and the children of Aaron, your sacred people. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different about the first confession</b> that he made over the bull, in <b>which he did not say: And the children of Aaron, your sacred people, and what is different about the second confession</b> in <b>which he said: And the children of Aaron, your sacred people?</b>",
    "<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: That is</b> the method to which <b>the attribute of justice lends</b> itself: <b>Better that an innocent person should come and gain atonement on behalf of the guilty, and a guilty person should not come and gain atonement on behalf of</b> another <b>guilty person.</b> At the first confession, the High Priest has still not achieved atonement for himself. Therefore, it is more appropriate for him to wait until the second confession to seek atonement for the priesthood.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The High Priest <b>would slaughter</b> the bull <b>and receive its blood in a bowl, and give it to the one who stirs it.</b> The stirrer would stand <b>on the fourth row</b> of tiles <b>in the Sanctuary</b> and stir the blood <b>lest it coagulate</b> while the High Priest sacrificed the incense. <b>He would take a coal pan and ascend to the top of the altar and clear</b> the upper layer of <b>coals to</b> this <b>side and to</b> that <b>side and</b> with the coal pan <b>scoop up</b> coals <b>from</b> among <b>the inner, consumed</b> coals. <b>And he would</b> then <b>descend and place</b> the coal pan with the coals <b>on the fourth row</b> of tiles <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>",
    "The mishna comments on some of the contrasts between the service and protocols followed on Yom Kippur and those followed throughout the rest of the year: <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest <b>would scoop up</b> the coals with a coal pan made <b>of silver and pour</b> the coals from there <b>into</b> a coal pan <b>of gold. But</b> on <b>this day,</b> on Yom Kippur, the High Priest <b>scoops up with</b> a coal pan <b>of gold, and with</b> that coal pan <b>he would bring</b> the coals <b>into</b> the Holy of Holies.",
    "<b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest scoops up the coals with a coal pan <b>of four <i>kav</i> and pours</b> the coals <b>into</b> a coal pan of <b>three <i>kav</i>. But</b> on <b>this day,</b> the High Priest <b>scoops with</b> one of <b>three <i>kav</i>, and with it he would bring</b> the coals <b>into</b> the Holy of Holies. <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> a variation of this distinction: <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest scoops up the coals with a coal pan <b>of a <i>se’a</i>,</b> which is six <i>kav</i> <b>and</b> then <b>pours</b> the coals <b>into</b> a coal pan of <b>three <i>kav</i>. But</b> on <b>this day,</b> the High Priest <b>scoops with</b> a coal pan of <b>three <i>kav</i>, and with it he would bring</b> the coals <b>into</b> the Holy of Holies.",
    "<b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> the coal pan <b>was heavy. But</b> on <b>this day</b> it was <b>light,</b> so as not to tire the High Priest. <b>On every</b> other <b>day, its handle was short, but</b> on <b>this day it was long</b> so that he could also use his arm to support its weight. <b>On every</b> other <b>day, it was</b> of <b>greenish gold, but</b> on <b>this day</b> it was of <b>a red</b> gold. These are <b>the statements of Rabbi Menaḥem.</b>",
    "<b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> a priest <b>sacrificed a <i>peras</i>,</b> half a <i>maneh</i>, of incense <b>in the morning, and a <i>peras</i> in the afternoon, but</b> on <b>this day</b> the High Priest <b>adds</b> an additional <b>handful</b> of incense and burns it in the Holy of Holies. <b>On every</b> other <b>day,</b> the incense <b>was</b> ground <b>fine</b> as prescribed by the Torah, <b>but</b> on <b>this day it was superfine.</b>",
    "<b>On every</b> other <b>day, priests ascend on the eastern side of the ramp and descend on its western side, but</b> on <b>this day the High Priest ascends in the middle</b> of the ramp <b>and descends in the middle. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> There was no difference in this regard. Even during the rest of the year, <b>the High Priest always ascends in the middle</b> of the ramp <b>and descends in the middle,</b> due to his eminence.",
    "<b>On every</b> other <b>day, the High Priest sanctifies his hands and his feet from the laver</b> like the other priests, <b>and on this day</b> he sanctifies them <b>from the golden flask,</b> due to the eminence of the High Priest. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> there was no difference in this regard. Even during the rest of the year, <b>the High Priest always sanctifies his hands and his feet from the golden flask.</b>",
    "<b>On every</b> other <b>day there were four arrangements</b> of wood <b>there,</b> upon the altar, <b>but</b> on <b>this day there were five;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: On every</b> other <b>day</b> there were <b>three, but</b> on <b>this day</b> there were <b>four. Rabbi Yehuda says: On every</b> other <b>day</b> there were <b>two, but</b> on <b>this day</b> there were <b>three.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the blood of the bull is stirred by a priest standing on the fourth row of tiles in the Sanctuary, while the High Priest sacrifices the incense in the Holy of Holies. The Gemara asks: <b>But is it</b> not <b>written “And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting</b> when he goes in to make atonement in the Sanctuary, until he comes out” (Leviticus 16:17). How then could the stirrer be standing in the Sanctuary? <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> Emend and <b>teach</b> the mishna as saying: The fourth row of tiles <b>of the Sanctuary,</b> i.e., outside the Sanctuary on the fourth row from its entrance.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And there shall be no man in the Tent of Meeting</b> when he goes in to make atonement in the Sanctuary, until he comes out.” The verse prohibits anyone to be inside the Tent of Meeting during the burning of the incense."
