    "<b>if he can reduce his business, he should reduce</b> it; <b>and if not, he may carry on with them,</b> i.e., his business partners. He may act in partnership with the members of the group with which he is traveling, but he may not engage in business independently.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when do</b> the mourners <b>overturn</b> their <b>beds? From when</b> the corpse <b>is taken out of the opening of his house;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says: From when the</b> tomb <b>is sealed</b> with <b>the grave cover.</b>",
    "There was <b>an incident</b> in <b>which</b> the <i>Nasi</i> <b>Rabban Gamliel the Elder died,</b> and <b>once</b> his body <b>left the opening of his house, Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> the members of the household: <b>Overturn your beds. And once the</b> tomb <b>was sealed</b> with <b>the grave cover, Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: Overturn your beds. They</b> then <b>said to him: We already overturned</b> them <b>in accordance with the Elder,</b> i.e., Rabbi Eliezer.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when do</b> the mourners <b>stand</b> their <b>beds upright on Friday;</b> as the rites of mourning are not observed on Shabbat, and the beds must be returned to their ordinary position beforehand? <b>From <i>minḥa</i></b> time <b>onward. Rabba bar Huna said: Even so, one may not sit down on</b> his upright bed immediately. Rather, he must wait <b>until it becomes dark</b> to do so. <b>And at the conclusion of Shabbat, even if he has only one</b> more <b>day to sit</b> in mourning, i.e., his period of mourning concludes on Sunday, <b>he must</b> once <b>again overturn</b> his bed.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who</b> is in mourning and must <b>overturn his bed, he overturns not only his</b> own <b>bed, but rather he overturns all the beds he has in his house. And even if he has ten beds in ten</b> different <b>places, he overturns them all. And even</b> if there are <b>five brothers and one</b> of them <b>died, all of them overturn</b> their beds wherever they live.",
    "<b>If, however, it is a bed designated</b> for the storage of <b>garments</b> and not for sleeping, <b>he is not required to overturn it. It is</b> also <b>not necessary to overturn a <i>dargash</i>, but rather he stands it upright. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>dargash</i>, one loosens its loops [<i>karbitav</i>],</b> which hold up the pillows, <b>and it falls on its own.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>dargash</i>? Ulla said:</b> It is a good-<b>luck [<i>gada</i>] bed,</b> as it was common to have ornamental beds for good luck, which were not used for sleeping.",
    "<b>Rabba said to him: However, if</b> that is <b>so,</b> then the following statement <b>with regard to a king</b> is difficult, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 20a): When the mourner’s meal is served to the king and his family, <b>all the people recline on the ground, and he,</b> the king, due to his honor, <b>reclines on a <i>dargash</i>. Is there anything upon which we would not have seated him until now,</b> when he was not a mourner, <b>but now,</b> specifically during the mourning period, <b>we seat him on it?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ashi strongly objects to this: What is the difficulty</b> raised by Rabba? One can answer: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>just as it is in</b> the case of <b>eating and drinking,</b> that <b>until now,</b> before one became a mourner, <b>we did not feed him or give him drink,</b> but <b>now</b> that he is a mourner <b>we feed him and give him drink</b> during the first meal after the burial.",
    "<b>Rather, if it</b> is <b>difficult, this</b> is <b>difficult, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is not necessary to overturn a <i>dargash</i>, but rather he stands it upright. But if it is</b> a good-<b>luck bed, why is it not necessary to overturn it? Didn’t we learn: One who</b> is in mourning and must <b>overturn his bed overturns not only his</b> own <b>bed, but rather he overturns all the beds in his house,</b> including this good luck bed?",
    "The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what</b> is <b>difficult</b> in this? One can answer: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>just as it is in</b> the case of <b>a bed designated for</b> the storage of <b>garments, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If it is a bed designated for</b> the storage of <b>garments,</b> and not for sleeping, <b>one is not required to overturn it.</b> So too, one is not required to overturn a <i>dargash</i>, as it is a bed that is not used for sleeping.",
    "<b>Rather if it</b> is <b>difficult, this is the difficulty:</b> It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to <b>a <i>dargash</i>, one loosens the loops</b> that hold up the pillows, <b>and it falls on its own. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that a <i>dargash</i> is <b>a</b> good-<b>luck bed,</b> it is like other beds, so <b>what loops does it have?</b>",
    "<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>one of the Sages, whose name was Rav Taḥalifa from the West,</b> and <b>who was frequently</b> found <b>in the market of leather workers, said to him: What is a <i>dargash</i>?</b> It is <b>a leather bed.</b>",
    "<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: A <i>dargash</i></b> has <b>its interlacing from the inside,</b> i.e., attached to loops that go through holes that are made in the bed frame itself; whereas <b>a bed</b> has <b>its interlacing from the outside,</b> i.e., the strapping itself is looped around the wood of the frame, and therefore it cannot be loosened.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> with regard to a <i>dargash</i>. <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Aḥa said in the name of Rabbi Asi: A bed whose posts [<i>naklitin</i>] extend,</b> meaning that they are very long so that the bed will remain high off the ground even if it is overturned, <b>may be stood upright and that is sufficient.</b> That is to say, one is not required to overturn such a bed.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If the mourner <b>sleeps on a chair,</b> or <b>on a large</b> overturned <b>mortar,</b> or <b>on the ground, he does not fulfill his obligation,</b> even though he is uncomfortable while sleeping. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>because he did not fulfill</b> the mitzva of <b>overturning the bed.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may sweep and sprinkle</b> water on a dirt floor <b>in the house of a mourner, and one may wash bowls, cups, jugs, and pitchers in the house of a mourner. But one may not bring incense or</b> fragrant <b>spices into the house of a mourner.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t bar Kappara teach</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not recite a blessing either over incense or over fragrant spices in the house of a mourner?</b> From this one may infer that <b>one may not recite a blessing</b> over these incense or spices, <b>but one may bring them</b> into the house of the mourner. This appears to contradict the previous <i>baraita</i>.",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>It is not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to the house of a mourner,</b> into which spices should not be taken; <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that one may not recite a blessing over them, is referring <b>to the house of the consolers,</b> his relatives, into which spices may be brought.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One does not bring</b> the first meal after the burial <b>to the house of mourning on a small tray [<i>tavla</i>], in a bowl [<i>iskutla</i>], or in a narrow-mouthed basket [<i>kanon</i>], but rather in</b> ordinary <b>baskets. And the mourners’ blessing is not recited on</b> the intermediate days of <b>a Festival, but</b> the consolers may <b>stand in a row</b> when the mourners leave the cemetery <b>and console</b> them. <b>And</b> the mourners <b>dismiss the many</b> consolers, by telling them that they may return home after they have fulfilled the mitzva of consoling the mourners.",
    "<b>The bier</b> of the deceased <b>is not set down in the street</b> during the intermediate days of a Festival <b>so as not to encourage eulogies.</b> On an ordinary weekday, people would gather in the street around the bier to eulogize the deceased, but this should be avoided during the intermediate days of the Festival. <b>And</b> the biers <b>of women</b> are <b>never</b> set down, even if it is not the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>due to their honor.</b> Blood might drip from their bodies, and it would cause them dishonor if their blood stained the street.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first,</b> the meal after the burial <b>would be brought to the house of the mourner</b> in various ways. <b>The wealthy</b> would bring the meal <b>in baskets of silver and gold, and the poor</b> would bring it in <b>baskets of peeled willow branches. And the poor were embarrassed,</b> as everyone would see that they were poor. The Sages <b>instituted that everyone should bring</b> the meal <b>in baskets of peeled willow branches, due to the honor of the poor.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> a similar <i>baraita</i>: <b>At first, they would serve</b> wine <b>in the house of the mourner</b> during the first meal after the burial; the <b>wealthy</b> would do so <b>in</b> cups made from <b>white glass, and</b> the <b>poor</b> would serve this wine <b>in</b> cups of <b>colored glass. And the poor were embarrassed,</b> as everyone would see that they were poor. The Sages <b>instituted that all should serve drinks</b> in the house of the mourner <b>in colored glass</b> cups, <b>due to the honor of the poor.</b>",
    "Furthermore, <b>at first they would uncover the faces of the wealthy</b> who passed away <b>and cover the faces of the poor, because their faces were blackened by famine. And the poor were embarrassed</b> because they were buried in a different manner. The Sages <b>instituted that everyone’s face should be covered, due to the honor of the poor.</b>",
    "Additionally, <b>at first the wealthy would take</b> the deceased <b>out</b> for burial <b>on a <i>dargash</i>, and the poor</b> would take the deceased out"
