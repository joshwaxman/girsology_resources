    "The Gemara answers: <b>A mitzva is different,</b> and since it is a mitzva to put on phylacteries, the mourner is required to do so, even during the first three days.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>During the first three days</b> after his bereavement, <b>a mourner is prohibited from working, even if he is a poor person who is supported by charity. From this</b> point <b>forward, he may do</b> work <b>privately in his</b> own <b>home</b> if he needs to do so. <b>And</b> similarly <b>a woman may spin</b> thread <b>on a spindle in her</b> own <b>home</b> when she is mourning.",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>A mourner during the first three days</b> after his bereavement <b>may not go to</b> another <b>mourner’s house</b> to console him. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, he may go, but he may not sit among the consolers, but rather in the place of those being consoled,</b> i.e., with the mourners in that house.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in yet another <i>baraita</i>: <b>A mourner, during the first three days</b> after his bereavement, <b>is prohibited from extending greetings</b> to others. <b>From the third</b> day <b>to the seventh</b> day, <b>he may respond</b> when other people address him, <b>but he may not extend greetings</b> to them. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, he may extend greetings and respond in his</b> usual <b>manner.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: Is he really <b>prohibited</b> from extending <b>greetings during the first three</b> days of mourning? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident and the sons of Rabbi Akiva died, and all the Jews entered to eulogize them with a great eulogy.</b>",
    "<b>When they were about to take leave, Rabbi Akiva stood on a large bench and said: Our brothers, the house of Israel, listen! Even had my two sons been bridegrooms, I would have been consoled on account of the honor you have shown</b> them. <b>If you came</b> to console <b>for the sake of Akiva, there are many Akivas in the marketplace</b> whom the Jews do all not come to console. <b>Rather,</b> certainly <b>this is what you said</b> to yourselves: <b>“The Torah of his God is in his heart”</b> (Psalms 37:31), and you wished to show your respect for the Torah. <b>All the more so is your reward doubled,</b> for you have consoled mourners and shown respect for the Torah. <b>Return</b> now <b>to your homes in peace.</b> This indicates that a mourner may greet other people even on the first day of his mourning.",
    "The Gemara answers: Showing <b>respect for the public is different.</b> Rabbi Akiva was permitted to greet them to demonstrate courtesy and respect.",
    "§ It was taught in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the third</b> day <b>to the seventh</b> day, <b>he may respond</b> when other people address him, <b>but he may not extend greetings</b> to them. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, he may extend greetings and respond in his</b> usual <b>manner.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>One who finds another in mourning during the</b> first <b>thirty days</b> of that person’s bereavement <b>may</b> still <b>speak words of consolation to him, but he should not extend greetings toward him.</b> If he finds him <b>after thirty days, he may extend greetings toward him, but he should not speak words of consolation to him,</b> so as not to remind him of his pain.",
    "If it was the mourner’s <b>wife</b> who <b>died and he married another woman</b> within thirty days of his first wife’s death, <b>one may not enter his house to speak words of consolation with him,</b> so as not to offend his new wife. If, however, <b>he finds him</b> alone <b>in the marketplace, he may speak to him with gentle words and in a serious manner.</b> This indicates that the prohibition against extending greetings lasts for thirty days and not just seven.",
    "<b>Rav Idi bar Avin said:</b> The two <i>baraitot</i> refer to different situations: The first <i>baraita</i> is referring to the mourner <b>himself, who may extend greetings [<i>shalom</i>] to others</b> after the completion of his seven days of mourning, <b>as the others are at peace [<i>shalom</i>].</b> The second <i>baraita</i>, which speaks of a prohibition that lasts thirty days, is referring to <b>other people, who may not extend greetings to him, as he,</b> the mourner, <b>is not at peace.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that after the third day of his bereavement, the mourner may <b>respond</b> when other people address him, <b>by inference</b> others <b>may extend greetings to him.</b> The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case where people <b>did not know</b> that he was in mourning and unknowingly extended greetings to him.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the <i>baraita</i> speaks of a case where the people who greeted him were unaware that he was in mourning, then <b>there also,</b> during the first three days of his bereavement, he should be permitted to respond when other people address him. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> during the first three days, <b>he must inform them</b> that he is in mourning <b>and not respond</b> to their greetings. <b>Here,</b> after the first three days, <b>he need not inform them</b> about his bereavement, but rather he may respond to their greetings.",
    "<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>One who finds another in mourning during</b> his <b>twelve months</b> of bereavement <b>may</b> still <b>speak words of consolation to him, but he should not extend greetings toward him.</b> If he finds him <b>after twelve months, he may extend greetings toward him, and he should not speak words of consolation to him. He may, however, speak to him indirectly,</b> i.e., he may say to him: May you be consoled, without mentioning the name of the deceased.",
    "<b>Rabbi Meir said: One who finds another in mourning after twelve months and speaks to him words of consolation, to what may</b> this situation <b>be likened? To a person who broke his leg and it healed,</b> and afterward a physician <b>found him and said to him: Come to me, for I will break it</b> a second time <b>and</b> then <b>I will heal it, so that you may know how good my medicines are</b> and how well they work. One who consoles his friend after so much time has passed acts in a similar fashion, stirring up an old wound and then trying to heal it. In any event, it appears that one must not extend greetings to a mourner during the entire twelve-month mourning period.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>This is not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which says that one must not extend greetings to a mourner for twelve months, is referring to one who lost <b>his father or mother. That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that a mourner may be greeted after seven days, is referring to one who is in mourning over <b>other relatives.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> in the case of other relatives after thirty days, <b>let him speak words of consolation to him indirectly.</b> Why does the <i>baraita</i> say that after thirty days he should not speak words of consolation to him at all? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so. And what</b> is meant by the words: <b>He should not speak words of consolation to him?</b> This means that he may not console him <b>in his</b> usual <b>manner, but he may speak to him indirectly.</b>",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a mourner comes</b> to the house of mourning <b>from a nearby place during the first three days</b> of mourning, <b>he counts</b> his days of mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners from the time of the burial and completes his mourning with them. This is the case even if he may end up observing mourning for only five or six days. But if <b>he came from a distant place, he counts on his own</b> seven complete days from the time that he was informed of his relative’s death. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., after the first three days of mourning, <b>even if he came from a nearby place, he counts</b> seven days <b>on his own. Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if <b>he came on the seventh day from a nearby place, he counts</b> and completes the seven-day period of mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners.",
    "<b>The Master said,</b> citing the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a mourner comes</b> to the house of mourning <b>from a nearby place during the first three days</b> of mourning, <b>he counts</b> his days of mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners and completes his mourning with them. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: This is</b> in a case <b>where the principal</b> member <b>of the household is in the house,</b> and therefore all the other family members follow his mourning. If, however, it is the principal member of the family who comes home, he certainly does not follow the other members, but rather he counts seven days on his own.",
    "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the scholars:"
