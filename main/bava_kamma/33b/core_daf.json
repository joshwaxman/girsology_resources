    "does he say that <b>since</b> the ox <b>is liened</b> to the debt <b>to the injured</b> party, who will collect it should the ox’s owner not have sufficient funds, <b>it is not in his</b> power to sell it? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is not sold.</b>",
    "Rava asked him: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if <b>he sold it, it is sold?</b> Rav Naḥman replied: Nevertheless, the injured party <b>then collects it</b> from the purchaser. The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> the injured party <b>then collects it</b> from the purchaser, <b>with regard to what</b> matter <b>is it sold?</b> His right to collect it negates the effectiveness of the sale. The Gemara answers: It is sold <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>plowing [<i>ridya</i>].</b> The purchaser may use the ox for plowing until the injured party collects it from him, and the purchaser is not required to reimburse the injured party for the use of his ox.",
    "The Gemara asks: Should one <b>conclude from</b> this ruling that with regard to one who <b>borrows</b> money <b>and</b> then <b>sells</b> his <b>movable property, the court can collect</b> the debt <b>from</b> this property <b>on behalf of</b> the creditor, as according to Rabbi Yishmael the belligerent ox is only a lien for the debt owed to the injured party? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the belligerent ox, <b>it is different, as</b> the owner of the ox <b>is</b> considered <b>like one who rendered it designated payment</b> of the debt, since the Torah specifies that the injured party collects damages from the ox. In general, however, movable property that is sold by a debtor cannot be collected by the creditor.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rava say</b> that if one <b>rendered his slave</b> as <b>designated repayment</b> for a debt <b>and</b> subsequently <b>sold him,</b> the <b>creditor collects</b> payment <b>from</b> the purchaser, whereas if one rendered <b>his ox</b> as <b>designated repayment and</b> then <b>sold it, the creditor cannot collect</b> it <b>from</b> the purchaser? This contradicts the previous statement that the belligerent ox is considered designated repayment, and therefore even if it is sold the injured party can collect it from the purchaser.",
    "The Gemara answers: The distinction made in Rava’s statement answers this question. <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>a slave</b> who was rendered as designated repayment can be collected from the purchaser? It is <b>because</b> rendering a slave as designated repayment is not common and generates <b>publicity.</b> The purchaser was therefore aware of this when he bought the slave. Similarly, with regard to <b>this</b> ox <b>as well, since it gored</b> an animal, it generates <b>publicity, as</b> it is publicly <b>called a goring ox,</b> and so the purchaser was aware of the lien attached to it. Therefore, the injured party can collect it from the purchaser.",
    "<b>Rav Taḥalifa from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> with regard to the belligerent ox <b>before Rabbi Abbahu:</b> If <b>he sold it, it is not sold,</b> but if <b>he consecrated it, it is consecrated.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Who sold it?</b> Is it the injured party or the liable party? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>the one liable for the damage, whose</b> opinion is it that if <b>he sold it,</b> it is <b>not sold? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>the ox was</b> already <b>assigned</b> to the injured party. <b>But</b> in the following statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated, we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that <b>the ox shall be appraised in court.</b>",
    "If, <b>rather,</b> it is referring to <b>the injured</b> party selling it, <b>whose</b> opinion is it that if <b>he sold it, it is not sold?</b> It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that the injured party has no share of ownership in the ox until it is transferred to him by the court. But in the statement that if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated, we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not seem to accord with either opinion.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to <b>the one liable for the damage, and everyone agrees</b> with its ruling. The ruling that if <b>he sold it, it is not sold</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, as</b> the ox <b>is liened to the injured</b> party, precluding the owner from selling it.",
    "The statement that if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated,</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> according <b>to Rabbi Akiva,</b> since it is not actually consecrated but is considered so only <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu. As Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that if one consecrates liened property, although the consecration does not take effect, nevertheless he is required to redeem it, due to a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>consecrated</b> property can be <b>removed</b> from the ownership of the Temple treasury <b>without redemption.</b> Therefore, the ineffectiveness of the ox’s consecration notwithstanding, he is still required to redeem it, by means of minimal payment, so as not to cause the denigration of Temple property.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an innocuous ox that caused damage,</b> if, <b>before</b> its owner <b>stood trial, he sold it,</b> it is <b>sold.</b> If <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated.</b> If <b>he slaughtered it or gave it as a gift, what he did is done,</b> i.e., takes effect. By contrast, <b>once he stood trial</b> and is now obligated to pay the injured party, if <b>he sold it, it is not sold;</b> if <b>he consecrated it, it is not consecrated;</b> if <b>he slaughtered it or gave it is a gift, he has done nothing.</b>",
    "If <b>creditors</b> of the ox’s owner <b>collected</b> the ox <b>first, whether he owed</b> the creditors <b>before</b> his ox <b>caused</b> the <b>damage or whether it caused</b> the <b>damage before he owed</b> them, <b>they have done nothing.</b> Their collection is void, <b>because</b> compensation to the injured party is <b>paid only from the body of</b> the ox, as it was innocuous, and it is therefore designated exclusively for this compensation.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>that caused damage, whether</b> its owner <b>stood trial or whether he did not stand trial,</b> if <b>he sold it,</b> it is <b>sold;</b> if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated;</b> if <b>he slaughtered it or gave it as a gift, what he did is done.</b> Likewise, if <b>creditors collected</b> the ox <b>first, whether he owed</b> them <b>before it caused</b> the <b>damage,</b> or <b>whether it caused</b> the <b>damage before he owed</b> them, <b>what</b> they <b>did is done.</b> This is <b>because</b> the restitution is <b>paid only from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, not from the body of the ox. Therefore, what he or his creditors do with the ox takes effect.",
    "The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above, with regard to an innocuous ox, that if <b>he sold it,</b> it is <b>sold.</b> As explained above, the sale is valid only with regard to the purchaser using the ox <b>for plowing</b> in the interim, until the injured party collects it.",
    "The statement that if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated</b> does not mean that it is actually consecrated, but rather that it must be redeemed through payment of a minimal sum, <b>due to Rabbi Abbahu’s</b> statement mentioned above.",
    "With regard to the statement that if <b>he slaughtered it or gave it as a present, what he did is done,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> if <b>he gave it as a present, what he did is done</b> with regard to the recipient’s permission to use it <b>for plowing. But</b> if <b>he slaughtered it,</b> how does that affect the injured party’s rights? <b>Let him come and receive payment from</b> the slaughtered ox’s <b>meat.</b>",
    "This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated in the Torah: “Then they shall sell the <b>live</b> ox” (Exodus 21:35). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the injured party receives a share of ownership if the belligerent ox is <b>alive. From where</b> do I derive that this applies even if the ox’s owner <b>slaughtered it? The verse states: “Then they shall sell</b> the live <b>ox,”</b> indicating that <b>in any case,</b> whatever the circumstances, the injured party is paid from proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox.",
    "<b>Rav Sheizevi said:</b> This statement <b>is necessary only</b> with regard <b>to the diminished</b> value of the ox due to its <b>slaughter.</b> Although the value of the ox may no longer cover the damage, its owner is not liable to compensate the injured party beyond the ox’s current value.",
    "<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: That is to say</b> that <b>one who causes damage to another’s liened property is exempt</b> from paying compensation, since the property does not actually belong to the one who holds the lien.",
    "The Gemara asks: Isn’t this inference from the <i>baraita</i> <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, states this <i>halakha</i> <b>lest you say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>there,</b> in the case where one slaughters a liened ox, that he is exempt, <b>as he can say to him: I have not detracted anything from</b> what is <b>yours, as he can say to him: I took only spirit from</b> what is <b>yours.</b> He detracted only the life of the ox, not its physical body, and one who causes damage to another’s liened property might be exempt from liability for this intangible damage. <b>But generally</b> one who causes damage to another’s lien <b>should be liable.</b> Therefore, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <b>teaches us</b> that one is exempt from liability for all types of damage he causes to another’s liened property.",
    "The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Rabba stated this</b> principle, <b>as well,</b> and there would be no need for Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, to state it. <b>As Rabba says: One who burns another’s documents,</b> in which other people’s debts to him are recorded, <b>is exempt,</b> although the owner of the documents can no longer collect payment from liened property.",
    "The Gemara answers: Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, states this principle <b>lest you say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>there</b> that he is exempt, <b>as</b> the perpetrator of the damage <b>can say to</b> the owner of the documents: <b>I burned your mere paper,</b> for which I am prepared to pay. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where one dug pits, ditches, or caves on</b> liened land, causing substantial damage, <b>he should be liable</b> to compensate the one holding the lien. Therefore, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <b>teaches us</b> that even in a case of substantial damage he is exempt, <b>as</b> the case <b>here,</b> where the ox was slaughtered, <b>is like one who dug pits, ditches, or caves,</b> as slaughter is considered substantial damage, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said</b> that in this case <b>what he did is done.</b>",
    "The Gemara continues to explain the <i>baraita</i>, which states: If <b>creditors collected</b> the innocuous ox <b>first, whether</b> its owner <b>owed</b> them <b>before</b> his ox <b>caused damage or whether it caused damage before he owed</b> them, they <b>have done nothing, because</b> restitution is <b>paid only from the body of</b> the ox.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> in the case where <b>it caused damage before he owed</b> them, <b>the injured parties came first,</b> and the ox is liened to the debt. <b>But</b> in the case where <b>he owed</b> them <b>before it caused damage, the creditor</b> collected it <b>first,</b> so why does he not have the preemptive right to the ox?"
