    "<b>And if</b> it is a case <b>where one did not declare them ownerless, there is still a difficulty. If</b> Rav Pappa’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says: We learned</b> that one is liable for damage caused by <b>all</b> obstacles that he places in a public domain, whether or not he declares them ownerless, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>one’s pit, these</b> cases <b>are</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit. And if</b> Rav Pappa’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says: We learned</b> that one is liable for damage caused by <b>all</b> obstacles that he places in a public domain that he did not declare ownerless, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>one’s ox</b> that gored another animal, <b>these</b> cases <b>are</b> a subcategory of <b>Ox.</b> With regard to the subcategories of Ox, the Gemara already established that their legal status is like that of the primary category of Ox.",
    "The Gemara asks concerning an obstacle that is a subcategory of Pit: <b>What is different</b> about <b>Pit</b> that it is defined it as a unique category? It is <b>that its initial formation,</b> i.e., the digging of the pit, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> it is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage to others, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> In <b>these</b> subcategories of Pit, <b>too, their initial formation,</b> i.e., the placement of the obstacle in the public domain, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> they are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you. Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of Pit is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Pit, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he is referring <b>to a subcategory of <i>Maveh</i>.</b>",
    "The meaning of the term <i>Maveh</i> is not clear; therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the primary category of <i>Maveh</i> to whose subcategories the Gemara referred? <b>If</b> one suggests that Rav Pappa said his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is the category of <b>Eating,</b> this cannot be Rav Pappa’s intent. <b>But didn’t we</b> already <b>establish</b> that the legal status of <b>a subcategory of Eating is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Eating?</b> Clearly, Rav Pappa was not referring to subcategories of <i>Maveh</i>. And <b>if</b> one suggests that Rav Pappa said his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is the primary category of <b>Man,</b> which includes damage caused by a person, not by his property or animals, <b>what primary categories and what subcategories are there in</b> that category? The <i>halakha</i> is the same with regard to all damage that a person causes.",
    "<b>And if you would say</b> that there is a distinction: The <b>primary category</b> is a case where one causes damage while <b>awake,</b> and <b>a subcategory</b> is a case where one causes damage while <b>asleep; but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (26a): The legal status of <b>a person</b> is <b>always</b> that of one <b>forewarned,</b> and he is liable for any damage that he causes, <b>both</b> when <b>he is awake and</b> when <b>he is asleep?</b> Accordingly, that is not the distinction between a primary category and a subcategory.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rav Pappa was referring <b>to</b> cases where one causes damage with <b>his phlegm or his spittle.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where one would be liable for damage in that case? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> his phlegm and spittle <b>cause damage as they were moving</b> through the air after the person expectorated, that <b>is</b> damage caused by <b>his</b> direct <b>action</b> and there is no room to distinguish between the damage that it caused and any other damage caused by one’s direct action. <b>If</b> it is a case where his phlegm or spittle causes damage <b>after it comes to rest</b> on the ground, e.g., if one slipped in the spittle, fell, and was injured, <b>both according to Rav and according to Shmuel this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit,</b> as the spittle is an ownerless obstacle in the public domain. <b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of <i>Maveh</i> is like</b> that of the primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i>, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them; he was referring <b>to a subcategory of Fire.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is a subcategory of Fire? If we say</b> that it is a case of <b>his stone, his knife, or his load, where he placed them on top of his roof, and they fell</b> off the roof <b>by means of a common wind, and they caused damage, what are the circumstances</b> in which one would be liable for the damage that was caused? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> those items <b>caused damage as they were moving</b> through the air propelled by the wind, <b>that is</b> a case of <b>Fire.</b>",
    "If so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Fire</b> that defines it as a unique category? What is different is <b>that another force,</b> the wind, <b>is involved with</b> the fire in causing damage, as the wind causes the fire to spread, <b>and</b> the fire is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> In <b>these</b> subcategories of Fire <b>too, another force is involved with</b> the items placed on the roof and causes damage, as the wind causes them to fall, <b>and</b> they are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you. Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of Fire is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Fire, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he was referring <b>to a subcategory of Trampling.</b>",
    "The Gemara questions this explanation: A subcategory of <b>Trampling? But didn’t we</b> already <b>establish that</b> the status of <b>a subcategory of Trampling is similar to</b> that of the primary category of <b>Trampling?</b> The Gemara explains: Rav Pappa was referring <b>to</b> one’s liability to pay <b>half the</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles</b> in a case where they were inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, <b>which is a <i>halakha</i> learned through tradition</b> and not explicitly written in the Torah.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if it is a unique halakhic category and the payment is different, <b>why is it characterized</b> as <b>a subcategory of Trampling?</b> The Gemara explains: It is due to the fact that it shares a common aspect with Trampling. One whose animal propels pebbles while it walks and thereby causes damage is liable <b>to pay</b> half of the damages <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, and he does not pay only from the body of his animal, as is the <i>halakha</i> concerning half the cost of the damage paid by the owner of an innocuous ox that gored a person or an animal.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rava raise a dilemma</b> with regard to that matter? <b>As Rava raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to one’s liability to pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles</b> propelled by the foot of his animal, does <b>one pay</b> damages exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of his ox that caused the damage, <b>or</b> does <b>one pay</b> damages <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property?",
    "The Gemara explains: Although <b>it is a dilemma for Rava, it is obvious to Rav Pappa</b> that one pays from his superior-quality property, and in that sense, he classified the pebbles that cause damage as a subcategory of Trampling.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>According to Rava, who raises it as a dilemma, why is it characterized</b> as <b>a subcategory of Trampling</b> when its legal status is different both in terms of the extent of one’s liability and in terms of the manner of payment? The Gemara explains: It is classified as a subcategory of Trampling in order <b>to exempt</b> from liability pebbles that cause damage <b>in the public domain,</b> just as damage in the category of Trampling is exempt in the public domain.",
    "§ One of the primary categories of damage enumerated in the mishna is <b>the</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i> and</b> another is <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>Maveh</i>? Rav says: <i>Maveh</i>, that</b> is the category of <b>Man,</b> which includes a person who causes damage, but not the property or animal of a person that causes damage. <b>And Shmuel says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating.</b>",
    "The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is the category of <b>Man, as it is written: “The watchman said: Morning has come, and also night; if you will inquire [<i>tivayun</i>], inquire [<i>be’ayu</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 21:12). The terms “<i>tivayun</i>” and “<i>be’ayu</i>,” meaning inquire, refer to a person, who is able to inquire. Accordingly, <i>Maveh</i> relates to an action performed by a person.",
    "<b>And Shmuel says: <i>Maveh</i>, this is the</b> category of <b>Eating, as it is written: “How is Esau searched out [<i>neḥpesu</i>]; how are his hidden places revealed [<i>nivu</i>]”</b> (Obadiah 1:6)? The terms <i>nivu</i> and <i>maveh</i> share a common root. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that <i>nivu</i> connotes Eating? The Gemara explains that it is <b>as Rav Yosef translates</b> the verse into Aramaic: <b>How is Esau searched out [<i>itbelish</i>]; how are his hidden places revealed [<i>itgaleyan</i>]?</b> The meaning of the Aramaic term <i>itgaleyan</i> means revealed, and that is the meaning of the Hebrew term “<i>nivu</i>.” <i>Maveh</i> references the animal’s teeth, which are covered when its mouth is closed and revealed when it eats.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rav, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> refers to Eating, <b>as</b> does <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara explains that Rav could have <b>said to you: Is it taught</b> in the mishna: <b><i>Niveh</i>?</b> <i>Niveh</i> is the passive form of the word <i>maveh</i>, which would be the appropriate form if the reference was to teeth that are revealed. The term in the mishna is <i>maveh</i>, an active form of the verb.",
    "<b>And</b> as for <b>Shmuel, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> refers to the category of Man, <b>as</b> does <b>Rav?</b> The Gemara explains that Shmuel could have <b>said to you: Is it taught</b> in the mishna: <b><i>Bo’eh</i>?</b> <i>Bo’eh</i> is a form of the word <i>maveh</i> connoting an action taken directly, which would be appropriate were the reference to one’s actions that cause damage. The term in the mishna is <i>maveh</i>, which connotes an action that one causes another to take.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>After all, the</b> meaning of the term in the <b>verses is not precise according to</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>and</b> it <b>is not precise according to</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel. It is apparent that their dispute is not based upon their interpretation of the verses; it must be based on another issue. The Gemara asks again: As for <b>Rav, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> refers to Eating, <b>as</b> does <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara explains: Rav holds that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the primary category of <b>Ox</b> in the mishna. This includes damage caused by an ox <b>and all matters</b> involving damaging actions <b>that</b> are completed by <b>an ox,</b> i.e., the actions included in the categories of Goring, Eating, and Trampling. Perforce, <i>Maveh</i> refers to a different category of damage, i.e., Man.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Shmuel too,</b> who interpreted <i>Maveh</i> as Eating, <b>doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the category of <b>Ox,</b> which should include all matters involving damaging actions that are completed by an ox? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that according to Shmuel, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches Ox</b> specifically with regard <b>to</b> damage caused with <b>its horn, and</b> it teaches <b><i>Maveh</i></b> with regard <b>to</b> damage caused with <b>its tooth. And</b> when the mishna contrasts Ox with <i>Maveh</i>, <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> The defining <b>characteristic</b> of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Goring, where there is no</b> inherent <b>pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage, is not similar to</b> the defining <b>characteristic</b> of <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating, where there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage.</b>"
