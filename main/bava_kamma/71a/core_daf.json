    "and <b>even so, since</b> the thief <b>transfers ownership to</b> the purchaser <b>in this</b> manner, <b>it is</b> considered a valid <b>sale,</b> and he is required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>on Yom Kippur</b> he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Sages <b>say,</b> questioning this ruling: <b>Why</b> is he liable to pay it? <b>Although there is no</b> penalty of <b>execution</b> for slaughtering on Yom Kippur, <b>nevertheless there is</b> the penalty of <b>lashes; and we maintain that</b> one <b>is not</b> sentenced to be <b>flogged and</b> obligated to <b>pay</b> for the same act.",
    "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says:</b> One is sentenced to be <b>flogged and</b> obligated to <b>pay</b> for the same action.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> then <b>even</b> if he <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is a capital offense, he should be obligated to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, whereas the mishna (74b) states that in this case he is exempt. <b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Meir <b>holds</b> that one is sentenced to be <b>flogged and</b> obligated to <b>pay</b> for the same act, but <b>he does not hold</b> that one is sentenced to the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> obligated to <b>pay</b> for the same act, this is incorrect.",
    "<b>And</b> is it correct to say that Rabbi Meir does <b>not</b> maintain that one can be sentenced to the death penalty and to pay for the same act? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>on Shabbat,</b> or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>for idol worship,</b> or if <b>he stole an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned,</b> from which it is prohibited to derive any benefit, <b>and he slaughtered it,</b> he <b>pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold</b> payment; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis exempt</b> him from this payment. Apparently Rabbi Meir maintains that one can be held liable for monetary payment and for capital punishment for the same act, e.g., slaughtering on Shabbat or slaughtering for idol worship.",
    "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Stand <b>apart from this</b> <i>baraita</i>, i.e., this <i>baraita</i> should not be understood in a straightforward manner, <b>as it was stated concerning it: Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says,</b> and <b>Rabbi Avin and Rabbi Ela and the entire group</b> of disciples of Rabbi Yoḥanan also <b>say in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>of</b> a thief who <b>slaughters</b> the stolen animal <b>through</b> the agency of <b>another</b> person, i.e., he instructed another to slaughter it, and that agent did so on Shabbat or for idolatrous purposes. The thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment because he himself did not commit a capital offense.",
    "The Gemara asks: How can it be that a thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if another person slaughters the stolen animal for him? <b>But</b> is it <b>so</b> that <b>this</b> one <b>sins and that</b> one <b>becomes liable?</b>",
    "The Gemara provides several reasons why in the case of fourfold or fivefold payment it is possible for the thief to be liable for another’s actions. <b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is different here, as the verse states: “And slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), thereby juxtaposing the two acts of slaughtering and selling. It is derived that <b>just as</b> there is liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment through <b>selling,</b> which by definition is performed <b>by means of another</b> party, <b>so too,</b> there is liability for <b>slaughtering</b> when it is performed <b>by means of another</b> party.",
    "<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael teaches:</b> The word <b>“or”</b> in the phrase: “And slaughter it or sell it,” serves <b>to include</b> a case in which <b>the agent</b> slaughters or sells the animal at the behest of the thief. <b>The school of Ḥizkiyya teaches:</b> The separate word <b>“for” [<i>taḥat</i>]</b> in the phrase: “He shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep,” which could have been avoided by using the mere prefix of the letter <i>beit</i>, serves <b>to include</b> a case in which <b>the agent</b> slaughters the animal on behalf of the thief.",
    "<b>Mar Zutra objects to this</b> explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Is there anything</b> with regard to <b>which if</b> one <b>performs</b> it <b>himself</b> he is <b>not liable, and</b> if his <b>agent performs</b> it on his behalf one is <b>liable?</b> How is it possible for an agent to have more power than the one who appointed him? Can it be that if the thief himself slaughtered the animal on Shabbat he would be exempt, whereas if he has it slaughtered by another he is liable?",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said to him: There,</b> in the case of the thief who slaughters a stolen animal on Shabbat, <b>it is not because he is not liable</b> that he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment; <b>rather,</b> he is liable but he is excused from payment <b>because he receives the greater of</b> the two punishments, i.e., execution, for desecrating Shabbat. When he appoints an agent he has no liability for desecrating Shabbat, and therefore he pays for the slaughter.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>about</b> a thief who <b>slaughters through</b> the agency of <b>another</b> person, <b>what is the reason of the Rabbis, who exempt</b> the thief from payment? The thief did not himself do any act for which he is liable to receive the death penalty.",
    "The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation: <b>Who</b> are these <b>Rabbis</b> of the <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> The legal status of an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <b>is not considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter.</b> Since slaughtering on Shabbat or slaughtering for idolatrous purposes does not render the meat fit for consumption, Rabbi Shimon rules that there is no liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment.",
    "The Sages <b>say,</b> questioning this explanation: <b>Granted,</b> slaughtering for <b>idol worship and</b> slaughtering <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned are</b> cases of <b>slaughter that is not fit,</b> as in both of these cases it is prohibited to derive any benefit from the animal’s flesh. <b>But</b> slaughtering on <b>Shabbat is a fit slaughter. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 14a): In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, although he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for desecrating Shabbat, <b>his slaughter is valid</b> and the meat may be eaten.",
    "The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Rabbi Shimon <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar,</b> who disagrees with that mishna and prohibits eating the meat of an animal slaughtered on Shabbat.",
    "<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): In the case of <b>one who cooks</b> food <b>on Shabbat,</b> if he acted <b>unwittingly he may eat</b> the food, but if he acted <b>intentionally he may not eat</b> it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he acted <b>unwittingly he may eat</b> the food only <b>upon the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> and if he acted <b>intentionally he may not eat</b> it <b>ever,</b> although others may partake of it.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar says:</b> If he cooked the food <b>unwittingly</b> it <b>may be eaten upon the conclusion of Shabbat by others</b> only, <b>but not by him;</b> and if he acted <b>intentionally it may not be eaten ever, neither by him nor by others.</b> Slaughter, like cooking, is a desecration of Shabbat that entails the death penalty. It follows that Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar maintains that the meat of an animal intentionally slaughtered on Shabbat may never be eaten. If so, this is a slaughter that does not render the meat fit for consumption, and therefore according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon there is no fourfold or fivefold payment.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar?</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> It is written: <b>“And you shall observe Shabbat, for it is holy [<i>kodesh</i>] to you;</b> one who profanes it shall be put to death” (Exodus 31:14). <b>Just as it is prohibited to eat a sacred</b> item consecrated to the Temple [<i>kodesh</i>], <b>so too is it prohibited to eat</b> food produced though <b>action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps the analogy should be extended: <b>Just as it is prohibited to derive benefit</b> from <b>a sacred</b> item, <b>so too</b> should it be <b>prohibited to derive benefit</b> from a product of <b>an action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “It is holy <b>to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that <b>it shall be yours</b> for deriving benefit. Although food cooked on Shabbat may not be eaten, it is permitted to benefit from it in other ways.",
    "The Gemara further asks: Based on the analogy between a sacred item and the product of an action that desecrates Shabbat, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if the action were performed <b>unwittingly</b> it should be prohibited to consume the product, like a sacred item. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “One who profanes it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that it is <b>with regard to</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>intentionally</b> that <b>I said</b> this analogy <b>to you,</b> as the verse clearly is referring to one who is liable to receive the death penalty, <b>but not</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>unwittingly,</b> who is not executed.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to</b> this matter. <b>One said</b> that the product of <b>an action</b> that constitutes a desecration of <b>Shabbat</b> is forbidden <b>by Torah law, and one said</b> that the product of <b>an action</b> that constitutes a desecration of <b>Shabbat</b> is forbidden <b>by rabbinic</b> law.",
    "The Gemara elaborates: <b>The one who says</b> it is forbidden <b>by Torah law</b> explains <b>as we said,</b> that the prohibition is based on the verse as interpreted by Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>And the one who says</b> it is forbidden <b>by rabbinic law</b> would say that <b>the verse states: “It is holy,”</b> from which he infers: <b>It,</b> the day itself, <b>is holy but</b> the products of <b>its</b> prohibited <b>actions are not holy,</b> and therefore they are not compared to sacred items and may be eaten by Torah law.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that products of a prohibited act are prohibited <b>by Torah law, it is for</b>"
