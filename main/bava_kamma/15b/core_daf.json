    "If one admits: <b>My ox killed so-and-so, or</b> my ox killed <b>so-and-so’s ox,</b> then <b>this</b> person <b>pays based on his own</b> admission.",
    "The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What, is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna <b>not</b> stated <b>with regard to an innocuous ox?</b> If so, this mishna proves that one is required to pay for half the cost of the damage even based on one’s own admission, which demonstrates that the payment is monetary restitution and not a fine.",
    "The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>No,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this explanation, if it had been an <b>innocuous</b> ox that gored, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Would one say that <b>indeed, he does not pay based on his own</b> admission? But <b>if so, rather than teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna in <i>Ketubot</i>: If one admits: <b>My ox killed so-and-so’s</b> Canaanite <b>slave, he does not pay based on his own</b> admission, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>differentiate and teach</b> the distinction <b>with regard to</b> the case raised in the first clause <b>itself.</b> The reason for the distinction between the cases when one’s ox kills a Jew or a Canaanite slave is that in the first one pays monetary restitution, while in the second one pays a fine. If the mishna wishes to demonstrate the difference between a fine and monetary restitution with regard to admission, then instead of introducing a new case, the mishna would have modified the case of the previous clause.",
    "The mishna would have continued: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> in the first clause <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox, <b>but with regard to</b> an admission that one’s <b>innocuous</b> ox gored, <b>he does not pay based on his own</b> admission. The fact that the mishna does not do so suggests that in fact one is required to pay for half the cost of the damage based on one’s own admission that his innocuous ox gored. Evidently, the payment is considered to be monetary restitution.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: The reason the mishna did not raise the distinction between an innocuous and a forewarned ox is not because that distinction is not a valid one, but because the <b>entire</b> mishna <b>speaks</b> only <b>of</b> cases of <b>a forewarned</b> ox. Accordingly, no proof can be adduced from the mishna.",
    "The Gemara suggests further: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the concluding clause of the mishna just cited: <b>This is the principle: Anyone who pays more than</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged does not pay based on his own</b> admission. The Gemara infers: <b>What, is it not</b> that were he liable to pay <b>less than</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged, he would pay</b> based on his own admission? Since when an innocuous ox gores, its owner is liable to pay more than the cost of the damage, the payment is clearly not monetary restitution, and this is why it is not payable based on one’s own admission.",
    "The Gemara rejects the inference: <b>No,</b> one should infer only that were he liable to pay <b>as much as</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged, he pays</b> based on his own admission. If the sum to be paid is more or less than the cost of that which he damaged, he would not pay based on his own admission.",
    "The Gemara asks. <b>But</b> according to that opinion, where one is liable to pay <b>less</b> than the cost of the damage, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Would one say that, <b>indeed, he does not pay</b> based on his own admission? <b>If so, instead of teaching: This is the principle: Anyone who pays more than</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged does not pay based on his own</b> admission, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> instead: <b>This is the principle: Anyone who does not pay as much as</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged</b> does not pay based on his own admission. <b>As</b> that statement <b>indicates</b> cases where one is liable to pay <b>more</b> than the cost of that which he damaged <b>and it</b> also <b>indicates</b> cases where one is liable to pay <b>less</b> than the cost of that which he damaged. Evidently, the mishna holds that where one’s liability is for less than the cost of the damage, it is payable based on one’s own admission. This therefore provides <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine.",
    "The Gemara adds: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the payment for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage is a fine.</b>",
    "The Gemara notes the obvious inconsistency: How can it be that the Gemara offers <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine <b>and</b> then state that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with that opinion?",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>Yes,</b> the <i>halakha</i> may be in accordance with that opinion because of the following resolution of the refutation. <b>What is the reason</b> that the Gemara held that <b>there is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine? <b>Because</b> the mishna <b>does not teach:</b> Anyone who does not pay <b>as much as</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged</b> does not pay based on his own admission. This is not, in fact, a conclusive refutation, as even if one holds that the payment of half the cost of the damage for an innocuous ox is considered monetary restitution, one can still explain why the mishna doesn’t discuss cases where one is liable for less than the cost of the damage.",
    "This is because the <i>tanna</i> <b>cannot make an absolute</b> statement about such cases, that one never pays based on one’s own admission. <b>Since there is</b> an obligation for one to pay for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> resulting from <b>pebbles</b> inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, <b>which, through tradition it is learned that</b> this payment <b>is monetary restitution,</b> and it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the mishna <b>does not teach</b> cases where one’s liability is valued at less than the cost of the damage.",
    "The Gemara considers the ramifications of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And now that you have said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that the payment of <b>half the</b> cost of the <b>damage is a fine,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> innocuous <b>dog that ate lambs or</b> this innocuous <b>cat that ate a chicken,</b> which <b>is atypical</b> behavior for dogs and cats, <b>we do not collect</b> the payment for these acts in the courts <b>in Babylonia.</b> Since it is not common for these animals to eat those animals, these acts are classified as Goring, irrespective of the fact that the animal gained pleasure from the damage, for which it would normally be classified in the category of Eating. Therefore, in cases where these animals had not performed this act of damaging before, and were therefore considered innocuous, the owner is liable for only half the cost of the damage, which is a fine. Since the collection of fines may be imposed only by judges who have been ordained, and ordination is given only in Eretz Yisrael, these payments are not collected in Babylonia.",
    "The Gemara adds: <b>And this matter</b> applies only <b>where</b> they attacked <b>large</b> animals, as it is atypical behavior for them; <b>but where</b> they attacked <b>small</b> animals, since that <b>is their</b> typical <b>manner</b> of behavior, it is classified as Eating, for which the owner pays the full cost of the damage, which is certainly considered monetary restitution. Accordingly, the payment is collected by the courts in Babylonia.",
    "<b>And</b> even in a case where the payment is considered a fine, <b>if</b> the injured party <b>seized</b> the property of the owner of the belligerent animal in order to cover his loss, <b>we do not reclaim</b> it <b>from him</b> since he is entitled to it.",
    "<b>And</b> also, <b>if</b> the injured party <b>said</b> to the court: <b>Fix a time for me to go to Eretz Yisrael</b> to present the case before ordained judges, <b>we fix</b> a time <b>for him</b> and require the owner of the belligerent animal to go to the court in Eretz Yisrael at that time. <b>And</b> if <b>he does not go, we excommunicate him</b> for disobeying the orders of the court.",
    "<b>And either way, we excommunicate</b> the owner of the belligerent animal <b>until he removes the danger,</b> e.g., by killing the animal or otherwise neutralizing the danger.",
    "The justification for this is <b>from</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? The verse states: “You shall not bring blood into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8), i.e., one may not allow a hazardous situation or item to remain in one’s house. As long as the hazard remains, the owner is in violation of this verse and therefore the court may excommunicate him for failing to remove the danger.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts that an animal can perform twice and remain <b>innocuous</b> even when its owner was warned each time to prevent it from doing so. After the third time, the animal is rendered forewarned. In such cases, the owner is liable to pay only half of the damages. <b>And</b> there are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts for which an animal is considered <b>forewarned,</b> at times even if it had never caused damage in that manner. In such cases the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage.",
    "<b>An animal is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to Goring, i.e., <b>not for goring</b> with its horns, <b>nor for pushing</b> with its body, <b>nor for biting, nor for crouching</b> upon items in order to damage them, <b>nor for kicking.</b> In these cases the animal is considered to be innocuous and its owner is liable for only half of the damages.",
    "Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the tooth,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to eating that which is fitting for it</b> to eat. Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the foot,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to breaking</b> items <b>while walking. And</b> there is <b>a forewarned ox,</b> which gored three times and each time his owner was warned to safeguard his ox from doing so. <b>And</b> there is <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party. <b>And</b> there is <b>the person,</b> i.e., any damage done by a person. In all of these cases the one who caused the damage is considered to be forewarned, resulting in the obligation to pay the full cost of the damage.",
    "The mishna presents the <i>halakha</i> for wild animals: <b>The wolf; the lion; the bear; the leopard; the <i>bardelas</i>,</b> the meaning of which the Gemara will discuss; <b>and the snake. These are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> even if they had never previously caused damage. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: When these</b> animals <b>are domesticated they are not</b> considered <b>forewarned. But the snake is always</b> considered <b>forewarned.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in its latter clause: Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the tooth,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to eating</b> that which is fitting for it to eat, we learn, <b>by inference, that we are dealing</b> throughout the mishna <b>with</b> cases of damage done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, as one is exempt from liability for acts of damage classified as Eating if they occur in the public domain. <b>And</b> yet the first clause <b>teaches: An animal is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to Goring. Stating that it is not forewarned indicates that the liability of its owner is limited only <b>with regard to paying the full</b> cost <b>of</b> the damage, <b>but</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> it that holds that when damage classified as Goring is done within the property of the injured party the owner of the belligerent animal is liable for only half of the damages? <b>It is the Rabbis, who say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical</b> behavior, done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>",
    "But then <b>say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, the next part of <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And</b> there is <b>a forewarned ox</b> that gored three times, and each time his owner was warned to safeguard his ox from doing so. <b>And</b> there is <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party. <b>And</b> there is <b>the person.</b> In these cases, the responsible party pays full damages. With this clause <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical,</b> done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> even if the ox is innocuous.",
    "The Gemara asks: Could it be that <b>the first</b> part of the latter <b>clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <b>Rabbis and</b> the next part of <b>the latter clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: Large-toothed one, leave the mishna and follow after me</b> and my interpretation that <b>the first</b> part of the latter <b>clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <b>Rabbis and</b> the next part of <b>the latter clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon.</b>",
    "The Gemara presents a different interpretation of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rav:</b>"
