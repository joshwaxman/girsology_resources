    "<b>A person</b> should <b>always enter</b> an unfamiliar city <b>at</b> a time of <b>good,</b> i.e., while it is light, as the Torah uses the expression “It is good” with regard to the creation of light (see Genesis 1:4). This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And</b> likewise, when one leaves a city <b>he</b> should <b>leave at</b> a time of <b>good,</b> meaning after sunrise the next morning, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning”</b> (Exodus 12:22).",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>plague in the city, gather your feet,</b> i.e., limit the time you spend out of the house, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning.” And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you;</b> hide yourself for a little moment, until the anger has passed by” (Isaiah 26:20). <b>And it says: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:25).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason for citing the additional verses introduced with the term: <b>And it says?</b> The first verse seems sufficient to teach the principle that one should not emerge from one’s house when there is a plague. The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> the first verse that states that none of you shall go out until morning, applies only <b>at night, but in the day</b> one may think that the principle does <b>not</b> apply, for this reason the Gemara teaches: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you.”</b>",
    "<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>where there is no fear inside,</b> which explains why it is preferable to remain indoors, <b>but where there is fear inside,</b> one might think that <b>when he goes out</b> and <b>sits among people in general company</b> it is <b>better,</b> therefore, the Gemara introduces the third verse and says: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror.”</b> This means that <b>although there is terror in the chambers, outside the sword will bereave,</b> so it is safer to remain indoors.",
    "<b>At a time</b> when there was a <b>plague, Rava would close the windows</b> of his house, <b>as it is written: “For death is come up into our windows”</b> (Jeremiah 9:20).",
    "<b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>famine in the city, spread your feet,</b> i.e., leave the city, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there”</b> (Genesis 12:10). <b>And it says: “If we say: We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there;</b> and if we sit here, we die also, now come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die” (II Kings 7:4).",
    "<b>What</b> is the reason for citing the second verse, introduced with the term: <b>And it says? And if you would say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> the principle of leaving the city, applies only <b>where there is no uncertainty</b> concerning <b>a life-threatening</b> situation, <b>but where there is uncertainty</b> concerning <b>a life-threatening</b> situation this principle does <b>not</b> apply, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: “Come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live;</b> and if they kill us, we shall but die.”",
    "<b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>a plague in the city, a person should not walk in the middle of the road, due to</b> the fact <b>that the Angel of Death walks in the middle of the road, as, since</b> in Heaven <b>they have given him permission</b> to kill within the city, <b>he goes openly</b> in the middle of the road. By contrast, if there is <b>peace</b> and quiet <b>in the city, do not walk on the sides of the road, as, since</b> the Angel of Death <b>does not have permission</b> to kill within the city, <b>he hides</b> himself <b>and walks</b> on the side of the road.",
    "<b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>a plague in the city, a person should not enter the synagogue alone, as the Angel of Death leaves his utensils there,</b> and for this reason it is a dangerous place. <b>And this matter,</b> the danger in the synagogue, applies only <b>when there are no children learning in</b> the synagogue, <b>and</b> there are <b>not ten</b> men <b>praying in it.</b> But if there are children learning or ten men praying there, it is not a dangerous place.",
    "<b>The Sages taught:</b> If the <b>dogs</b> in a certain place <b>are crying</b> for no reason, it is a sign that they feel the <b>Angel of Death has come to the city.</b> If the <b>dogs are playing,</b> it is a sign that they feel that <b>Elijah the prophet has come to the city. These matters</b> apply only <b>if there is no female</b> dog among them. If there is a female dog nearby, their crying or playing is likely due to her presence.",
    "§ <b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi sat before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa.</b> One <b>Sage said to</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <b>Let the Master say</b> words of <b><i>halakha</i>, and</b> the other <b>Sage said to</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <b>Let the Master say</b> words of <b><i>aggada</i>.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>began to say</b> words of <b><i>aggada</i> but</b> one <b>Sage did not let him,</b> so he <b>began to say</b> words of <b><i>halakha</i> but</b> the other <b>Sage did not let him.</b>",
    "Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>said to them: I will relate a parable. To what can this be compared?</b> It can be compared <b>to a man who has two wives, one young and one old. The young</b> wife <b>pulls out his white</b> hairs, so that her husband will appear younger. <b>The old</b> wife <b>pulls out his black</b> hairs so that he will appear older. And it <b>turns out</b> that he is <b>bald from here and from there,</b> i.e., completely bald, due to the actions of both of his wives.",
    "Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa continued and <b>said to them: If so, I will say to you a matter that is appropriate to both of you,</b> which contains both <i>halakha</i> and <i>aggada</i>. In the verse that states: <b>“If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns”</b> (Exodus 22:5), the term <b>“breaks out”</b> indicates that it breaks out <b>by itself.</b> Yet, the continuation of the verse states: <b>“The one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation,”</b> which indicates that he must pay only if the fire spread due to his negligence. The verse can be explained allegorically: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said</b> that although the fire broke out in the Temple due to the sins of the Jewish people, <b>it is incumbent upon Me to pay</b> restitution <b>for the fire that I kindled.</b>",
    "<b>I,</b> God, <b>kindled a fire in Zion, as it is stated:</b> “The Lord has accomplished His fury, He has poured out His fierce anger; <b>and He has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations”</b> (Lamentations 4:11). <b>And I will build it with fire</b> in the <b>future, as it is stated: “For I,</b> says the Lord, <b>will be for her a wall of fire round about; and I will be the glory in her midst”</b> (Zechariah 2:9).",
    "There is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> that can be learned from the verse in Exodus, as <b>the verse begins with damage</b> caused through one’s <b>property:</b> “If a fire breaks out,” <b>and concludes with damage</b> caused by <b>one’s body:</b> “The one who kindled the fire.” This indicates that when damage is caused by fire, it is considered as though the person who kindled the fire caused the damage directly with his body. That serves <b>to say to you</b> that the liability for <b>his fire</b> damage is <b>due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows.</b> Just as one who shoots an arrow and causes damage is liable because the damage was caused directly through his action, so too, one who kindles a fire that causes damage is liable because it is considered as though the damage were caused directly by his actions.",
    "§ The Gemara continues with another statement of <i>aggada</i> on a related topic: The verse states: <b>“And David longed, and said: Oh, that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,</b> and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord” (II Samuel 23:15–16). The Sages understood that David was not simply asking for water, but was using the term as a metaphor referring to Torah, and he was raising a halakhic dilemma.",
    "<b>What is the dilemma</b> that David <b>is raising? Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: He was asking</b> about the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire.</b> He wanted to know whether the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that one is liable to pay for such damage, or <b>whether</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one is exempt from liability for damage by fire to concealed articles. <b>And</b> the Sages in Bethlehem <b>answered him what they answered him.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Huna stated</b> a different explanation of the verse: <b>There were stacks of barley belonging to Jews in which the Philistines were hiding, and</b> David wanted to burn down the stacks to kill the Philistines and save his own life. <b>He raised the dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted <b>to save oneself</b> by destroying <b>the property of another?</b>",
    "<b>They sent</b> the following answer <b>to him: It is prohibited to save oneself</b> by destroying <b>the property of another. But you are king, and a king may breach the fence</b> of an individual <b>in order to form a path for himself, and none may protest his</b> action, i.e., the normal <i>halakhot</i> of damage do not apply to you since you are king.",
    "<b>The Rabbis, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabba bar Mari,</b> give an alternative explanation of the dilemma and <b>said: The stacks of barley belonged to Jews, and</b> there were <b>stacks of lentils belonging to the Philistines.</b> David needed barley to feed his animals. <b>And</b> David <b>raised the</b> following <b>dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? I know that I may take the lentils belonging to a gentile to feed my animals, but is it permitted <b>to take a stack of barley</b> belonging to <b>a Jew, to place before one’s animal</b> for it to consume, <b>with the intent to pay</b> the owner of the barley with the <b>stacks of lentils belonging to the Philistines?</b>",
    "The Sages of Bethlehem <b>sent</b> the following reply <b>to him: “If the wicked restore the pledge, give back that which he had taken by robbery,</b> walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die” (Ezekiel 33:15). This verse teaches that <b>even though</b> the robber <b>repays</b> the value of the <b>stolen item, he</b> is nevertheless considered to be <b>wicked,</b> and is described as such in the verse, and a commoner would not be allowed to act as you asked. <b>But you are king, and a king may breach the fence</b> of an individual <b>in order to form a path for himself, and none may protest his</b> action.",
    "The Gemara discusses the different explanations: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that David was asking whether he could take the stacks of barley and <b>exchange</b> them, i.e., repay the owners of the barley, with stacks of lentils, <b>this is as it is written</b> in <b>one verse:</b> “And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, <b>where was a plot of ground full of lentils;</b> and the people fled from the Philistines” (II Samuel 23:11), <b>and it is written</b> in <b>one</b> other <b>verse:</b> “He was with David at Pas Dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, <b>where was a plot of ground full of barley;</b> and the people fled from before the Philistines” (I Chronicles 11:13). This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by saying that there were two fields, one of barley and one of lentils.",
    "<b>But according to</b> Rav Huna, <b>the one who says</b> that David’s question was asked because he wanted <b>to burn</b> the stacks of barley, for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does he require these two verses?</b> How does he explain this contradiction? Rav Huna could have <b>said to you that there were also stacks of lentils belonging to Jews, inside which the Philistines were hiding.</b>",
    "<b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that David asked his question because he wanted <b>to burn</b> the stacks, <b>this is as it is written</b> in the following verse with regard to David: <b>“But he stood in the midst of the plot, and saved it,</b> and slew the Philistines; and the Lord performed a great victory” (II Samuel 23:12). <b>But according to the one who says</b> that David’s question was asked <b>with regard to exchanging</b> the lentils for the barley, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“And saved it”?</b>",
    "The Rabbis answer that David saved it in <b>that he did not permit them to exchange</b> the value of the barley with the lentils.",
    "<b>Granted,</b> according to both of <b>these two</b> opinions, <b>this is as it is written</b> in <b>two</b> distinct <b>verses,</b> one describing the field of lentils and one describing the field of barley."
