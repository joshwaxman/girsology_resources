    "The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>was not</b> present <b>in court</b> when Rabban Gamliel encountered him.",
    "The Gemara asks a question from a different source: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Your statement is nothing, as you have already admitted</b> to inflicting the injury yourself? This indicates that even if witnesses would subsequently testify about the injury, Rabban Gamliel would not emancipate Tavi.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that the difference between these two <i>baraitot</i> <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? This <i>tanna</i></b> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>who says</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement was: <b>As you have no witnesses, holds</b> that one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is liable</b> to pay the fine if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. <b>And that <i>tanna</i></b> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>who says</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement was: <b>As you have already admitted, holds</b> that one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from payment, even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability.",
    "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No;</b> it is possible to understand the <i>baraitot</i> differently. <b>Everyone agrees</b> that one who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt,</b> even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. <b>And they disagree with regard to</b> the following: <b>This <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua said: <b>As you have no witnesses, holds that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>was outside the court</b> when Rabban Gamliel encountered him, and therefore his admission is disregarded. <b>And that <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua said: <b>As you have already admitted, holds</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua <b>was in the court</b> when Rabban Gamliel met him, so Rabban Gamliel’s admission is a valid admission.",
    "The Gemara analyzes in detail the dispute alluded to above: <b>It was stated</b> with regard to one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine, and afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability, that <b>Rav says</b> he is <b>exempt, and Shmuel says</b> he is <b>liable.</b>",
    "<b>Rava bar Ahilai said: What is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>Rav?</b> With regard to theft, which is subject to a fine of double payment, the Torah states: “If the theft shall be found in his possession alive, whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). The verb for “shall be found” is doubled, as the verse states “<i>himmatze timmatze</i>.” Rav derives from the repetition that there are two matters that are found: The double payment is imposed only <b>if it is found</b> [<i>himmatze</i>], i.e., it is revealed that he stole the item, <b>through</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses,</b> and the theft <b>is found</b> [<i>timmatze</i>], as determined <b>through judges.</b> This <b>excludes one who incriminates himself</b> through his own admission.",
    "Rav asks: But <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to teach this here? This principle is already <b>derived from</b> a different source: <b>“The one whom the judges convict</b> shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8), which indicates that self-incrimination is insufficient to render one liable for double payment. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> the fact that there are two verses to serve as the source for this principle that one who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from paying even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. The second verse teaches this additional novelty.",
    "<b>And Shmuel</b> would explain the double expression differently. He could have <b>said to you: That</b> verse <b>is necessary to</b> teach that <b>a thief himself</b> must pay double payment, i.e., the double payment is imposed not only upon a bailee who takes a false oath that the article entrusted to him was stolen, but it is also imposed upon a thief, <b>as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> earlier in this chapter (63b).",
    "<b>Rav raised an objection to Shmuel</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If a thief <b>saw witnesses who were approaching</b> with the intent to testify against him, <b>and</b> at that point <b>he said:</b> I admit that <b>I stole</b> an animal, <b>but I did not slaughter or sell</b> it, <b>he pays only the principal.</b> This indicates that even if those witnesses subsequently testify, the thief remains exempt from the double payment as well as the fourfold or fivefold payment. Shmuel <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? With a case <b>where the witnesses returned back,</b> i.e., ultimately they did not testify.",
    "Rav raised an objection: <b>But</b> this interpretation is impossible, as can be seen <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Let the witnesses come and testify.</b> This means that their testimony will be accepted and the thief will be required to pay the relevant fines. <b>By inference</b> it may be deduced <b>that the first <i>tanna</i></b> holds that <b>no,</b> there is no point in the witnesses testifying, as the thief will be exempt in any case.",
    "<b>Shmuel said to</b> Rav: <b>Isn’t there</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, which stands in accordance with my</b> opinion? When I said that one who admits that he is liable to pay a fine and afterward witnesses testified that he committed that act is deemed liable, <b>I said</b> this ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>According to Shmuel,</b> his opinion on this matter <b>is certainly</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as he himself was forced to admit that his opinion is in accordance only with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, not that of the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>. But <b>according to Rav, shall we say</b> that his opinion too <b>is</b> necessarily subject to this dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I say</b> my opinion in accordance with the rulings of both <i>tanna’im</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says</b> that the testimony of the witnesses obligates the thief to pay a fine even after his admission <b>only there,</b> in that specific case, <b>because</b> the thief <b>admitted</b> his guilt solely <b>due to</b> his <b>fear</b> of the impending testimony <b>of the witnesses. But here,</b> in an ordinary case of admission, <b>where</b> there is no impending testimony to incriminate him, and <b>he admits</b> his guilt <b>of his own</b> volition, <b>even Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> would <b>concede</b> that the thief is exempt from payment even if witnesses subsequently testify that he is liable.",
    "<b>Rav Hamnuna said: Rav’s statement is</b> more <b>reasonable</b> in a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>says: I stole</b> an item, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he stole</b> that item. In that case it is logical that the thief is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine despite the witnesses’ testimony, because he at least <b>obligated himself to</b> pay <b>the principal</b> amount via his admission.",
    "<b>But</b> if <b>he says: I did not steal</b> anything, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he did steal</b> an animal, <b>and subsequently</b> the thief <b>says:</b> Yes, I did steal the animal, and <b>I</b> also <b>slaughtered</b> it, <b>or</b> I also <b>sold</b> it, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he slaughtered or sold</b> it, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. The reason he is liable is <b>that</b> through his admission he sought to <b>exempt himself from any</b> payment whatsoever. In order for an admission to exempt the perpetrator from a fine, it must include an admission that he is liable to pay some payment.",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> In this case <b>I have gotten the better [<i>kipaḥti</i>] of the elders of the school of Rav,</b> which is a reference to Rav Hamnuna. The reason is <b>that</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that discusses <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> injuring his slave, he <b>was</b> seeking to <b>exempt himself from any payment</b> whatsoever through his admission, <b>and</b> yet earlier in the Gemara it was said that <b>Rav Ḥisda stated</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to Rav Huna</b> to challenge Rav Huna’s opinion, <b>and</b> Rav Huna <b>did not answer him</b> that Rabban Gamliel’s case was different because his admission served to exempt him entirely.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> the same opinion as Rav Hamnuna. If a thief says: <b>I stole</b> an item, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he stole</b> that item, the thief is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine despite the witnesses’ testimony, because he at least <b>obligates himself,</b> through his admission, <b>to</b> pay <b>the principal. But</b> if <b>he says: I did not steal</b> anything, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he did steal</b> an animal, <b>and subsequently</b> the thief <b>says:</b> Yes, I did steal the animal, and <b>I</b> also <b>slaughtered</b> it, <b>or</b> I also <b>sold</b> it, and then <b>witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he slaughtered or sold</b> it, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>as</b> through his admission <b>he was</b> seeking to <b>exempt himself from any</b> payment whatsoever.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> There is <b>a mishna and a <i>baraita</i></b> that are <b>also precisely</b> formulated in accordance with this opinion. <b>The mishna</b> is <b>as we learned</b> (74b): If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the stolen animal, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment, but he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>",
    "<b>Why do I</b> need the mishna to <b>teach</b> in the beginning of this case: If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses? <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the case more simply: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and</b> then <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, <b>he pays only the principal.</b> This would serve to teach the same principle in a less complicated manner, without the need for two additional witnesses."
