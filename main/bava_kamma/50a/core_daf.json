    "in the case <b>where</b> one dug <b>the pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> and then renounced ownership of the surrounding area. Consequently, the entire area except for the pit is now open to public passage. In this case, <b>Rabbi Akiva maintains</b> that one who digs <b>a pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> is <b>also liable,</b> not only when the pit is located in the public domain, <b>as it is written: “The owner of the pit</b> shall pay” (Exodus 21:34). Clearly, <b>the Merciful One is referring to a pit that has an owner.</b> Therefore, the owner of the pit pays even if it is located on private property.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that “the owner of the pit” means that <b>the one responsible for the hazard</b> is liable even if he dug the pit in the public domain and then renounced ownership of it. But one who digs a pit on his own property is not liable.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather,</b> according to Rabba’s explanation, <b>what</b> is meant by the clause: <b>This is</b> the case of <b>Pit that is stated in the Torah,</b> in reference to digging a pit on one’s property, <b>that Rabbi Akiva states?</b> According to him, one is liable for damage in all cases, including digging in the public domain. The Gemara answers: It means that <b>this is the pit</b> with <b>which the verse initially introduces</b> the subject <b>of compensation</b> for damage caused. In that context, the Torah states: “The owner of the pit shall pay” (Exodus 21:34), indicating that even a pit owned on one’s private property renders one liable.",
    "<b>And Rav Yosef said</b> that one can explain the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva differently: <b>With regard to</b> one who dug <b>a pit on</b> his <b>private property</b> and then renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, <b>everyone agrees that he is liable. What is the reason?</b> Since <b>the Merciful One states: “The owner of the pit,”</b> it indicates that <b>we are dealing with a pit that has an owner.</b>",
    "<b>When they disagree,</b> it is in a case <b>where the pit</b> was dug <b>in the public domain. Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that one is <b>also liable</b> for <b>a pit</b> dug <b>in the public domain, as it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit,” and: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), which raises the question: <b>If</b> he is <b>liable for opening</b> a pit by removing the cover of a pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? <b>Rather,</b> the verse means that the responsibility for the pit <b>comes to him by engaging in opening</b> the pit <b>and by engaging in digging</b> the pit. Although he does not own the area itself, he is liable for creating a public hazard.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> by contrast, holds that one is liable only in the case of a pit located on private property, where he renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, and one cannot derive otherwise from any extraneous phrases. This is because <b>these</b> phrases <b>are necessary, for if the Merciful One wrote</b> only: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), <b>I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically when <b>one opens</b> the covering of a pit that has already been dug <b>that it is sufficient for him to</b> place <b>a covering</b> on it to absolve himself of responsibility for damage it causes. This is the case where the Torah states: “And not cover it” (Exodus 21:33). But if one actually <b>digs</b> a pit, it <b>would not be sufficient</b> to place <b>a covering</b> on it, and one would not be exempt from damages <b>unless he</b> completely <b>packs it.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig,” I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically in a case of <b>digging that a covering is required</b> to exempt one from liability, <b>because he performed an action</b> of creating the pit. <b>But</b> for merely <b>opening</b> it, <b>where one has not performed an action, say</b> that he <b>does not require a covering</b> to absolve him of liability. Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us</b> that he is liable for damage caused by a pit in both cases, and one should interpret the verse that states: “The owner of the pit” (Exodus 21:34), in its plain sense, i.e., that he is the owner of the pit because it is located on his private property. Accordingly, one would not be liable for a pit dug in the public domain.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But rather,</b> according to Rav Yosef’s explanation, <b>what</b> is meant by the clause: <b>This is</b> the case of <b>Pit that is stated in the Torah,</b> in reference to digging a pit in the public domain, <b>that Rabbi Yishmael states?</b> Isn’t one liable for any pit, including one dug on his own property? The Gemara answers: It means that <b>this is the pit</b> with <b>which the verse initially introduces</b> the subject <b>of damage</b> caused by Pit, as explained by Rabbi Yishmael above. Only afterward does it state: “The owner of the pit shall pay,” referring to a pit dug on one’s own property.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who digs a pit</b> whose hollow space is <b>in the public domain and</b> then <b>opens its</b> entrance <b>into private property</b> is <b>exempt, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though he does not have permission to do so.</b> The reason he does not have permission to do so is <b>that one may not create a hollow</b> space <b>under the public domain.</b>",
    "<b>One who digs pits, ditches, and caves on private property and</b> then <b>opens their</b> entrances <b>into the public domain</b> is <b>liable.</b> In addition, one <b>who digs pits on private property that is adjacent to the public domain</b> but not actually located in the public domain itself, <b>such as these</b> people <b>who dig foundations [<i>ushin</i>]</b> for their houses or walls, is <b>exempt. But Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems</b> one <b>liable</b> even for damage caused by pits made to lay foundations, <b>unless he builds a partition</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths high in front of the pits, <b>or unless he distances</b> them by <b>four handbreadths from the area where pedestrians walk and from the area where animals walk.</b>",
    "The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> for the exemption is that one digs <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>foundations,</b> which is the usual and accepted practice, <b>but</b> if he did <b>not</b> dig <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>foundations,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> Although he did so on his own property, he is nevertheless liable, since people walk there.",
    "The Gemara clarifies: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>Granted, according to Rabba, the first clause,</b> where one is seemingly exempt for opening a pit onto private property even if he subsequently renounced ownership of the area, can be established in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and the last clause</b> can be established in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who maintains that one is liable for a pit dug on his own property if it is open to public traffic.",
    "<b>But according to Rav Yosef’s</b> explanation, <b>granted,</b> with regard to <b>the last clause, all agree</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the first clause,</b> which exempts one who digs a pit on his own property, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this?</b> It appears to be <b>neither</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yishmael nor</b> that of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> since Rav Yosef explained that both of them maintain that one is liable for a pit on his own property, even if he subsequently renounces ownership of the area.",
    "The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yosef</b> could have <b>said to you: Everyone agrees</b> with the <b>entire</b> passage. As for <b>the first clause,</b> which exempts one who digs a pit under the public domain and opens it onto his own property, it is referring to a case <b>where one did not renounce ownership of either his property or his pit.</b> This certainly is not included in the category of Pit with regard to damages, and the owner is therefore exempt.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said: Now that you have interpreted Rav Yosef’s</b> explanation of the <i>baraita</i> as being <b>in accordance with all</b> opinions, then <b>also according to Rabba,</b> you are <b>not</b> required to <b>establish it as</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>",
    "Rather, one can say that <b>since the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who exempts one who renounces ownership of his property but not the pit, <b>the last clause</b> can <b>also</b> be explained in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael. And</b> it was previously inferred that <b>the reason</b> for the exemption when digging on one’s private property adjacent to the public domain is that one digs <b>to</b> lay <b>foundations. But</b> if it is <b>not to</b> lay <b>foundations,</b> one is <b>liable. For instance,</b> in a case <b>where one widened</b> the pit unnecessarily, extending it <b>into the public domain,</b> he has effectively dug a pit in the public domain itself.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>who digs a pit on private property and opens it into the public domain</b> is <b>liable.</b> But if he dug it <b>on private property that was adjacent to the public domain,</b> he is <b>exempt. Granted, according to Rabba,</b> this mishna is <b>entirely</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who does not hold one liable for digging on his own property. <b>But according to Rav Yosef, granted, the first clause</b> works out well in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds one liable even for digging in the public domain, <b>but whose</b> opinion is <b>the latter clause?</b> It appears to be <b>neither</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yishmael nor</b> that of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers that Rav Yosef could have <b>said to you:</b> The latter clause of this <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>digs to</b> lay <b>foundations, and</b> therefore <b>all agree</b> with the ruling.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If someone <b>dug or opened</b> a well <b>and transferred</b> it <b>to the public</b> for their use, he is <b>exempt</b> from damage caused by the well. If <b>he dug or opened</b> a well <b>and did not transfer</b> it <b>to the public,</b> he is <b>liable. And this</b> was <b>the practice of Neḥunya the digger of pits, ditches, and caves, who would dig, open, and transfer</b> them <b>to the public</b> so that there would be wells of water for public use. <b>When the Sages heard about the matter, they said: This</b> individual <b>has fulfilled this <i>halakha</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: Only <b>this <i>halakha</i> and no more?</b> Isn’t it well known that Neḥunya was a great man? <b>Rather, say:</b> He fulfilled <b>even this <i>halakha</i></b> and did not forget to transfer the wells to the public.",
    "Having mentioned the deeds of Neḥunya, the Gemara relates that <b>the Sages taught: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving the daughter of Neḥunya the ditchdigger, where she fell into a large cistern</b> and no one could extricate her from it. <b>They came and informed Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa</b> so that he would pray on her behalf. When <b>the first hour</b> had passed from the time of her fall, <b>he said to them:</b> She is at <b>peace</b> and unharmed. After the <b>second</b> hour, <b>he said to them:</b> She is at <b>peace.</b> After the <b>third</b> hour, <b>he said to them: She has ascended</b> from the well, and indeed this was the case.",
    "<b>They said to her: Who brought you up</b> out of the well? <b>She said to them: A male sheep,</b> i.e., a ram, <b>happened</b> to come <b>to me, and a certain old man,</b> i.e., Abraham, <b>was leading it,</b> and he pulled me out. <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa: <b>Are you a prophet?</b> How did you know she had ascended? Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa <b>said to them: “I am no prophet, neither am I a prophet’s son”</b> (Amos 7:14), <b>but this</b> is what <b>I said</b> to myself: <b>Shall the offspring</b> of Neḥunya <b>stumble by means of</b> the very <b>matter which distressed that righteous man?</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Aḥa says:</b> Although Neḥunya ensured that others would have water, <b>even so, his son died of thirst,</b> fulfilling that which <b>is stated: “And around Him it storms [<i>nisara</i>] mightily”</b> (Psalms 50:3). This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is scrupulous with those around Him,</b> i.e., the righteous, <b>even</b> to the extent <b>of a hairsbreadth [<i>hasa’ara</i>],</b> so that even minor transgressions elicit a severe punishment. <b>Rabbi Neḥunya says:</b> The same idea may be learned <b>from here,</b> in the following verse: <b>“A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all those that surround Him”</b> (Psalms 89:8), indicating that God is most careful and exacting with those that surround Him, i.e., the righteous.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Anyone who states</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, is forgiving [<i>vateran</i>]</b> of transgressions, <b>his life will be relinquished [<i>yivatru</i>], as it is stated: “The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:4). In other words, God does not waive heavenly justice. <b>Rabbi Ḥana says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> says: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b>"
