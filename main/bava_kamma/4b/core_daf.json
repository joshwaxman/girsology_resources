    "§ <b>Rav Mari objects to</b> the Gemara’s initial suggestion that the dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to the meaning of <i>Maveh</i> is based on biblical terms with similar etymology. He suggests: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b><i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is <b>the</b> primary category of damage caused by <b>water, as it is written: “As when fire ignites brushwood; fire boils [<i>tiveh</i>] water”</b> (Isaiah 64:1). The terms <i>tiveh</i> and <i>maveh</i> share a common root, and the reference is to water. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written</b> in the verse: <b>Water boils [<i>nivu</i>]</b> from fire, with water, a plural noun in Hebrew, the subject of the intransitive plural verb, <i>nivu</i>? No, <b>“fire boils [<i>tiveh</i>] water” is written,</b> and since <i>tiveh</i> is a transitive singular verb, the subject is fire, which is a singular noun. Therefore, no proof can be adduced from this verse that <i>Maveh</i> refers to an action performed with water.",
    "<b>Rav Zevid objects to</b> the Gemara’s initial suggestion that the dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to the meaning of <i>Maveh</i> is based on biblical terms with similar etymology. He suggests: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b><i>Maveh</i>, this is the</b> primary category of <b>Fire, as when</b> the term <b>“<i>tiveh</i>” is written</b> in the verse cited by Rav Mari, <b>it is written with regard to Fire.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when the mishna enumerates the primary categories of damage: <b>The</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i> and the</b> category of <b>Fire,</b> indicating that they are two distinct categories? <b>And if you would say</b> that these are not two distinct categories but rather the mishna <b>is explaining</b> the meaning of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>if so,</b> why does the mishna say: There are <b>four</b> primary categories of damage? <b>There are</b> only <b>three.</b>",
    "<b>And if you would say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> is Fire, and there are four categories in the mishna, as the mishna <b>teaches</b> the primary category of <b>Ox, in which there are two</b> primary categories of damage, Eating and Trampling, the mishna remains difficult. <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that <i>Maveh</i> in the mishna is referring to Fire, what is the meaning of that which the mishna states with regard to the common denominator of <i>Maveh</i> and Ox: <b>And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> category of Ox <b>and that</b> category of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>in which there is a living spirit,</b> are <b>not</b> similar to the defining characteristic of the next category in the mishna, in which there is no living spirit. Accordingly, how can <i>Maveh</i> mean Fire; <b>what living spirit is there in Fire? And furthermore,</b> if <i>Maveh</i> is Fire, what is the meaning of the next phrase in the mishna: They <b>are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire,</b> in which there is no living spirit. Clearly, <i>Maveh</i> is not Fire.",
    "§ Contrary to the mishna, where four primary categories of damage were enumerated, <b>Rabbi Oshaya taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1) that there are <b>thirteen primary categories of damage.</b> The thirteen categories consist of four bailees, five types of indemnity, and the four primary categories listed in the mishna. The four bailees are: The <b>unpaid bailee,</b> who is liable for damage caused by his negligence; <b>and the borrower,</b> who is liable for all damage; the <b>paid bailee, and the renter,</b> who is liable if the object is lost or stolen. The five types of indemnity one is liable to pay for injuring another person are: <b>Damage,</b> i.e., the decrease in the injured party’s value; <b>pain; and medical costs; loss of livelihood; and humiliation</b> that the injured party suffered from the assault. <b>And</b> with <b>the four</b> primary categories enumerated in <b>the mishna, that</b> is a total of <b>thirteen.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>does not teach these</b> nine categories and enumerates only four? <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> who says that <i>Maveh</i> is Eating, it is <b>with regard to</b> the categories of <b>damage</b> caused by one’s <b>property</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>speaks. With regard to</b> categories of <b>damage</b> caused by <b>one’s body,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>does not speak,</b> and the additional categories of Rabbi Oshaya are damage caused by one’s body. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> who says that <i>Maveh</i> is Man, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teach</b> these nine categories as well. The Gemara answers: According to Rav, the mishna <b>teaches</b> the primary category of <b>Man, and</b> included in that category are <b>all matters</b> of damage that are caused by <b>man,</b> among them the categories added by Rabbi Oshaya.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Oshaya too, doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the primary category of <b>Man?</b> Why then did he enumerate the four bailees and the five types of indemnity? The Gemara answers: In his enumeration, Rabbi Oshaya distinguishes between <b>two types of</b> damage caused by <b>a man:</b> He <b>teaches</b> cases involving <b>a man who injures</b> another <b>person, and</b> he <b>teaches</b> the primary category of <i>Maveh</i>, which involves the cases of <b>a man who damages an ox</b> or damages other property belonging to another person.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>Ox as well, let him teach two categories of Ox. Let him teach</b> the case of <b>an ox that damages an ox</b> or other property belonging to another person, <b>and let him teach</b> the case of <b>an ox that injures a person.</b>",
    "The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted,</b> in the case of <b>a man who damages</b> another’s <b>ox</b> or other property, <b>he pays</b> merely for the <b>damage;</b> in the case of <b>a man who injures</b> another <b>person, he pays</b> an additional <b>four types</b> of indemnity payments: Pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation. <b>But</b> with regard to damage caused by <b>an ox, what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if it is <b>an ox that damages an ox</b> or other property belonging to another person and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if it is <b>an ox that injures a person?</b> In both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> merely for the <b>damage.</b> Therefore, unlike a case where a person causes the damage, there is no reason to distinguish between cases where an ox causes damage based on the victim of that damage.",
    "With regard to the assertion that Rabbi Oshaya added only cases involving a man who injures another person, the Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t</b> there the categories of the <b>unpaid bailee and the borrower,</b> the <b>paid bailee and the renter, which are</b> categories that describe <b>a man who damages</b> another’s <b>ox</b> or other property, as the cases referred to by Rabbi Oshaya are those where the bailee fails to return the deposit that he was entrusted to safeguard? <b>And</b> yet Rabbi Oshaya <b>teaches</b> each type of bailee as distinct categories and does not include them under the rubric of Man, one of the four categories enumerated in the mishna.",
    "The Gemara answers that the reason why Rabbi Oshaya enumerates Man separately from the bailees is that he <b>teaches</b> one category, Man, referring to <b>damage that</b> is engendered <b>by</b> direct <b>action,</b> e.g., the five types of indemnity payments, <b>and</b> he <b>teaches</b> the four bailees, referring to <b>damage that occurs on its own,</b> e.g., failure of the four bailees to safeguard the deposit.",
    "The Gemara cites a third listing of primary categories of damage. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> that there are <b>twenty-four primary categories of damage: Payment of double</b> the principal, paid by a thief who is apprehended and convicted based on the testimony of witnesses and who does not admit his crime; <b>and payment of four or five</b> times the principal, paid by a thief who steals an ox or sheep, respectively, and then slaughters or sells it; <b>and</b> payment of the principal, by <b>a thief</b> who admits his crime; <b>and a robber, who</b> steals openly and by force or threat of violence; <b>and conspiring witnesses</b> who pay the individual against whom they falsely testified with regard to a sum that they conspired to cause him to lose.",
    "<b>And the rapist, and the seducer,</b> who seduces an unmarried young woman, who pay a fine of fifty <i>sela</i>; <b>and the defamer,</b> i.e., one who defames his wife by claiming falsely in court that he discovered that she was not a virgin when he consummated the marriage and alleges that she engaged in intercourse with another man while betrothed, who pays a fine of one hundred <i>sela</i>; <b>and one who causes</b> another’s <i>teruma</i> <b>to become ritually impure,</b> rendering it prohibited to partake of that <i>teruma</i>; <b>and one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred food, rendering it prohibited for any non-priest to partake of it; <b>and one who pours</b> another’s wine <b>as a libation</b> for idolatry. When one combines the eleven categories enumerated by <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and these thirteen</b> categories enumerated by Rabbi Oshaya, <b>this</b> totals <b>twenty-four</b> principal categories of damage.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Oshaya, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not teach these</b> eleven additional categories? The Gemara answers: It is <b>with regard to</b> cases where one is liable to pay <b>monetary restitution</b> that Rabbi Oshaya <b>speaks. With regard to</b> cases where one is liable to pay <b>a fine,</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>does not speak.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: What of the cases of <b>a thief and a robber, which</b> are cases where one is liable to pay <b>monetary restitution? Let</b> Rabbi Oshaya also <b>teach</b> those cases and include them in his list. The Gemara answers: <b>Doesn’t he teach</b> those cases, as he enumerates in his list the <b>unpaid bailee and the borrower?</b> An unpaid bailee who takes a false oath that the deposit was stolen, when in fact it remained in his possession, is liable to pay restitution like a thief.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya too, doesn’t he teach</b> those cases; as he enumerates in his list the <b>unpaid bailee and the borrower?</b> Why does Rabbi Ḥiyya list them separately? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ḥiyya makes a distinction between different types of theft: He <b>teaches</b> cases of theft with regard to <b>property that came into</b> one’s <b>possession in a permitted</b> manner, e.g., an unpaid bailee who was entrusted with a deposit and later misappropriated it, <b>and</b> he <b>teaches</b> cases of theft with regard to <b>property that came into</b> one’s <b>possession in a prohibited</b> manner, e.g., the actions of a thief and a robber."
