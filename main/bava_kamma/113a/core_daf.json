    "<b>But</b> if the defendant <b>is in the city,</b> the court does <b>not</b> ostracize him for failing to respond to a summons conveyed through a woman or a neighbor, <b>as we say:</b> Perhaps <b>they did not tell him</b> of the court’s summons, <b>as they said</b> to themselves: Since the defendant is in the city, <b>a court agent</b> has already <b>found him and told him.</b> As a result, these unofficial messengers will not deliver the court’s summons to the defendant at all.",
    "<b>And</b> similarly, <b>we said</b> that the court will ostracize one who does not respond to a summons conveyed through a woman or a neighbor <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he does not pass by the court’s entrance</b> on his way home, <b>but</b> if he does <b>pass by the court’s entrance,</b> the court does <b>not</b> ostracize him. This is because it is possible that the unofficial messengers will <b>say</b> to themselves: Since he passes by the courthouse, <b>the court</b> has already <b>found him and told him.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we said</b> that the court will ostracize one who does not respond to a summons <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he comes</b> home <b>on the</b> same <b>day</b> that the woman or neighbor is sent to deliver the court summons. <b>But</b> if he does <b>not come</b> home <b>on the</b> same <b>day,</b> he is <b>not</b> ostracized, because it is possible to <b>say</b> that <b>they forgot</b> to notify him.",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one</b> who had <b>a document of ostracism written about him due to</b> the fact that <b>he did not come to court, we do not tear up the document for him until he</b> actually <b>comes to court,</b> and it is not enough for him to simply commit to appearing. Similarly, if the document of ostracism was written <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>he did not obey</b> the ruling of <b>the court, we do not tear it up for him until he</b> actually <b>obeys</b> the ruling. The Gemara comments: This second statement <b>is not so.</b> Rather, <b>once he</b> has acquiesced and <b>said: I will obey, we</b> immediately <b>tear up the document for him.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The court <b>sets a date</b> for an individual to appear in court on the upcoming <b>Monday. And</b> if he does not appear, they set a date for that <b>Thursday, and</b> if he does not appear, they set a date for the following <b>Monday,</b> so that he has a second <b>date and</b> then a third <b>date after</b> the first <b>date. And</b> if he does not appear in court by the third date, then <b>on the next day we write</b> a document of ostracism.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Asi happened</b> to come to <b>the house of Rav Kahana. He saw</b> that there was <b>a certain woman whom</b> Rav Kahana had <b>summoned to</b> appear in <b>court in the evening,</b> but she did not appear, <b>and in the morning</b> Rav Kahana <b>wrote a document of ostracism concerning her.</b> Rav Asi said <b>to him:</b> Does <b>the Master not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that which Rav Ḥisda says,</b> that the court <b>sets a date</b> for the coming <b>Monday, and</b> then <b>Thursday, and</b> then the following <b>Monday</b> before it issues a document of ostracism?",
    "Rav Kahana <b>said to him: That matter</b> applies only with regard to <b>a man, as he is a victim of circumstance and is not</b> always <b>in the city</b> due to his vocational activities. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a woman, since she is</b> always <b>in the city,</b> when <b>she does not come</b> to court the first time <b>she is</b> immediately considered <b>rebellious,</b> and the court may issue a document of ostracism right away.",
    "Continuing the discussion of court dates, <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The court <b>does not set a date for</b> legal proceedings <b>during the days of Nisan, nor during the days of Tishrei,</b> and also <b>not on the eve of a Festival nor the eve of Shabbat</b> because these are busy times. <b>But during Nisan we may set</b> a court date to take place <b>after Nisan, and</b> likewise, <b>during Tishrei</b> we may set a court date to take place <b>after Tishrei.</b> By contrast, <b>on the eve of Shabbat we do not</b> set a court date to take place <b>after the eve of Shabbat. What is the reason</b> for this? It is because <b>one is preoccupied with his work</b> in preparation <b>for Shabbat</b> and it is possible that he will forget about the court summons.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman says: We do not set</b> a court <b>date for participants in the <i>kalla</i>,</b> the gatherings for Torah study during Elul and Adar, <b>during</b> the months of the <b><i>kalla</i>, nor for participants in</b> the public discourses prior to <b>the Festival during the</b> period leading up to <b>the Festival.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>When</b> people <b>would come before Rav Naḥman</b> during the <i>kalla</i> period in order to make legal claims against others, <b>he would say to them: Did I gather you</b> here <b>for your</b> own needs? No, I gathered you to participate in Torah study. The Gemara adds: <b>But now that there are scoundrels,</b> who do not come to study Torah but rather to avoid trial, <b>we are concerned</b> that they will continue to evade prosecution, and therefore we summon them to court even during these time periods.",
    "§ The mishna teaches, with regard to one who left a stolen item to his children, <b>if</b> the item <b>was something that may serve</b> as a legal <b>guarantee</b> of a loan, the heirs <b>are obligated to pay</b> the owner. The Gemara states that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would <b>teach</b> this mishna to <b>Rabbi Shimon, his son,</b> and explain that it does <b>not</b> refer only to <b>something that can actually</b> serve as <b>a guarantee</b> for a loan, i.e., land. <b>Rather,</b> it refers <b>even</b> to <b>a cow</b> that <b>he plows with,</b> or <b>a donkey</b> that <b>he drives</b> by directing it from <b>behind,</b> which the heirs <b>are obligated to return because of the honor of their father,</b> so that people will not continually point out that the inheritance was stolen and thereby disgrace their deceased parent.",
    "<b>Rav Kahana raises a dilemma before Rav:</b> If the robber left his heirs a stolen item that is used in relative privacy, such as <b>a bed that he lies on</b> or <b>a table upon which he eats,</b> rather than something as conspicuous as a large animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are the heirs obligated to return it to its owner? Rav <b>said to him: “Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser”</b> (Proverbs 9:9), meaning that from the fact that the heirs must return a cow and a donkey, one can infer that they must also return a bed and a table.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not exchange</b> larger coins for smaller ones <b>from the trunk of customs collectors nor from the purse of tax collectors, and one may not take charity from them,</b> as they are assumed to have obtained their funds illegally. <b>But one may take</b> money <b>from</b> the collector’s <b>house or from</b> money he has with him in <b>the market</b> that he did not take from his collection trunk or purse.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition against exchanging money from the trunk of a customs collector: <b>But one may give</b> the customs collector <b>a dinar</b> as payment for a debt that amounts to less than a dinar, <b>and</b> when the collector <b>gives him change,</b> he may accept it.",
    "It was taught in the mishna that one may not exchange money from the trunks of <b>customs collectors,</b> which are assumed to include stolen funds. The Gemara questions this ruling: <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>the law of the kingdom is the law,</b> i.e., <i>halakha</i> requires Jews to obey the laws of the state in which they live. Accordingly, the customs are collected legally and it should be permitted to make use of the funds.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna is discussing <b>a customs collector who does not have a limitation</b> placed by the governor on the amount he may collect, and he collects as he pleases. Alternatively, the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> The mishna is discussing <b>a customs collector who stands on his own,</b> i.e., he was not appointed by the government but, on his own, he forces people to give him money.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the statements of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana and the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yannai <b>with regard to this</b> following mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 9:2) and its attendant discussion. The customs collectors would not levy a duty for the garments one was wearing. In light of this, the mishna teaches: <b>A person may not wear</b> a garment made of <b>diverse kinds,</b> i.e., a combination of wool and linen, <b>even</b> if he wears it <b>on top of ten garments,</b> in order <b>to avoid</b> paying <b>customs.</b> It was noted that this <b>mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is prohibited to avoid</b> paying <b>customs</b> by wearing a garment of diverse kinds. <b>Rabbi Shimon says in the name of Rabbi Akiva: It is permitted to avoid</b> paying <b>customs</b> in this manner.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds, they disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>an unintentional act is permitted.</b> In this case, the prohibition is to benefit from wearing the garment, and that is not his intent, as his intention is merely to avoid paying the customs duties. Therefore, it is permitted. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>an unintentional act is prohibited. But is</b> it ever <b>permitted to avoid customs? Doesn’t Shmuel say: The law of the kingdom is the law?</b>",
    "In answer to this question, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The dispute in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>with regard to a customs collector who does not have a limitation</b> placed on the amount he may collect. Alternatively, Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> The dispute is <b>with regard to a customs collector who stands on his own,</b> i.e., who is self-appointed.",
    "The Gemara notes: <b>And there are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the statements of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana and the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yannai <b>with regard to this</b> mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 27b): One <b>may vow before murderers, plunderers, and customs collectors</b> in order to reinforce the claim <b>that</b> a certain item that is being commandeered <b>is <i>teruma</i>,</b> or that <b>it belongs to the king’s house,</b> and thereby avoid its seizure, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that it is not <i>teruma</i></b> or <b>that it does not belong to the king’s house.</b> It was asked: Can it be that it is permitted to pronounce such a vow <b>before customs collectors? But doesn’t Shmuel say: The law of the kingdom is the law?</b> It should therefore be prohibited to state such a vow before the customs collectors.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna in <i>Nedarim</i> issues its ruling <b>with regard to a customs collector who does not have a limitation</b> placed on the amount he may collect. Alternatively, the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> The mishna issues its ruling <b>with regard to a customs collector who stands on his own.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The mishna issues its ruling <b>with regard to a gentile customs collector,</b> whom one may deceive, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Jew and a gentile who approach</b> the court <b>for judgment</b> in a legal dispute, <b>if you can vindicate</b> the Jew <b>under Jewish law, vindicate him, and say to</b> the gentile: <b>This is our law.</b> If he can be vindicated <b>under gentile law, vindicate him, and say to</b> the gentile: <b>This is your law. And if</b> it is <b>not</b> possible to vindicate him under either system of law, <b>one approaches</b> the case <b>circuitously,</b> seeking a justification to vindicate the Jew. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva</b> disagrees and <b>says: One does not approach</b> the case <b>circuitously</b> in order to vindicate the Jew <b>due to the sanctification of God’s name,</b> as God’s name will be desecrated if the Jewish judge employs dishonest means.",
    "The Gemara infers from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> even according to <b>Rabbi Akiva, the reason</b> that the court does not employ trickery in order to vindicate the Jew is only <b>because there is</b> the consideration of <b>the sanctification of God’s name. Consequently,</b> if there <b>is no</b> consideration of <b>the sanctification of God’s name,</b> the court does <b>approach</b> the case circuitously. Apparently, it is permitted to deceive a gentile.",
    "The Gemara challenges this assertion: <b>But is robbery</b> from <b>a gentile permitted? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva taught this matter when he came from Zephirin: From where</b> is it derived that it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile?</b> It is from the fact that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a Jew who has been sold as a slave to a gentile: <b>“After he is sold he may be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 25:48),"
