    "<b>Come and let us go out to greet the bride, the queen. And some say</b> that this is what he would say: Come and let us go out <b>to greet Shabbat, the bride, the queen.

    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who was chopping</b> wood <b>in the public domain and</b> a chip flew off and <b>caused damage in</b> the <b>private property</b> of another person, or one who was chopping wood <b>in</b> his <b>private property and caused damage in the public domain,</b> or one who was chopping wood <b>in</b> his <b>private property</b> and <b>caused damage in</b> the <b>private property</b> of <b>another,</b> in all these cases he is <b>liable.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that he is liable in all these cases because in each one there is a novel element. <b>As if it had taught</b> only the case of <b>one who was chopping</b> wood <b>in</b> his <b>private property and caused damage in the public domain,</b> it might have been reasoned that he is liable, despite the fact that he was working in his private property, <b>because</b> it is <b>common</b> for the <b>multitudes</b> to be there. <b>But</b> if a chip flew <b>from the public domain to</b> another person’s <b>private property, where</b> it is <b>not common</b> for the <b>multitudes</b> to be, one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> liable. Therefore, it is necessary to teach this case as well.",
    "<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if it had taught</b> that he is liable where the chip flew <b>from the public domain to</b> another’s <b>private property,</b> it might have been reasoned that he is liable <b>because at the outset he was acting without permission by chopping wood in the public domain. But</b> if it flew <b>from</b> his <b>private property to the public domain, since he was acting with permission</b> by chopping wood in his private property, one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> liable. Therefore, it is necessary to teach both cases.",
    "<b>And if</b> the mishna <b>had taught</b> only that he is liable in <b>these two</b> cases, it might have been reasoned that in <b>this</b> case, where the damage was caused in the public domain, he is liable <b>because</b> it is <b>common</b> for the <b>multitudes</b> to be there, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where he was chopping in the public domain, he is liable <b>because</b> he was acting <b>without permission. But</b> in the last case, where the chip flew <b>from</b> his <b>private property</b> to <b>another’s private property,</b> where neither of the above reasons applies, <b>as</b> it is <b>not common</b> for the <b>multitudes</b> to be in the place where the damage was caused <b>and he</b> was acting <b>with permission at the outset,</b> one might <b>say</b> he is <b>not</b> liable. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach all these cases.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:25): With regard to <b>one who entered the workshop of a carpenter without</b> the latter’s <b>permission, and a chip of wood flew off and hit him in the face and he died,</b> the carpenter is <b>exempt. But if he entered</b> the shop <b>with permission,</b> the carpenter is <b>liable.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it rules that the carpenter is <b>liable? Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> If the other person was injured, he is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity</b> that one who injures another must pay. These are: Cost of the damage, pain, medical costs, and loss of livelihood. <b>But</b> if the one who entered was killed, he is <b>exempt from exile.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains that he is exempt <b>because</b> this case <b>is not similar to</b> the case of <b>a forest,</b> which is the archetypal case stated in the Torah requiring one who kills unintentionally to be exiled, as it is written: “As when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips off the helve, and finds his neighbor, and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5). This is because in the case of the <b>forest,</b> both <b>this one entered his domain and that one entered his domain,</b> as anyone may use the public domain, whereas in <b>this</b> case, the victim <b>entered another’s property.</b> Therefore, the carpenter is not exiled.",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> On the contrary; it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that he is exiled. <b>And if</b> in the case of the <b>forest,</b> where <b>this one entered of his own accord and that one entered of his own accord,</b> neither asking for the other’s permission, nevertheless the victim <b>is considered like one who entered with the other’s consent and</b> therefore the one who kills unintentionally <b>is exiled, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that in <b>this</b> case, <b>where</b> the victim <b>entered another’s</b> workshop <b>with his consent,</b> the carpenter should be exiled?",
    "<b>Rather, Rava said: What</b> is the reason <b>he is exempt from exile? As exile is not sufficient for him, and this is the reason of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina,</b> who exempts him from exile: <b>Because it is</b> an <b>unintentional</b> killing that is <b>approaching intentional</b> manslaughter. The purpose of exile is to atone for one who kills another completely unintentionally; if he was exceedingly negligent, exile is not sufficient to atone for him.",
    "<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to his own explanation from a mishna: If one is sentenced to be flogged in court and the doctors assessed that he would be able to endure only a certain number of lashes, but the one administering the lashes <b>added one lash to his</b> punishment <b>and he died,</b> the agent of the court <b>is exiled on account of him</b> (<i>Makkot</i> 22b). <b>But here,</b> it is clear <b>that it is</b> a case of <b>an unintentional</b> killing that is <b>approaching intentional</b> manslaughter, <b>as it should have entered his mind that people can die by one</b> additional <b>lash. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that the agent of the court <b>is exiled. Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said</b> in response: It is a case <b>where he erred in the counting,</b> which is not considered approaching intentional manslaughter.",
    "<b>Rava slapped</b> Rav Shimi <b>on his sandal,</b> a gesture of disparagement, and <b>said to him: Is that to say</b> that the one administering the lashes is the one who <b>counts</b> them? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the eldest of the judges recites</b> the verses that are read to a person while he receives lashes, <b>and the second</b> judge <b>counts, and the third says</b> to the one administering the lashes: <b>Strike him?</b> Accordingly, it is not the one administering the lashes who erred in counting.",
    "<b>Rather, Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said:</b> It is a case <b>where the judge himself erred</b> in counting, and the one administering the lashes did not notice this error and meted out an extra lash, causing the person to die. It is therefore considered a completely unintentional killing. Consequently, he is exiled.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another mishna: With regard to <b>one who throws a stone into the public domain and kills</b> someone, <b>he is exiled. But here,</b> it is clear <b>that it is</b> a case of <b>an unintentional</b> killing that is <b>approaching intentional</b> manslaughter, <b>as it should have entered his mind that people are commonly</b> found <b>in the public domain. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>he is exiled.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is not a case where one threw a stone into the public domain for no purpose, but rather <b>where he demolishes his wall,</b> which borders on the public domain, and stones fall into the public domain. Therefore, it is not considered to be approaching intentional manslaughter.",
    "The Gemara questions this assertion: Nevertheless, <b>he should have paid attention</b> to see if there was anyone there, and therefore it should be considered an unintentional killing that approaches intentional manslaughter. The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where he demolishes</b> the wall <b>at night.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: Even <b>at night, he should also have paid attention</b> to see if there was anyone there. The Gemara suggests an alternative interpretation: It is a case <b>where he demolishes his wall during the day into a garbage dump,</b> where people are not commonly found.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this garbage dump? If</b> it is a garbage dump <b>where the multitudes are commonly</b> found, <b>it is</b> considered <b>intentional</b> manslaughter. <b>And if the multitudes are not commonly</b> found there, he should be considered not only one who kills unintentionally, but <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> since he could not have anticipated that someone would be there. Therefore, he should be exempt from exile.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary only in</b> the case of <b>a garbage dump where</b> people are <b>given to relieve themselves at night and are not given to relieve themselves during the day,</b> as it is near the public domain. <b>But there are those who chance by and sit</b> there for this purpose even during the day. On the one hand, <b>he is not</b> one who kills <b>intentionally, as</b> people <b>are not given to relieve themselves</b> there <b>during the day.</b> On the other hand, <b>he is not a victim of circumstances beyond his control either, as there are those who chance by and sit there.</b> Therefore, he is considered one who kills unintentionally and is liable to be exiled.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa taught in the name of Rava</b> that <b>this</b> aforementioned statement of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina is in reference not to the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> but is <b>in reference to the first clause:</b> With regard to <b>one who enters the workshop of a carpenter without permission, and a chip</b> of wood <b>flies off and strikes him in the face and he dies,</b> the carpenter is <b>exempt.</b> In reference to this clause <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> If the one who entered was merely injured, the carpenter is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity. But</b> if the one who entered was killed, he is <b>exempt from exile.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: With regard to <b>the one who teaches this</b> statement <b>in reference to the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, where one enters with permission, <b>all the more so</b> would he teach it <b>in reference to the first clause,</b> where one enters without permission. <b>But the one who teaches this</b> statement <b>in reference to the first clause</b> teaches it only in reference to that clause. <b>But in the</b> case of the <b>last clause, since</b> he entered <b>with permission</b> the carpenter is <b>liable</b> to go into <b>exile.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But is he liable</b> to go into <b>exile</b> when the victim had permission to enter? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>one who enters the workshop of a welder, and sparks [<i>nitzotzot</i>] fly off and strike him in his face and he dies,</b> the welder is <b>exempt, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if</b> the victim <b>entered with permission?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? We are dealing <b>with the welder’s apprentice</b> who enters his workshop. The Gemara asks: <b>Does the welder’s apprentice stand to be killed,</b> i.e., is it permitted to kill him? The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where his mentor is urging him to leave, and he does not leave.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And because his mentor is urging him to leave, does he stand to be killed?</b> The welder should be careful until his apprentice leaves. The Gemara answers: The welder <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> had already <b>left</b> when the accident happened. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why establish that the <i>baraita</i> refers specifically to an apprentice? The welder would be exempt if it were any <b>other</b> person <b>also.</b>"
