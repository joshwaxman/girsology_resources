    "The Gemara asks: <b>But let Rabbi Akiva say to himself</b> the same objection that he raised against Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation of the verse, that the owner of an innocuous ox is exempt from paying half a ransom (see 41b): Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this? <b>But isn’t</b> compensation for damage caused by an innocuous ox <b>itself paid only from</b> the value of <b>its body?</b> Therefore, its owner can say to the slave’s owner: <b>Bring it to court and you will be paid from it.</b> Since the ox was stoned, there is nothing from which he can collect payment.",
    "<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation is applicable in a case <b>where its owner slaughtered it first,</b> before it was sentenced to stoning. <b>Lest you say</b> that the slave’s owner <b>should be paid from</b> the value of the flesh, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that <b>since</b> the ox <b>was subject to be killed, although</b> its owner <b>slaughtered it,</b> the slave’s owner <b>should not be paid from it.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did Rabbi Akiva raise this objection against Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation? <b>According to Rabbi Eliezer as well,</b> it could be explained as referring to a case <b>where</b> its owner <b>slaughtered it first.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Indeed,</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation could also be explained in this manner. <b>And</b> the reason Rabbi Akiva raised this objection was because <b>he reasons: Perhaps</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>has another explanation that is better than this one, and will state it.</b> Rabbi Eliezer did in fact respond with another explanation.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But let Rabbi Eliezer also answer him that</b> the owner <b>slaughtered it first.</b> Why did he offer a different explanation? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Eliezer could have <b>said to you: Specifically there,</b> in the case Rabbi Eliezer referred to in his explanation, namely, <b>where</b> the ox <b>intended to kill</b> another <b>animal but killed a person</b> instead, <b>since the ox was not subject to be killed at all,</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>he should be liable</b> to pay half a ransom from the ox’s body. Therefore, <b>the verse is necessary to exclude</b> the owner from liability to pay half a ransom. <b>But here, since</b> the ox <b>was initially subject to be killed, a verse is not necessary</b> to teach that the owner is exempt from paying half a ransom <b>even if he slaughtered it.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according <b>to Rabbi Akiva also, certainly it is so,</b> that a verse is not necessary to teach that if the owner slaughters the ox before its verdict he is exempt from liability.",
    "<b>Rather, Rav Asi said:</b> The above explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation should be rejected, as <b>I heard this</b> following <b>statement from a great man, and who is he?</b> He is <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b> This is what he said: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rabbi Akiva says</b> in the mishna (33a) that in a case where a person and an innocuous ox damaged each other concurrently, the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>that injured a person also pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference</b> between the two valuations of the damage, as there is no distinction between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox with regard to injuries caused to a person, <b>compensation for the slave is also paid from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, not from the body of the ox; just as in a case where a forewarned ox kills a slave. Therefore, its owner cannot say: Bring it to court and you will be paid from it. To counter this possibility, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that he is exempt from this liability.",
    "<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi: But didn’t Rabbi Akiva</b> already <b>break</b> the force of <b>his fist,</b> i.e., qualify this opinion of his? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the owner of an innocuous ox that injured a person <b>pays</b> compensation <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, the same as the owner of a forewarned ox. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “According to this judgment shall be done to him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:31), indicating that <b>he pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of the ox <b>but he does not pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, as the word <i>lo</i> also means: To it. This negates Rav Asi’s explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation.",
    "<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s statement: The verse is <b>necessary</b> because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since I,</b> referring to the Torah, <b>am more stringent with regard to</b> a forewarned ox that kills a person in the case of a Canaanite <b>slave than</b> in the case of <b>a freeman; as</b> in the case of <b>a freeman</b> who was <b>worth</b> one <b><i>sela</i></b> the owner of the ox <b>gives</b> one <b><i>sela</i></b> in ransom, and if he was worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>he gives thirty; but</b> in the case of a Canaanite <b>slave</b> the Torah imposes a fixed amount, so even if he was <b>worth</b> only one <b><i>sela</i></b> the owner <b>gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, therefore, since the Torah is more stringent in the case of a slave, <b>payment for the slave should also be paid from</b> the owner’s <b>superior-quality</b> property. To counter this, <b>the Merciful One writes: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that payment is not required in a case where an innocuous ox kills a slave.",
    "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rava</b> to Rabbi Akiva’s statement. The <i>baraita</i> states that with regard to the verse <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He shall be <b>clear from payment for</b> a Canaanite <b>slave.</b>",
    "Rabbi Akiva discusses this interpretation: <b>And</b> could this <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference,</b> without the verse? <b>Since</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for</b> the killing of <b>a slave and deemed</b> him <b>liable for</b> the killing of <b>a freeman</b> as well, <b>just as when</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable for a freeman you distinguished between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, as no ransom is paid in the case of an innocuous ox, <b>so too, when</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable for a slave, let us distinguish between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox.",
    "<b>Furthermore,</b> this <i>halakha</i> could be proven through an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If,</b> in the case of <b>a freeman, where he,</b> the owner, <b>gives his full value, you distinguished between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, with regard to <b>a slave, where he gives only thirty</b> <i>sela</i> and not more, even if the slave was worth more, <b>is it not logical that we should distinguish between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, and exempt him from liability for an innocuous ox?",
    "Rabbi Akiva rejects this opinion: <b>No,</b> one could disagree and say the opposite: <b>I,</b> referring to the Torah, <b>am more stringent with regard to</b> the case of <b>a slave than</b> with regard to that of <b>a freeman; as</b> for <b>a freeman worth</b> one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> the ox’s owner <b>gives</b> only one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> and if he is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>he gives thirty. But</b> in the case of <b>a slave,</b> even if he was <b>worth</b> only one <b><i>sela</i>, he gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>. Therefore, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should be liable</b> to pay for a slave killed by his innocuous ox. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that he shall be <b>clear from</b> paying <b>compensation for a slave.</b>",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a forewarned ox: “But if the ox was a goring ox in time past and warning has been given to its owner, and he has not secured it; <b>and it killed a man or a woman;</b> the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). <b>Rabbi Akiva said: And what does this come to teach us? If</b> it is <b>to deem</b> the owner <b>liable for</b> the killing of <b>a woman</b> just <b>as</b> for the killing of <b>a man, this is already stated</b> with regard to an innocuous ox, where it is stated: <b>“When an ox gores a man or a woman,</b> and they die, the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:28).",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the verse is stated <b>to compare a woman to a man</b> with regard to another issue: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a man,</b> payment for <b>his injuries</b> is paid <b>to his heirs, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a woman,</b> payment for <b>her injuries</b> is paid <b>to her heirs,</b> and not to her husband.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Akiva hold</b> that <b>a husband does not inherit</b> from his wife? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall inherit it [<i>otah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 27:11). <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that the husband inherits</b> from <b>his wife,</b> as <i>otah</i> also means: Her. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>",
    "<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>says</b> that her heirs and not her husband receive the payment <b>only with regard to ransom, since it is paid only posthumously and is</b> therefore <b>considered</b> property <b>due</b> to her; <b>and the husband does not take</b> in inheritance the property <b>due</b> to the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed.</b> For instance, an inheritance that would have gone to the woman had she been alive is not awarded to the husband, but rather, to her other heirs.",
    "<b>What is the reason</b> for the assumption that even if it is clear that the victim is about to die, the husband is not owed ransom? <b>The verse states: “And it killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. If a ransom is laid on him,</b> then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid on him” (Exodus 21:29–30), indicating that the owner’s liability to pay ransom is dependent on the ox’s liability to be stoned, which, in turn, applies only after the death of the victim.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to damages, did Rabbi Akiva not say</b> that damages due to a wife are paid to her heirs and not to her husband, just as with regard to ransom?",
    "<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If an assailant <b>struck the woman and her offspring emerged</b> due to miscarriage, <b>he gives</b> compensation for <b>damage and pain to the woman and compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring to the husband.</b> If <b>the husband is not</b> alive, <b>he gives</b> the compensation for the offspring <b>to his heirs.</b> If <b>the woman is not</b> alive, <b>he gives</b> the payment owed to her <b>to her heirs.</b> If <b>she was</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant and</b> then <b>she was emancipated,</b>"
