    "<b>What is the reasoning of Rav Ḥisda,</b> who holds that the requirement to return the animal with the owner’s knowledge is in the case where the owners did not know about the theft? <b>Since</b> the thief <b>taught</b> the lamb to take <b>steps outside,</b> i.e., to leave the owners’ property, it will now require greater supervision, which the owners can provide only if they are aware of the situation.",
    "The Gemara assumes that since Rava explained Rav Ḥisda’s reasoning, he accepts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. The Gemara asks: <b>But did Rava</b> actually <b>say this? Doesn’t Rava say</b> that in the case of <b>this person who saw another lift a lamb from his flock</b> in order to steal it, <b>and</b> the owner then <b>raised</b> his <b>voice at</b> the thief, <b>and</b> the thief <b>discarded it, but</b> the owner <b>did not know if</b> the thief <b>returned</b> the lamb or <b>if he did not return it, and</b> the lamb then <b>died or was stolen,</b> the thief is to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it?</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>What,</b> is this statement of Rava <b>not</b> applicable <b>even if</b> the owner <b>counted</b> his flock after this incident? Accordingly, Rava rules that if the owner knew about the theft, the thief is rendered exempt from liability only if he returns the lamb with the owner’s knowledge, which is not in accordance with the ruling of Rav Ḥisda. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Rava’s ruling applies only <b>where</b> the owner <b>did not count</b> the flock.",
    "The Gemara examines Rav’s ruling. <b>But did Rav</b> actually <b>say this? Doesn’t Rav say</b> that if the thief <b>returned</b> the lamb <b>to the</b> owner’s <b>flock that is in an unsettled area,</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation to return it? This indicates that the thief is exempt from further liability even though the thief did not inform the owner of the lamb’s return and the owner did not count the flock. The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Abba said: Rav concedes</b> that the thief is exempt in this case only <b>where</b> the lamb was <b>spotted [<i>birkuata</i>].</b> Since the lamb’s spots are distinctive, the owner immediately becomes aware of its return.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the amoraic dispute cited previously is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who steals a lamb from a flock or a <i>sela</i> from a purse</b> must <b>return</b> it <b>to the place</b> from where <b>he stole</b> it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The thief is <b>required</b> to return it with the <b>knowledge of</b> its <b>owners.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: The Sages discussing the matter <b>assumed that everyone accepts</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A person is prone to feel his purse constantly,</b> and therefore becomes aware of the theft soon after it takes place. <b>What, is it not</b> a case <b>where a <i>sela</i></b> was stolen with the owner’s <b>knowledge, and</b> the dispute of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva is parallel <b>to the dispute of Rav and Shmuel?</b> According to this explanation, Rav rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, and Shmuel rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> they disagree <b>in</b> the case of <b>a lamb that</b> was stolen <b>without the knowledge</b> of its owners, i.e., they did not know that it was stolen, <b>and</b> the dispute of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva is parallel <b>to the dispute of Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Rav Ḥisda rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva that the lamb must be returned with the owner’s knowledge, and Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael that the owners do not need to become aware of the lamb’s return.",
    "<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: With regard to a bailee who stole</b> a lamb <b>from the owner’s domain, everyone,</b> including Rabbi Yishmael, <b>agrees</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> and the owner must be aware of the animal’s return in order for the thief to become exempt from further liability. <b>And here it is with regard to</b> whether <b>a bailee who stole from</b> within <b>his</b> own <b>domain may return</b> what he stole <b>to the place from</b> where <b>he stole</b> it that <b>they disagree. Rabbi Akiva holds: His safeguarding was terminated</b> when he stole the lamb and he must therefore return it with the owner’s knowledge. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael holds: His safeguarding was not terminated</b> and he may return it to his own domain.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Let</b> us <b>say</b> that with regard to the dispute over whether the owner’s <b>counting</b> of his flock <b>exempts</b> a thief who returned a stolen lamb without notifying the owner, it <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who robbed another and</b> then <b>included</b> the money he owed <b>him</b> for the robbery <b>in the calculation</b> of the payment for a different transaction, i.e., he compensated the owner by overpaying him for a different transaction, <b>it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation to pay, <b>and it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He</b> has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation to pay.",
    "The Sages discussing the matter <b>assumed that everyone accepts</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A person is prone to feel his purse constantly,</b> and therefore becomes aware that he has been compensated soon after the payment is made. <b>What, is it not with regard to this</b> following point that <b>they disagree: The one who says</b> that the robber has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation <b>holds</b> that the <b>counting</b> of the property <b>exempts</b> a robber from further liability, <b>and the one who says</b> that the robber has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation <b>holds</b> that the <b>counting does not exempt</b> a robber from further liability.",
    "The Gemara responds: One can <b>say</b> that <b>if we held in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak,</b> it would follow that <b>everyone agrees that</b> the <b>counting</b> of the property <b>exempts</b> a robber from further liability. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> itself that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage accepts</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, and</b> one <b>Sage does not accept</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak.</b>",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>everyone accepts</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, and</b> it <b>is not difficult: This</b> first <i>baraita</i>, which rules that the robber fulfilled his obligation, is discussing a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>counted</b> the money <b>and placed it</b> directly <b>in</b> the owner’s <b>purse,</b> which the owner will soon open and count. <b>And that</b> other <i>baraita</i>, which rules that the robber did not fulfill his obligation, is discussing a case <b>where he counted</b> the money <b>and placed it in</b> the owner’s <b>hand.</b> Consequently, it is possible that the owner will put the money directly into a container with other coins in it and will never realize that he was compensated for the theft.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are discussing a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>counted</b> the money <b>and placed it in</b> the owner’s <b>purse. This</b> <i>baraita</i> discusses a case <b>where he has other dinars in his purse,</b> but he did not know how many. Therefore, when he counts the money, he will not realize that the robber inserted an additional sum. Whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where he does not have other dinars in his purse,</b> so that when he counts the money he will realize that an additional sum has been included in the payment.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not purchase wool, milk, and kids from the shepherds</b> who tend the flocks of others, due to the concern that they have stolen these items from the owners of the flocks. <b>And</b> similarly, one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>wood and produce from produce watchmen.</b>",
    "<b>But one may purchase from women woolen goods in Judea, and linen goods in the Galilee, and calves in the Sharon,</b> as women in these locations often work with those commodities and it can be assumed that they are selling the items with the owner’s consent. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> items, in a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>told</b> the buyer <b>to conceal</b> the purchase, <b>it is prohibited,</b> as there is good reason to suspect that the items are stolen. <b>And one may purchase eggs and chickens from everywhere,</b> as it is unlikely that one would steal and sell these commodities.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:9): <b>One may purchase from shepherds neither goats, nor kids, nor fleeces, nor torn</b> pieces <b>of wool, but one may purchase sewn</b> garments <b>from them, because they are</b> presumed to be <b>theirs. And one may purchase milk and cheese from them in an unsettled area, but not in a settled area.</b>",
    "<b>And one may purchase from them four or five sheep</b> or <b>four or five fleeces</b> at a time, because it is unlikely that a shepherd would risk stealing such a significant quantity at once. <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two sheep, and</b> similarly, one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two fleeces</b> at a time, as it is reasonable to assume that the shepherd would attempt to steal this amount from the owner.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated</b> animals <b>from them,</b> as it is unlikely that the shepherds would steal them from their owner, who would notice if they did not return home. Conversely, <b>one may not purchase desert,</b> i.e., non-domesticated, animals <b>from them,</b> as it is more likely that a shepherd would steal these animals. <b>The principle of the matter</b> is that with regard to <b>anything that the shepherd sells and the owner</b> would <b>perceive its</b> absence if it were stolen, <b>one may purchase</b> it <b>from them.</b> But if the owner <b>would not perceive its</b> absence, one <b>may not purchase</b> it <b>from them.</b>",
    "The Gemara examines the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> that <b>one may purchase from them four or five sheep</b> or <b>four or five fleeces</b> at a time. <b>Now</b> that <b>it can be said</b> that <b>we</b> may <b>buy four</b> sheep, as it is unlikely that the shepherd would steal such a large quantity at one time, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that we may buy <b>five?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The meaning of the <i>baraita</i> is that one may purchase <b>four</b> sheep <b>out of</b> a flock consisting of <b>five</b> sheep, as it is reasonable to assume that the shepherd would not attempt to steal four-fifths of the owner’s flock. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> as follows: <b>Four</b> sheep may be purchased <b>from</b> the shepherd of <b>a small flock, and five</b> may be purchased <b>from</b> the shepherd of <b>a large flock.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks another question with regard to the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This matter itself is difficult,</b> as <b>you said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: One may purchase <b>from them four or five sheep</b> or <b>four or five fleeces</b> at a time, which indicates that purchasing <b>four or five, yes,</b> it is permitted, <b>but</b> purchasing <b>three, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>Say the latter clause: But</b> one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two sheep.</b> This indicates <b>that we may purchase three</b> sheep at a time.",
    "The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> clause, which permits the purchase of three sheep, is discussing a case <b>where</b> the sheep are <b>robust,</b> and therefore the owner is more attentive to them and would notice if three were missing. Conversely, <b>that</b> clause, which prohibits the purchase of three sheep, is discussing a case <b>where</b> the sheep are <b>frail.</b> Consequently, the owner does not care about them as much, and it is possible that he would not notice if only three of them went missing.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated</b> animals <b>from them,</b> but <b>one may not purchase desert</b> animals <b>from them. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda referring to the first clause, and</b> his statement is therefore <b>a stringency? Or perhaps</b> it <b>is referring to the latter clause, and</b> his statement is <b>a leniency?</b>",
    "The Gemara elaborates: Is it <b>referring to the first clause, and</b> his statement is therefore <b>a stringency, as he</b> would be <b>saying: One may purchase four or five sheep from them,</b> and <b>this statement applies</b> only to <b>domesticated</b> animals, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>desert</b> animals, <b>even four or five sheep</b> may <b>not</b> be purchased? <b>Or perhaps</b> it <b>is referring to the latter clause and</b> it is <b>a leniency, as he</b> would be <b>saying: But</b> one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two sheep, and</b> similarly, one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two fleeces,</b> and <b>this statement applies</b> only to <b>desert</b> animals, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>domesticated</b> animals, <b>one may purchase even two</b> animals.",
    "The Gemara presents an answer: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated</b> animals <b>from them, but one may not purchase desert</b> animals <b>from them. But one may always purchase four or five sheep from them.</b>"
