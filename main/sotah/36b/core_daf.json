    "The names of the tribes were <b>not divided on the stones of the ephod the</b> same <b>way that they were divided in</b> the list found at the beginning of <b>the book of Numbers</b> (Numbers 1:1–15). <b>Rather</b> they were divided <b>the way that they were divided in the second book,</b> i.e., Exodus (Exodus 1:2–4).",
    "<b>How</b> were they written? On one stone, the names of <b>the sons of Leah</b> were written <b>in the order of their</b> birth: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. On the other stone <b>the sons of Rachel</b> were written. <b>One,</b> Benjamin, was written <b>on this side,</b> i.e., at the bottom of the list, <b>and one,</b> Joseph, was written <b>on that side,</b> i.e., at the top of the list. <b>And the children of the handmaids,</b> i.e., Bilhah and Zilpah, who were Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher, were written on the second stone <b>in the middle.</b>",
    "<b>But rather,</b> if their names were not written in the order of their births, then <b>how do I establish</b> the meaning of the phrase: <b>“According to their birth”</b> (Exodus 28:10)? It means that their names were written <b>according to</b> the <b>names that their father,</b> Jacob, <b>called them, and not according to the names that Moses called them.</b> On the stones it said <b>Reuben, and not Reubenites; Simeon, and not Simeonites; Dan, and not Danites; Gad, and not Gadites.</b> This <i>baraita</i> contradicts Rav Kahana’s opinion, as according to all of the opinions in the <i>baraita</i>, the division of the names on the ephod is not identical to the division of the tribes on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. The Gemara confirms: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Kahana is</b> in fact <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>“And the half of them</b> facing Mount Ebal” (Joshua 8:33)? It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The use of the definitive article in the verse indicates that the smaller half of the Jewish people was on Mount Ebal. <b>The half that was facing Mount Gerizim was larger than the half on Mount Ebal, because</b> the tribe of <b>Levi</b> was included in the group that was facing Mount Gerizim, and they remained <b>on the bottom</b> between the two mountains.",
    "The Gemara is puzzled by this statement: <b>On the contrary, because</b> the tribe of <b>Levi</b> remained <b>on the bottom they were fewer</b> in number. The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Although</b> the tribe of <b>Levi was on the bottom, the descendants of Joseph were among them,</b> and the tribe of Joseph was numerous, <b>as it is stated: “And the children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying: Why did you give me a single lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people,</b> forasmuch as the Lord has blessed me thus, <b>and Joshua said to them: If you are a great people, you should go up to the forest”</b> (Joshua 17:14–15).",
    "The Gemara explains that Joshua <b>said to them: Go and hide yourselves in the forests, so that the evil eye will not have dominion over you,</b> as you are such a large number of people. The tribe of Joseph <b>said to him: The evil eye does not have dominion over the offspring of Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain”</b> (Genesis 49:22), <b>and Rabbi Abbahu says: Do not read</b> the verse as saying: <b>“By a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Those who rise above</b> the evil <b>eye [<i>olei ayin</i>],</b> teaching that Joseph and his descendants are not susceptible to the evil eye.",
    "The Gemara cites an alternative source for the assertion that the evil eye holds no sway over Joseph and his descendants: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that it is derived <b>from here:</b> Jacob blessed Joseph’s children and said: <b>“And let them grow [<i>veyidgu</i>] into a multitude in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>fish [<i>dagim</i>] in the sea, waters cover them and the</b> evil <b>eye</b> therefore <b>has no dominion over them, so too,</b> with regard to <b>Joseph’s descendants, the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks with regard to the <i>baraita</i> that contradicts Rav Kahana’s opinion: <b>Are these</b> names of the tribes, which were written on the ephod, composed of a total of <b>fifty letters?</b> There <b>are</b> only <b>forty-nine. Rabbi Yitzḥak says: They added one letter to</b> the name of <b>Joseph [<i>Yosef</i>]</b> when it was written on the ephod, <b>as it is stated: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>Yehosef</i>] for a testimony when He went forth against the land of Egypt”</b> (Psalms 81:6).",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak objects to this: We require</b> the names to be written <b>“according to their birth,”</b> and Joseph was not called <i>Yehosef</i> from birth. <b>Rather,</b> the explanation is as follows: Throughout <b>the entire Torah,</b> the name of <b>Benjamin is written</b> without a second letter <i>yod</i> between the letters <i>mem</i> and <i>nun</i>, <b>and here,</b> where he is born, <b>Benjamin</b> is written <b>in full,</b> spelled with a second <i>yod</i>. <b>As it is written: “But his father called him Benjamin”</b> (Genesis 35:18). Therefore, his name was written on the ephod with a second <i>yod</i>, “according to his birth.”",
    "§ <b>Rav Ḥana bar Bizna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says: Joseph, who sanctified the name of Heaven in private, had one letter of the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> the letter <i>heh</i>, <b>added to his</b> name. Whereas in the case of <b>Judah, who sanctified the name of Heaven in public [<i>befarhesya</i>]</b> at the Red Sea during the exodus from Egypt, merited that <b>his entire</b> name <b>is called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> as the entire four-letter name of God can be found within Judah’s name.",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the situation where <b>Joseph</b> sanctified God’s name in private? <b>As it is written: “And it came to pass on a certain day, when he went into the house to do his work”</b> (Genesis 39:11). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This <b>teaches that both</b> Joseph and Potiphar’s wife stayed in the house, as they <b>intended to</b> perform <b>a matter of sin.</b> With regard to the phrase <b>“when he went into the house to do his work,” Rav and Shmuel</b> engage in a dispute with regard to its meaning. <b>One says:</b> It means that he went into the house <b>to do his work, literally. And one says: He entered</b> the house <b>in order to fulfill his</b> sexual <b>needs</b> with her.",
    "The verse continues: <b>“And there was none of the men of the house</b> there within” (Genesis 39:11). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it possible</b> that in such <b>a large</b> and important <b>house like the house of that wicked man</b> that <b>no one was in there? The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: That day was their festival day and they all went to their house of idol worship; and she told them</b> that <b>she was sick</b> and could not go, as <b>she said</b> to herself: <b>I have no day on which Joseph will attend to me like this day.</b>",
    "The verse states: <b>“And she caught him by his garment, saying:</b> Lie with me” (Genesis 39:12). <b>At that moment his father’s image [<i>deyokeno</i>] came and appeared to him in the window.</b> The image <b>said to him: Joseph,</b> the names of <b>your brothers are destined to be written on the stones of the ephod, and you</b> are to be included <b>among them. Do you desire your name to be erased from among them, and to be called an associate [<i>ro’eh</i>] of promiscuous women? As it is written: “But he who keeps company with harlots wastes his riches”</b> (Proverbs 29:3), as he loses his honor, which is more valuable than wealth.",
    "<b>Immediately: “And his bow abode [<i>teishev</i>] firm”</b> (Genesis 49:24). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> This means <b>that his bow,</b> i.e., his penis, <b>returned [<i>shava</i>] to its strength,</b> as he overcame his desire. The verse about Joseph continues: <b>“And the arms of his hands were made supple”</b> (Genesis 49:24), meaning that <b>he dug his hands into the ground and his semen was emitted between his fingernails.</b>",
    "<b>“By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob”</b> (Genesis 49:24): <b>Who caused his</b> name <b>to be etched onto the stones of the ephod?</b> It was <b>only the might of Jacob. “From there, from the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel”</b> (Genesis 49:24) means: <b>From there,</b> because of Joseph’s ability to withstand this trial, <b>he merited to become a shepherd [<i>ro’eh</i>]</b> of the Jewish people, <b>as it is stated: “Listen, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads like the flock of Joseph”</b> (Psalms 80:2).",
    "<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Joseph was deserving of having twelve tribes descend from him,</b> the same <b>as</b> twelve tribes <b>descended from his father Jacob, as it is stated: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph”</b> (Genesis 37:2). This implies that everything that happened to Jacob was destined to happen to Joseph. <b>However,</b> he did not merit this because <b>his semen was emitted from between his fingernails. And even so,</b> the offspring that were meant to descend from him <b>descended from his brother Benjamin,</b> who had ten sons. <b>And they were all named after</b> Joseph, <b>as it is stated: “And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel,</b> Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard” (Genesis 46:21).",
    "The Gemara explains how each name relates to Joseph: <b>Bela</b> was named after Joseph, <b>who was swallowed [<i>nivla</i>] among the nations. And Becher</b> received that name because Joseph <b>was the firstborn [<i>bekhor</i>] of his mother,</b> Rachel. <b>And Ashbel</b> received his name <b>because God sent</b> Joseph <b>into captivity [<i>shevao El</i>]</b> in Egypt. <b>Gera</b> was named after Joseph, <b>who dwelled [<i>gar</i>] in a foreign land [<i>akhsaneyut</i>].</b>",
    "<b>And Naaman</b> was called that <b>because</b> Joseph <b>was extremely pleasing [<i>na’im</i>]. Ehi and Rosh</b> received these names, as Benjamin said: Joseph <b>is my brother [<i>aḥi</i>] and my leader [<i>roshi</i>].</b> Benjamin named his sons <b>Muppim and Huppim,</b> as Benjamin said: Joseph <b>did not see my wedding canopy [<i>ḥuppa</i>] and I did not see his wedding canopy. And Ard</b> was named after Joseph, <b>who descended [<i>yarad</i>] to</b> the lands of <b>the nations of the world. Some say</b> that the name <b>Ard</b> means <b>that</b> Joseph’s <b>face was similar</b> in its beauty <b>to a rose [<i>vered</i>].</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: When Pharaoh said to Joseph: “And without you no man shall lift up his hand</b> or his foot in all the land of Egypt” (Genesis 41:44), <b>Pharaoh’s astrologers said: You will appoint a slave whose master bought him for twenty silver</b> coins <b>to rule over us? He said to them: I perceive royal characteristics [<i>ginnunei malkhut</i>] in him</b> and see that he was not initially a slave.",
    "<b>They said to him: If</b> that is <b>so</b> and he is a child of royalty, <b>he should know</b> the <b>seventy languages</b> that all kings’ children learn. The angel <b>Gabriel</b> then <b>came and taught him</b> the <b>seventy languages,</b> but <b>he could not learn</b> all of them. Gabriel then <b>added one letter,</b> the letter <i>heh</i>, to Joseph’s name <b>from the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and</b> then <b>he</b> was able to <b>learn</b> the languages, <b>as it is stated: “He appointed it in Joseph [<i>Yehosef</i>] for a testimony, when he went forth against the land of Egypt, the speech of one that I did not know I heard”</b> (Psalms 81:6). <b>And the next day,</b> when he appeared before Pharaoh, in <b>every language that Pharaoh spoke with him, he answered him.</b>",
    "Joseph then <b>spoke in the sacred tongue,</b> Hebrew, and Pharaoh <b>did not know what he was saying.</b> Pharaoh <b>said to him: Teach me</b> that language. <b>He taught him, but he</b> could <b>not learn</b> it. Pharaoh <b>said to him: Take an oath for my</b> benefit <b>that you will not reveal</b> that I do not know this language. <b>He took an oath for his</b> benefit.",
    "Years later, <b>when</b> Joseph <b>said to</b> Pharaoh: <b>“My father made me swear, saying”</b> (Genesis 50:5) that I would bury him in Eretz Yisrael, Pharaoh <b>said to him: Go request</b> the dissolution <b>of your oath.</b> Joseph <b>said to him: And should I also request</b> dissolution <b>for</b> the oath that I took <b>for your</b> benefit? <b>And</b> consequently, <b>even though</b> Pharaoh <b>was not amenable</b> to letting Joseph go, he worried that Joseph would then request dissolution for the oath that he had taken for his benefit, and Pharaoh therefore <b>said to him: “Go up and bury your father according to what he made you swear”</b> (Genesis 50:6).",
    "§ <b>What</b> was the incident where <b>Judah</b> sanctified God’s name in public? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: When the Jewish people stood at the</b> Red <b>Sea, the tribes were arguing with one other. This one was saying: I am going into the sea first, and that one was saying: I am going into the sea first.</b> Then, in <b>jumped</b>"
