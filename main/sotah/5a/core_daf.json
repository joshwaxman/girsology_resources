    "<b>Even</b> if the one who committed adultery <b>performs charitable</b> deeds <b>secretly,</b> as alluded to in the phrase “hand to hand,” and even if one might think that one who does so will go unpunished, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to charity of this kind: <b>“A gift in secret pacifies wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:14), nevertheless, <b>he will not be unpunished from the judgment of Gehenna.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara previously discussed the impropriety of the trait of arrogance. Now the Gemara discusses the source of its prohibition. <b>From where is the warning</b> derived, i.e., what is the source prohibiting the behavior <b>of the arrogant? Rava says</b> that <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> The source is from the verse: <b>“Hear, you, and give ear, be not proud,</b> for the Lord has spoken” (Jeremiah 13:15). <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> the warning is <b>from here: “Then your heart be lifted up, and you forget</b> the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:14), <b>and it is</b> also <b>written</b> in that same passage: <b>“Beware lest you forget the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 8:11).",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> these sources are <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>that Rabbi Avin</b> says that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says, as Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: Wherever it is stated</b> in a verse <b>“beware,” “lest,” or “not,”</b> this is <b>nothing other</b> than <b>a prohibition.</b> Since these verses employ these terms in the context of one who is arrogant, they serve as sources for the prohibition.",
    "<b>Rav Avira interpreted</b> the following verse <b>homiletically:</b> “They are exalted for a little while, and they are gone; yes, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all others, and wither as the tops of the husks” (Job 24:24). There were <b>times</b> when <b>he said this</b> interpretation <b>in the name of Rav Asi and</b> there were <b>times</b> when <b>he said it in the name of Rav Ami: Any person who has arrogance within him will ultimately be diminished</b> in standing, <b>as it is stated</b> in the phrase: <b>“They are exalted for a little while,”</b> indicating that one who raises himself above others will be exalted only briefly. <b>And lest you say that</b> even if he is diminished <b>he</b> will still <b>exist in this world</b> and live a full life, <b>the verse states: “And they are gone,”</b> indicating that they die before their time.",
    "He continues the interpretation: <b>But if he repents from</b> his arrogance, <b>he is gathered</b> in death <b>at his proper time like Abraham our forefather, as it is stated: “Yes, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all [<i>kakkol</i>] others”</b> (Job 24:24), indicating that when he repents from his arrogance he will die <b>like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written about them</b> that they were blessed with the term “all,” as in the verse above. With regard to Abraham, the verse states: “And the Lord had blessed Abraham <b>in all</b> things <b>[<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1). With regard to Isaac, the verse states: “And I have eaten <b>of all [<i>mikkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 27:33). With regard to Jacob, the verse states: “And because I have <b>all [<i>khol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 33:11). <b>And if</b> one does <b>not</b> repent, then, the verse in Job continues: <b>“And wither like the tops of the husks.”</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“and</b> wither <b>like the tops of the husks”? Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda</b> offered differing interpretations. <b>One says</b> that it means: <b>Like the awn</b> of bristle-like growth on the top <b>of the husk, and one says</b> that it means: <b>Like the husk itself.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to the one who says: Like the awn</b> of bristle-like growth on the top <b>of the husk, that is that which is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And</b> wither <b>like the tops of the husks,”</b> since this awn is on the top of the husk. <b>But according to the one who says: Like the husk itself, what</b> is the meaning of the expression <b>“and</b> wither <b>like the tops of the husks”? Rav Asi says, and similarly the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> This can be explained by way of <b>an analogy to a person who enters into his field,</b> as <b>he gathers the taller</b> stalks before the shorter ones. The verse is therefore referring to the tallest stalks, not the tops of the stalks.",
    "The Gemara continues the discussion of arrogance, and its converse, humility. The verse states: “For thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, <b>also with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,</b> to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda</b> offered differing interpretations of this verse. <b>One says</b> that the verse means: Together <b>with Me</b> is the person who is <b>contrite</b> and humble. In other words, God elevates the humble. <b>And one says</b> that the verse means: <b>I,</b> God, descend, and am found together <b>with</b> the person who is <b>contrite</b> and humble.",
    "The Gemara comments on this: <b>And</b> it <b>stands to reason</b> that the meaning of the verse is <b>like the one who says: I</b> am <b>with</b> the <b>contrite</b> person, <b>as the Holy One, Blessed be He, disregarded all</b> of the <b>mountains and hills, and rested His Divine Presence on</b> the lowly <b>Mount Sinai, and</b> He <b>did not</b> choose to <b>raise Mount Sinai up</b> toward Him. God chose to give the Torah on Mount Sinai, as it was a symbol of humility due to its lack of height, and He lowered His Divine Presence, as it were, to the mountain.",
    "<b>Rav Yosef says: A person should always learn</b> proper behavior <b>from the wisdom of his Creator, as the Holy One, Blessed be He, disregarded all</b> of the <b>mountains and hills and rested His Divine Presence on the</b> lowly <b>Mount Sinai. And</b> similarly, when appearing to Moses, <b>He disregarded all</b> of the <b>beautiful trees and rested His Divine Presence on the bush</b> (Exodus 3:2).",
    "<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him,</b> it is <b>fitting to hew him down, as a tree designated for idolatry [<i>asheira</i>]</b> is hewn down, as <b>it is written here</b> with regard to the arrogant: <b>“And the high ones of stature shall be hewn down [<i>gedu’im</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 10:33), <b>and it is written there</b> with regard to trees designated for idolatry: <b>“And hew down [<i>teggade’un</i>] their trees worshipped as part of idolatrous rites [<i>asheireihem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:5).",
    "<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> also <b>says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, his dust,</b> i.e., his remains in his grave, <b>will not stir</b> at the time of the resurrection of the dead, <b>as it is stated: “Awake and sing for joy, you who dwell in the dust”</b> (Isaiah 26:19). <b>It is not stated: You who lie in the dust,</b> which would indicate that all the dead will be awakened in the future, <b>but rather: “You who dwell in the dust,”</b> indicating that only <b>one who became a neighbor to the dust in his lifetime</b> by living with extreme humility will stir at the time of the resurrection.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, the Divine Presence wails over him. As it is stated:</b> “For though the Lord is high, yet regards He the lowly, <b>and from the haughty He is pained from afar”</b> (Psalms 138:6).",
    "<b>Rav Avira interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> interpreted as follows: <b>Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not like the attribute of flesh and blood. The attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that the <b>elevated sees the elevated, but the elevated does not see the lowly. But the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not</b> like <b>that. He is elevated but sees</b> specifically <b>the lowly, as it is stated: “For though the Lord is high, yet regards He the lowly”</b> (Psalms 138:6).",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda says, and some say</b> that <b>Mar Ukva</b> says: Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: He and I cannot dwell</b> together <b>in the world, as it is stated: “He who slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I destroy; he who is haughty of eye and proud of heart, him will I not suffer [<i>oto lo ukhal</i>]”</b> (Psalms 101:5–6). These verses should be understood as follows: <b>Do not read</b> the verse as: <b>“<i>Oto</i></b> <i>lo ukhal</i>”; <b>rather,</b> read it as: <b><i>Itto lo ukhal</i>,</b> meaning, <b>with him, I cannot</b> bear to dwell. <b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> that <b>this</b> was stated <b>with regard to those who speak slander</b> because the beginning of the verse states: <b>“He who slanders his neighbor in secret, him will I destroy.”</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Alexandri says:</b> Concerning <b>any person who has arrogance within him, even a slight wind disturbs him, as it is stated: “But the wicked are like the troubled sea,</b> for it cannot rest” (Isaiah 57:20). <b>And if</b> with regard to the <b>sea,</b> which <b>contains many</b> quantities of <b>quarters</b> of a <i>log</i> of water, yet <b>a slight wind disturbs it,</b> certainly with regard to <b>a person, who has</b> in his body <b>only one quarter-<i>log</i></b> of essential lifeblood, <b>all the more so</b> will a slight wind disturb him.",
    "<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Despite the opprobrium assigned to one who exhibits the trait of arrogance, <b>a Torah scholar must have one-eighth of one-eighth</b> of arrogance. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: And</b> this minute measure of arrogance <b>crowns him as the awn</b> of bristle-like growth on the top <b>of the husk. Rava said:</b> A Torah scholar <b>who has</b> arrogance <b>should be excommunicated, and one who does not have</b> arrogance at all <b>should be excommunicated</b> as well. As such, he must have only a minute measure of arrogance.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Even a Torah scholar <b>should not have any</b> arrogance <b>or any part of</b> arrogance, i.e., not even one-eighth of one-eighth. He explains why arrogance should be avoided entirely by asking: <b>Is it a small</b> matter <b>that it is written with regard to</b> arrogance: <b>“Everyone that is proud of heart is an abomination to the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 16:5)?",
    "<b>Ḥizkiyya says: The prayers of a person are heard only if he casts his heart</b> to be <b>like flesh,</b> by being free of arrogance. <b>As it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that from one New Moon to another,</b> and from one Sabbath to another, <b>shall all flesh come to worship</b> before Me, says the Lord” (Isaiah 66:23).",
    "<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Concerning leprosy of the <b>flesh, it is written</b> in the verse <b>with regard to it:</b> “And when the flesh has in the skin thereof a boil, <b>and it is healed”</b> (Leviticus 13:18), but concerning the leprosy of <b>a person, it is not written</b> in the verse <b>with regard to it: And it is healed.</b> Both verses discussing leprosy of a person make no mention of healing (Leviticus 13:2, 13:9). This indicates that one who sees himself as flesh will be cured, but one who holds himself in high regard will not be cured.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The Hebrew word for person, <i>adam</i>, written: <b><i>Alef</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>mem</i>,</b> is an acronym for <b><i>efer</i>,</b> dust; <b><i>dam</i>,</b> blood; and <b><i>mara</i>,</b> bile, alluding to man’s insignificance. Similarly, the Hebrew word for flesh, <i>basar</i>, written: <b><i>Beit</i>, <i>sin</i>, <i>reish</i>,</b> is an acronym for <b><i>busha</i>,</b> shame; <b><i>seruḥa</i>,</b> putrid; and <b><i>rimma</i>,</b> worm, also alluding to his insignificance. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the letter <i>sin</i> of the word <i>basar</i> actually is referring to a different word, <b><i>sheol</i>, the netherworld, as it is written with</b> the Hebrew letter <b><i>shin</i>.</b> The letter <i>sin</i> is phonetically similar to the letter <i>samekh</i>, the first letter of the word <i>seruḥa</i>, but is orthographically similar to the letter <i>shin</i>, the first letter of the word <i>sheol</i>. The dispute is whether the acronym should be based upon the pronunciation or upon the way it is written.",
    "<b>Rav Ashi says: Any person who has arrogance within him will ultimately be diminished</b> in stature, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to different types of leprosy:"
