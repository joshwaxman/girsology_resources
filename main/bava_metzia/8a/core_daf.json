    "This is because each party receives an item that has monetary value, <b>as it is fit</b> to be made into a garment <b>for small</b> children.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as for that <b>which Rava said,</b> that <b>if</b> the <b>garment was</b> fashioned <b>with gold</b> thread <b>they divide</b> it, does that <b>also</b> mean <b>that they divide</b> the garment itself? By doing so they would <b>ruin it.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult, as</b> after the garment is divided <b>it is fit</b> to be made into a garment <b>for the children of kings</b> or wealthy people. Therefore, it is not ruined.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna (2a): If <b>two</b> people <b>were sitting on an animal</b> and each of them claims to own the entire animal, they each take an oath and divide the animal, does that <b>also</b> mean <b>that they divide</b> the animal itself? By doing so they would <b>ruin it. Granted,</b> if it is <b>a kosher</b> animal it is <b>fit</b> to be slaughtered and divided between them <b>for</b> the <b>meat. But</b> if it is <b>a non-kosher</b> animal, slaughtering it and dividing the carcass would <b>ruin it</b> and render it worthless. <b>Rather,</b> clearly they divide its <b>monetary</b> value. <b>Here too,</b> in the other cases where the ruling is to divide the item, it means that the litigants divide its <b>monetary</b> value and not the item itself.",
    "§ Based on an inference from the mishna on 2a, <b>Rami bar Ḥama says: That is to say:</b> In a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person, i.e., the latter, <b>acquires</b> ownership of the item.",
    "Rami bar Ḥama explains his inference: <b>As, if it enters your mind</b> that if one lifts a found item for another <b>the other does not acquire</b> the item, this garment has not been acquired by either of the two litigants, as each prevents the other’s acquisition. If that were the case, <b>this</b> part of the garment, held by one of them, <b>would be considered as though</b> it is still <b>lying on the ground, and that</b> part of the garment, held by the other one, would be considered <b>as though</b> it is still <b>lying on the ground, and neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one <b>acquires</b> it; if a third party takes it, it is his. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> it that in a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person <b>acquires</b> the item?",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> This is not a proof, as <b>actually I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that in a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item</b> solely <b>on behalf of another, the other</b> person <b>does not acquire</b> the item. <b>And here</b> in the mishna, <b>this is the reason</b> the two litigants acquire the garment: <b>Since</b> each of the litigants <b>acquires</b> part of the garment <b>for himself, he also acquires</b> the other part <b>for the other</b> one.",
    "Rava adds: <b>Know</b> that one who acquires an item for himself can acquire part of it for another, <b>as, if</b> someone <b>says to his agent: Go out and steal</b> an item <b>for me, and</b> the agent <b>stole</b> that item, the one who sent him is <b>exempt</b> from liability, due to the principle that there is no agency for sin; <b>but partners who stole</b> an item together are both <b>liable</b> even if only one of them actually lifted the item. <b>What is the reason</b> that they are both liable? Is it <b>not because we say</b> that <b>since</b> the one <b>who</b> lifted the item <b>acquires</b> part of it <b>for himself, he also acquires</b> the other part <b>for the other</b> one, his partner? The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it</b> that this principle is correct.",
    "<b>Rava said</b> in continuation of his statement: <b>Now that you said</b> that <b>we say: Since [<i>miggo</i>]</b> one acquires part of an item for himself he can also acquire the other part for another, another <i>halakha</i> can be derived: In a case of <b>a deaf-mute and</b> a mentally <b>competent</b> person <b>who lifted a found item</b> simultaneously, <b>since</b> the <b>deaf-mute acquires</b> his part of the item, the mentally <b>competent</b> person also <b>acquires</b> his portion.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the <b>deaf-mute acquires</b> his portion of the found item, <b>as</b> a <b>mentally competent</b> person <b>lifted it for him;</b> since the mentally competent person acquired his own part, he also acquired the other part for the deaf-mute. <b>But how does</b> the <b>mentally competent</b> person <b>acquire</b> his part? He needs the deaf-mute to acquire it for him, and a deaf-mute cannot acquire an item for another.",
    "<b>Rather, say</b> Rava’s statement differently: The <b>deaf-mute acquires</b> his part, but the mentally <b>competent</b> person <b>does not acquire</b> his part. <b>And what</b> is the principle of <b><i>miggo</i></b> from which Rava derives this <i>halakha</i>? It is not the principle that one who acquires a found item for himself can acquire part of it for another as well, but rather: <b>Since [<i>miggo</i>] in general two deaf-mutes</b> who pick up an item simultaneously <b>acquire</b> it, in <b>this</b> case <b>too,</b> the deaf-mute <b>acquires</b> it, even though the mentally competent person does not acquire it.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> derivation? Even <b>if you say</b> that in a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person <b>acquires</b> it, as Rami bar Ḥama says, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>where he lifts it with the intention of</b> having <b>the other person</b> acquire the item. But in <b>this</b> case, the mentally competent person <b>lifted</b> the item <b>with the intention of</b> acquiring it for <b>himself;</b> he had no intention of acquiring it for the deaf-mute. If <b>he does not acquire</b> the item for himself, <b>does he acquire</b> it <b>for others?</b>",
    "<b>Rather, say</b> that <b>since</b> the mentally <b>competent</b> person <b>does not acquire</b> any part of the found item, the <b>deaf-mute does not acquire</b> it either.",
    "<b>And if you would say:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the <b>general</b> case of an item that was found by <b>two deaf-mutes,</b> in which they both acquire it? The answer is that <b>there,</b> in that case, <b>the Sages instituted</b> an ordinance <b>for them</b> that they both acquire the item <b>so that they will not come to quarrel</b> with others who want to take the item from them due to the fact that a deaf-mute lacks the halakhic ability to acquire the item. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the deaf-mute and the mentally competent person, the deaf-mute <b>says</b> to himself: If even the mentally <b>competent</b> person <b>does not acquire</b> the item, <b>can I acquire</b> it? Therefore, in that case, he will not quarrel if others take the item from him.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Adda, said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> in the mishna <b>is Rami bar Ḥama’s inference</b> drawn? <b>If we say</b> that he infers it <b>from the first clause</b> of the mishna, i.e., the case of <b>two</b> people <b>holding a garment,</b> isn’t the case <b>there</b> one in which <b>this</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and I lifted the entire</b> garment; <b>and that</b> one <b>says: All of it is mine, and I lifted the entire</b> garment? How can the <i>halakha</i> where one acquires an item for another be inferred from that case?",
    "<b>Rather,</b> he infers it <b>from that which is taught</b> later in the mishna: <b>This</b> one <b>says all of it is mine and that</b> one <b>says all of it is mine. Why do I</b> need <b>this</b> case <b>as well?</b> The first case, where each one says: I found it, is sufficient. <b>Rather, learn from</b> the <b>superfluous</b> case in the <b>mishna</b> that even if they lifted it simultaneously, they divide it and a third party has no right to take it, as in a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person <b>acquires</b> the item.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> that clause in the mishna is not superfluous; <b>didn’t we</b> already <b>establish</b> (2a) that <b>the first clause</b> is referring <b>to</b> a dispute over <b>a found item, and the latter clause</b> is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>buying and selling,</b> where each party claims that he is the one who bought the item from its seller?",
    "<b>Rather,</b> Rami bar Ḥama infers his ruling <b>from the latter clause</b> of the mishna, i.e., the case where <b>this</b> one <b>says all of it is mine and that</b> one <b>says half of it is mine. Why do I</b> need <b>this</b> case <b>as well?</b> What does it add to the previous cases? <b>Rather, learn from</b> this <b>superfluous</b> case in the <b>mishna</b> that in a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person <b>acquires</b> the item.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it inferred <b>that</b> this clause is referring <b>to</b> the case of <b>a found item? Perhaps</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>buying and selling.</b>",
    "<b>And if you would say: If</b> it were referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>buying and selling, what</b> would be the purpose <b>of stating</b> it, as it adds no novel ruling? One could answer that it <b>was necessary</b> to teach this additional case, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>the one who says: Half of it is mine, should be considered the equivalent of one returning a lost item;</b> he could have claimed that the garment was entirely his, and instead he conceded half of it to the other party <b>and</b> consequently <b>he should be exempt</b> from taking an oath. To counter this, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> he is not exempt, as perhaps <b>this</b> person <b>is employing artifice.</b> Perhaps he is <b>thinking: If I say</b> that <b>all of it is mine I will need to take an oath. I will state this</b> claim, that half of it is mine, <b>as I will</b> thereby <b>be considered the equivalent of one returning a lost item, and I will be exempt</b> from taking an oath. Therefore, this clause is not superfluous; it teaches that this litigant is not considered the equivalent of one returning a lost item.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> Rami bar Ḥama infers his ruling <b>from this</b> clause: If <b>two</b> people <b>were sitting on an animal,</b> and each of them claims that it is his, each of them takes an oath and they divide the value of the animal. <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this</b> case <b>as well?</b> It teaches no novel <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rather, learn from</b> this <b>superfluous</b> clause in the <b>mishna</b> that in a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person <b>acquires</b> the item.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps this</b> mishna <b>teaches us that</b> one <b>who sits</b> on an animal <b>also acquires</b> it, even though he has not caused the animal to move.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> Rami bar Ḥama inferred his ruling <b>from the last clause</b> in the mishna: <b>When they</b> each <b>admit</b> to the validity of the other’s claim <b>or when they have witnesses</b> attesting to their claims, <b>they divide</b> it <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath. To what</b> case is the mishna referring? <b>If</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>buying and selling,</b> does it <b>need to be said? Rather, is it not</b> referring <b>to a found item?</b> Accordingly, the reason they divide the item is that they knowingly lifted it together, and they intended to acquire it for both of them. <b>And learn from it</b> that in a case of <b>one who</b> performs an act of acquisition by <b>lifting a found item on behalf of another, the other</b> person <b>acquires</b> the item.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>And Rava said to you</b> that this clause is based on a different principle: When one acquires an item, <b>since he acquires</b> it <b>for himself he can also acquire</b> part of it <b>for another</b> person.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: If <b>two</b> people <b>were sitting</b> on an animal, or one was sitting on the animal and the other one was leading it, and each claims ownership of the animal, they must each take an oath and they divide it. <b>Rav Yosef said: Rav Yehuda said to me:</b>"
