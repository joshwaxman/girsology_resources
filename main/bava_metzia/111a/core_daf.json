    "<b>And that</b> one, the middleman, is exempt <b>because his work is not</b> performed <b>for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> the middleman <b>said to them: Your wages</b> are incumbent <b>upon me, his wages are</b> indeed <b>upon him,</b> as the one who hired the workers bears full responsibility. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who hires a laborer to perform</b> work <b>in his own</b> field, <b>and</b> the employer inadvertently <b>showed</b> the laborer a field <b>belonging to another</b> in which he should work, the employer <b>must give</b> the laborer <b>his full wages; and</b> in addition, the employer <b>goes back and takes from the owner</b> of the field in which he worked the value of <b>the benefit</b> that owner <b>received from</b> the laborer. The employer is entitled to claim from the owner of the field the profit that owner gained from the work, but not the entire wages of the laborer. This indicates that one who says: Your wage is incumbent upon me, is responsible for the arrangement.",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> <b>where</b> the middleman <b>said to them:</b> The obligation to pay <b>your wages</b> is incumbent <b>upon the employer,</b> in which case they share responsibility for the payment and neither violates the prohibition.",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>Yehuda bar Mareimar</b> would <b>say to his attendant: Go hire workers for me and say to them: Your wages are upon the employer.</b> Yehuda bar Mareimar instructed the attendant to do this in order to avoid violating the prohibition of delaying payment of wages. <b>Mareimar and Mar Zutra would hire</b> workers <b>for each other</b> for the same reason.",
    "<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said: Those marketplace workers of Sura do not violate the prohibition</b> by Torah law <b>of delaying</b> payment of wages, in the event that they do not pay their employees immediately. This is because everyone <b>knows that they rely on the market day</b> to earn their money, and the employees are aware that they will not be paid on the same day that they worked. <b>But</b> he <b>certainly violates the prohibition</b> by rabbinic law <b>of: Do not delay,</b> if he withholds payment any later than the market day.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that <b>an hourly laborer collects</b> his wages <b>all night and all day. Rav says: An hourly laborer</b> who worked <b>by day collects</b> his wages <b>all</b> that <b>day,</b> while <b>an hourly laborer</b> who worked <b>by night collects</b> his wages <b>all</b> that <b>night. And Shmuel says: An hourly laborer</b> who worked <b>by day</b> indeed <b>collects</b> his wages <b>all</b> that <b>day, but an hourly laborer by night collects</b> his wages <b>all</b> that <b>night and all</b> the following <b>day.</b>",
    "<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>An hourly laborer collects</b> his wages <b>all night and all day.</b> This is apparently <b>a conclusive refutation of Rav.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>he teaches</b> the mishna <b>disjunctively</b> in the following manner: <b>An hourly laborer by day collects</b> his wages <b>all day,</b> while <b>an hourly laborer by night collects</b> his wages <b>all night.</b>",
    "<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>he was a weekly laborer, a monthly laborer, a yearly laborer,</b> or <b>a laborer</b> for a Sabbatical <b>cycle</b> of seven years, if he <b>left</b> upon the completion of his work <b>in the day, he collects</b> his wages <b>all day;</b> if he <b>left at night, he collects</b> his wages <b>all night and all day.</b> This indicates that one who finishes his work at night can be paid throughout the following day as well.",
    "The Gemara replies: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that it <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An hourly laborer by day collects</b> his wages <b>all day,</b> while <b>an hourly laborer by night collects</b> his wages <b>all night;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says: An hourly laborer by day collects</b> his wages <b>all day,</b> while <b>an hourly laborer by night collects</b> his wages <b>all night and all day.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated: Anyone who withholds the wages of a hired laborer violates these five</b> negative <b>prohibitions and</b> one <b>positive mitzva.</b> He <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not oppress your neighbor”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>of: “Do not steal”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> the <b>prohibition of: “You should not oppress a hired laborer who is poor”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:14), <b>and the prohibition of delaying</b> payment of wages (Leviticus 19:13), <b>and</b> he has not fulfilled the positive mitzva <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and</b> he has violated the prohibition <b>of: “The sun shall not set upon him”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15).",
    "The Gemara asks: But these five prohibitions do not all take effect at the same time, since <b>those that are</b> applicable <b>by day are not</b> in effect <b>by night,</b> while those <b>that are</b> applicable <b>by night are not</b> relevant <b>by day.</b> How can he be in violation of them all? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It means <b>merely</b> that <b>the general concept</b> of withholding the <b>wages</b> of a hired laborer includes all these prohibitions and one positive mitzva.",
    "§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> defined as <b>oppression and what is</b> defined as <b>stealing,</b> and what is the difference between them? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> If he told him: <b>Go and return, go and return</b> (see Proverbs 3:28), avoiding paying him while saying that he will pay him at some point, <b>this is oppression.</b> If he says to him: <b>You have</b> money owed to you <b>in my possession but I will not give</b> it <b>to you, this is stealing.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Sheshet objects to this</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> the type of <b>oppression for which the Torah obligated him</b> to bring <b>an offering?</b> It is <b>similar to</b> the case of one who had been entrusted with money as <b>a deposit, where he</b> then <b>denies</b> that he accepted it, thereby keeping <b>the money.</b> This contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s claim that oppression is referring to one who admits that he owes him. <b>Rather, Rav Sheshet said</b> that the difference is as follows: If he said to him: <b>I gave it to you, this is</b> defined as <b>oppression.</b> If he tells him: <b>You have</b> money owed to you <b>in my possession but I am not giving</b> it <b>to you, this is</b> defined as <b>stealing.</b>",
    "<b>Abaye objects to this: What is</b> the type of <b>stealing for which the Torah obligated him</b> to bring <b>an offering? We require</b> it to be <b>similar to</b> the case of one who had been entrusted with money as <b>a deposit, where he</b> then <b>denies</b> that he accepted it, thereby keeping <b>the money.</b> That is unlike the example of stealing given by Rav Ḥisda and Rav Sheshet, where the party withholding the money concedes that he owes it. <b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> If he said to him: <b>I never hired you, this is oppression;</b> if he claimed: <b>I gave it to you, this is stealing.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rav Sheshet, what is different</b> about <b>oppression that he raised a difficulty</b> against Rav Ḥisda concerning it, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>stealing that he did not raise a difficulty,</b> although Abaye’s question was similar to his. The Gemara explains: Rav Sheshet could have <b>said to you: Stealing</b> means <b>that</b> he first <b>stole from him</b> by stating that he will not give him the money, <b>and later denied</b> owing it.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> with regard to <b>oppression as well,</b> the case can be <b>that</b> he first conceded that he owes the wages <b>and</b> then <b>later denied it.</b> Why does Rav Sheshet say that the case must be where the employer said to the laborer: I gave it to you? The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted, there it is written:</b> “And if he deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, <b>or of robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:21), which <b>by inference</b> indicates <b>that he admitted to him at the outset. But with regard to oppression is it written: Or by oppression? It is written: “Or he oppressed,”</b> which does not refer back to his previous denial but is referring to the actual sin, indicating <b>that he had already oppressed him.</b>",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> There is no need for such an artificial distinction, as <b>oppression is the same as stealing,</b> and no practical difference exists between the two categories. <b>And why,</b> then, <b>did the verse divide them</b> into two categories? It did this <b>so that he will violate two prohibitions,</b> stealing and oppression.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Whether</b> referring to <b>a person’s wages</b> that he receives <b>or the renting of an animal or the renting of utensils,</b> are all <b>subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:15), <b>and</b> are <b>subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning”</b> (Leviticus 19:13). <b>When</b> does he transgress these prohibitions? He transgresses them <b>when</b> the one owed the money <b>claimed</b> the payment from <b>him.</b> If he <b>did not claim</b> his payment from <b>him</b> the other <b>does not transgress</b> the prohibitions. <b>If</b> the one who owes the money <b>transferred his</b> payment by leaving instructions <b>with a storekeeper or with a money changer</b> to pay him, <b>he does not transgress</b> the prohibitions.",
    "The mishna discusses other related <i>halakhot</i>: If <b>a hired laborer</b> requests payment <b>at</b> the proper <b>time</b> and the employer claims he already paid him, the laborer <b>takes an oath</b> that he did not receive his wages <b>and</b> then <b>takes</b> the wages from the employer. If <b>the time had passed,</b> he does <b>not take an oath and take</b> the wages. <b>If there are witnesses</b> who testify <b>that he claimed</b> the money from <b>him at</b> the proper <b>time, he takes an oath and takes</b> the money.",
    "One who hires <b>a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>] is subject to</b> the prohibition <b>of: “On the same day you shall give him his wages,” but is not subject to</b> the negative mitzva <b>of: “The wages of a hired laborer shall not remain with you all night until the morning.”</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not</b> that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i> of</b> the <i>baraita</i>, who interprets the phrase: <b>“From your brothers”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:14), <b>and</b> it is <b>not Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> this <i>baraita</i> that is referred to here? The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:"
