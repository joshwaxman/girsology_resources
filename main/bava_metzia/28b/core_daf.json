    "because perhaps one who hears him will <b>come to confuse</b> it <b>with the first</b> pilgrimage Festival? The Gemara answers: Confusing the second Festival with the first is not a problem, as in any case, <b>won’t</b> the finder <b>come</b> on the <b>third pilgrimage Festival,</b> thereby giving the owner another opportunity to recover his lost item?",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught: Initially, anyone who found a lost item would proclaim</b> his find for <b>three pilgrimage Festivals and</b> for <b>seven days after the last</b> of the three <b>pilgrimage Festivals, so that</b> its owner <b>will go to his home,</b> a trip lasting up to <b>three</b> days, <b>and will return</b> to Jerusalem, a trip lasting up to <b>three</b> days, <b>and proclaim</b> his loss for <b>one day.</b> But <b>from</b> the time <b>that the Temple was destroyed, may it be rebuilt speedily in our days,</b> the Sages <b>instituted that</b> those who find lost items <b>shall proclaim</b> their finds <b>in synagogues and study halls. And from</b> the time <b>that the oppressors proliferated,</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that</b> one who finds a lost item <b>shall inform his neighbors and acquaintances, and</b> that will <b>suffice for him.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>From</b> the time <b>that the oppressors proliferated?</b> The Gemara answers: It is from the time <b>that they say: A lost item</b> belongs <b>to the king.</b> The Sages were concerned that any public proclamation would result in confiscation of the lost item. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ami found a vessel</b> full <b>of dinars. A certain Roman saw that he was wary</b> and hesitant to take it. The Roman <b>said to him: Go, take it for yourself; as we are not Persians, who say that a lost item</b> belongs <b>to the king.</b>",
    "<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was a Claimant’s Stone in Jerusalem,</b> and <b>anyone who lost an item would be directed there and anyone who found a lost item would be directed there. This</b> finder would <b>stand and proclaim</b> his find <b>and that</b> owner <b>would stand and provide</b> its <b>distinguishing marks and take</b> the item. <b>And that is</b> the place about which <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ta’anit</i> 19a): <b>Go and see if the Claimant’s Stone has been obscured</b> by the rising water.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a claimant accurately <b>stated</b> what type of item <b>the lost item</b> that was found by another is, <b>but did not state,</b> i.e., describe, <b>its distinguishing marks,</b> the finder <b>shall not give</b> it <b>to him. And</b> in the case of <b>a swindler, even though he stated its distinguishing marks,</b> the finder <b>shall not give</b> the lost item <b>to him, as it is stated:</b> “And if your brother be not near you, and you know him not, then you shall bring it into your house, and it shall be with you <b>until your brother claims [<i>derosh</i>] it [<i>oto</i>],</b> and you shall return it to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2). Would it enter your mind that the finder would give it to him before he claims it? How can the finder return it if he does not know the identity of the owner? Rather, the verb <i>derosh</i> is not referring to the claim of the owner; it is referring to the scrutiny performed by the finder. You shall not return the lost item <b>until</b> you <b>scrutinize [<i>shetidrosh</i>] your brother</b> to determine <b>whether</b> he, the claimant, <b>is a swindler</b> or <b>whether he is not a swindler.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> One who finds an item <b>proclaims</b> that he found <b>a lost item</b> without specifying its nature. <b>And Rav Naḥman said:</b> He specifies the nature of the item, e.g., <b>he proclaims</b> that he found <b>a cloak.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> One who finds an item <b>proclaims</b> that he found <b>a lost item, as if you say</b> that <b>he proclaims</b> that he found <b>a cloak, we are concerned about</b> the possibility that <b>a swindler</b> may attempt to claim the item. Perhaps the swindler learned that another person lost that item, and he will ascertain its distinguishing marks, provide those distinguishing marks, and claim the item.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The finder <b>proclaims</b> that he found <b>a cloak, and we are not concerned about</b> the possibility that <b>a swindler</b> may attempt to claim the item, <b>as if so, there is no end to the matter.</b> Even if the finder does not specify the nature of the item, perhaps a swindler would be able to guess its nature.",
    "The Gemara cites proof from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If a claimant accurately <b>states</b> what type of item <b>the lost item</b> that was found by another is, <b>but did not state its distinguishing marks,</b> the finder <b>shall not give</b> it <b>to him. Granted, if you say</b> the finder <b>proclaims</b> that he found an unspecified <b>lost item, this</b> mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>even though</b> the claimant indeed <b>stated</b> that the lost item is <b>a cloak, as</b> long as <b>he did not state</b> its <b>distinguishing marks, we do not return</b> it <b>to him. But if you say</b> that the finder <b>proclaims</b> that he found <b>a cloak,</b> if the finder <b>stated</b> that he found <b>a cloak and</b> the claimant <b>stated</b> that he lost <b>a cloak,</b> does it <b>need to be said</b> that <b>when he did not state</b> its <b>distinguishing marks, we do not return it to him?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Safra said: Actually,</b> one could say that the finder <b>proclaims</b> that he found <b>a cloak,</b> and the mishna is referring to a case where the finder <b>stated</b> that he found <b>a cloak, and</b> the claimant <b>stated</b> its <b>distinguishing marks. And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase in the mishna: If he <b>did not state its distinguishing marks?</b> It means: If <b>he did not state its clear-cut distinguishing marks</b> but rather stated distinguishing marks that are not exclusive to the item. Therefore, he does not prove his ownership.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> in the case of <b>a swindler, even though he stated its distinguishing marks,</b> the finder <b>shall not give</b> the lost item <b>to him. The Sages taught: Initially, anyone who lost an item would provide</b> its <b>distinguishing marks and take it.</b> But <b>when the swindlers proliferated,</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that</b> the finders will <b>say to him: Go and bring witnesses</b> who can testify <b>that you are not a swindler, and take</b> your item.",
    "The Gemara relates: This is <b>as</b> in <b>that</b> incident involving <b>the father of Rav Pappa,</b> who <b>lost a donkey and</b> others <b>found it. He came before Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> to reclaim his donkey. Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said</b> to the father of Rav Pappa: <b>Go and bring witnesses</b> who can testify <b>that you are not a swindler, and</b> you may <b>take</b> your donkey. The father of Rav Pappa <b>went and brought witnesses.</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to</b> the witnesses: <b>Do you know about him</b> that <b>he is a swindler?</b> The witnesses <b>said: Yes.</b> Rav Pappa’s father <b>said,</b> incredulously, <b>to</b> the witnesses: <b>I am a swindler?</b> The witnesses <b>said to him: We were saying that you are not a swindler.</b> They had thought the question was if he was not a swindler, and therefore responded in the affirmative. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna said:</b> It <b>is reasonable</b> to conclude that the witnesses actually intended to support Rav Pappa’s father, because presumably, <b>a person does not bring condemnation upon himself;</b> Rav Pappa’s father would not have volunteered to provide witnesses who would testify against him.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one finds <b>any</b> living <b>being that works and</b> generates enough revenue to cover the costs of the food that it <b>eats,</b> it <b>shall work and eat</b> while in the finder’s possession. <b>And any</b> living <b>being that does not work but</b> it does <b>eat shall be sold, as it is stated:</b> “Then you shall bring it into your house, and it shall be with you until your brother claims it, <b>and you shall return it to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:2), indicating that the finder must <b>see how</b> best <b>to return it to him.</b> Since the owner must repay the finder for his expenditures, if feeding the animal costs more than its value, the finder’s keeping the animal in his possession will prevent the owner from recovering it.",
    "<b>What shall be</b> done <b>with the money</b> received from the sale of the animal? <b>Rabbi Tarfon says:</b> The finder <b>may use it; therefore, if</b> the money <b>is lost,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it. Rabbi Akiva says: He may not use</b> the money; <b>therefore, if it is lost,</b> he is <b>not liable</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that an animal that generates enough revenue to cover the costs of the food that it eats shall work and eat while in the finder’s possession. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> must he care for the animal <b>forever? Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> He cares for the animal <b>until twelve months</b> pass. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one finds <b>any</b> living <b>being that works and</b> generates enough revenue to cover the costs of the food that it <b>eats, e.g., a cow or a donkey,</b> he <b>tends to them until twelve months</b> pass. <b>From that</b> point <b>forward, one assesses their value,</b> sells them, <b>and places</b> the money aside for the owner.",
    "If one finds <b>calves and foals,</b> which are young and unfit for labor, <b>he tends to them</b> for <b>three months,</b> as they do not earn their keep. <b>From that</b> point <b>forward, one assesses their value,</b> sells them, <b>and places</b> the money aside for the owner. If one finds <b>geese and roosters, he tends to them</b> for <b>thirty days. From that</b> point <b>forward, one assesses their value,</b> sells them, <b>and places</b> the money aside for the owner.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> The legal status of <b>a chicken is like</b> that of <b>a large domesticated animal</b> in that the eggs it lays suffice to cover the cost of its food, and therefore the finder keeps it for twelve months. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one finds <b>a chicken and a large domesticated animal,</b> he <b>tends to them for twelve months. From that</b> point <b>forward, one assesses their value,</b> sells them, <b>and places</b> the money aside for the owner. If one finds <b>calves and foals, he tends to them</b> for <b>thirty days. From that</b> point <b>forward, one assesses their value,</b> sells them, <b>and places</b> the money aside for the owner. If one finds <b>geese and roosters and anything that</b> costs <b>more to tend to than</b> the <b>revenue</b> generated by <b>it, he tends to them</b> for <b>three days. From that</b> point <b>forward, one assesses their value,</b> sells them, <b>and places</b> the money aside for the owner.",
    "The Gemara asks: It is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction between the ruling in the first <i>baraita</i> that the finder keeps <b>calves and foals</b> for three months <b>and</b> the ruling in the second <i>baraita</i> that the finder keeps <b>calves and foals</b> for thirty days; and there is another contradiction between the ruling in the first <i>baraita</i> that the finder keeps <b>geese and roosters</b> for thirty days, <b>and</b> the ruling in the second <i>baraita</i> that the finder keeps <b>geese and roosters</b> for three days.",
    "The Gemara answers: The contradiction between the ruling in the first <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>calves and foals and</b> the ruling in the second <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>calves and foals</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling in the first <i>baraita</i> that the finder keeps them for three months is referring to calves and foals <b>that graze</b> in the pasture, <b>and that</b> ruling in the second <i>baraita</i> that the finder keeps them for thirty days is referring to calves and foals <b>that</b> need to be <b>fattened</b> and therefore require greater exertion on the part of the one who finds them.",
    "The contradiction between the ruling in the first <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>geese and roosters and</b> the ruling in the second <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>geese and roosters</b> is <b>also not difficult. This</b> ruling in the first <i>baraita</i> that the finder keeps them for thirty days is referring <b>to large</b> geese and roosters, which do not require great exertion, <b>and that</b> ruling in the second <i>baraita</i> that the finder keeps them for three days is referring <b>to small</b> geese and roosters, which require great exertion.",
    "The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> any living being <b>that does not work but</b> it does <b>eat</b> shall be sold. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And you shall return it to him”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:2), indicating that the finder must <b>see how</b> best <b>to return it to him,</b> meaning <b>that</b> one <b>shall not feed</b> the value of <b>a calf to</b> the lost <b>calves</b> that he is tending, <b>nor</b> the value of <b>a foal to</b> the lost <b>foals</b> that he is tending, <b>nor</b> the value of <b>a goose to</b> the <b>geese</b> that he is tending, <b>nor</b> the value of <b>a rooster to</b> the <b>roosters</b> that he is tending. Were the finder to do so, ultimately, the owner would receive nothing.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>What shall be</b> done <b>with the money</b> received from the sale of the animal? <b>Rabbi Tarfon says:</b> The finder <b>may use it;</b> therefore, if the money is lost, he is liable to pay restitution for its loss. Rabbi Akiva says: He may not use the money. Therefore, if it is lost, he is not liable to pay restitution. The Gemara analyzes the tannaitic dispute: Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva <b>disagree</b>"
