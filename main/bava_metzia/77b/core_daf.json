    "<b>he gives him his wage; if he is a contractor, he gives him his contracted</b> payment?",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>Whose</b> opinion does this <i>baraita</i> follow? <b>If we say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> rule that he receives his full payment <b>specifically</b> in a case when the laborer <b>heard that</b> a relative <b>of his died, or if</b> he <b>was gripped with fever, where he was</b> unable to work due to <b>circumstances beyond his control? When</b> he is <b>not</b> compelled by <b>circumstances beyond his control</b> to stop working, this should <b>also</b> be the <i>halakha</i>. After all, <b>the Rabbis said</b> that <b>the laborer is at an advantage. Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa? And</b> one can <b>learn from it</b> that <b>Rabbi Dosa</b> does <b>not differentiate between hired</b> work <b>and contracted</b> work in this regard.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The ruling of this <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a matter that involves financial loss</b> if the work is not completed. Consequently, the employer is at an advantage, unless the laborer is compelled to stop working due to circumstances beyond his control, in which case <b>everyone agrees</b> that he receives his full wages.",
    "<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Whoever changes</b> the terms accepted by both parties <b>is at a disadvantage, and whoever reneges</b> on an agreement <b>is at a disadvantage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the statement: <b>Whoever changes is at a disadvantage,</b> one can understand this, <b>as the <i>tanna</i> taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> indicating that this is the <i>halakha</i>. <b>But</b> concerning the clause: <b>Whoever reneges is at a disadvantage, what</b> does it serve <b>to add?</b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to add</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a <b>laborer, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa,</b> who holds that workers may not renege?",
    "Evidently, Rav’s ruling does not accord with the opinion of Rabbi Dosa. <b>Rather, Rabbi Dosa is saying two</b> <i>halakhot</i>, <b>and Rav holds in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>in one</b> matter <b>and disagrees with his</b> opinion <b>in one</b> matter. Rav does not agree with Rabbi Dosa’s ruling that laborers are at a disadvantage, but he does agree with him with regard to the manner of calculating wages.",
    "<b>If you wish, say</b> a different interpretation of the mishna. The phrase: <b>Whoever reneges is at a disadvantage,</b> is not discussing employment arrangements, but is referring <b>to that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whoever reneges</b> is at a disadvantage; <b>how so? If one sold a field to another for one thousand dinars, and</b> the buyer <b>gave him two hundred dinars</b> as a down payment, and then one of them reneged, <b>when the seller reneges on</b> his commitment, <b>the buyer is at an advantage.</b>",
    "Consequently, if the buyer <b>desires, he</b> may <b>say to him: Give me</b> back <b>my money</b> that I gave you as a down payment, <b>or give me land corresponding to</b> the value of <b>my money.</b> If you will not give me all the land as per our agreement, I should at least receive land in proportion to the money I already paid you. <b>From which</b> type of land <b>does</b> the seller <b>give</b> the buyer? <b>From superior-quality</b> land. <b>And when the buyer reneges, the seller is at an advantage:</b> If <b>he desires,</b> the seller <b>says to him: Take your money,</b> and if <b>he desires, he says to him: Take land corresponding to</b> the value of <b>your money</b> that you already paid. <b>From which</b> type of land <b>does</b> the seller <b>give</b> the buyer? Even <b>from inferior-quality</b> land.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: We teach them</b> from the outset <b>not to renege,</b> so that the agreement will not be canceled and end in conflict. <b>How so?</b> The seller <b>writes</b> for <b>him</b> a bill of sale that states: <b>I, so-and-so, son of so-and-so, sold such and such a field to so-and-so for one thousand dinars, and of them he gave me two hundred dinars. And</b> therefore, <b>now he owes me eight hundred dinars.</b> In this manner, the buyer <b>acquires</b> the entire field, <b>and</b> the buyer <b>returns the remaining</b> eight hundred dinars <b>to</b> the seller <b>even after several years.</b> The remainder of the payment for the field has been transformed into a standard written loan.",
    "<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From which</b> type of land <b>does</b> the seller <b>give</b> the buyer? <b>From superior-quality</b> land. It may <b>enter your mind</b> to say that this means <b>from</b> the most <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>of</b> all of the seller’s <b>property.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even if the buyer <b>is</b> considered to be like <b>only</b> a regular <b>creditor, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 48b) that <b>a creditor has the right</b> only <b>to intermediate-quality</b> land, not superior-quality land. <b>And furthermore,</b> there is <b>this</b> specific plot of <b>land, for which</b> the buyer <b>paid money.</b> Why should he receive superior-quality land?",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> When the <i>baraita</i> refers to the type of land that may be claimed after the buyer or seller reneges, it means <b>from</b> the most <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>that is in</b> the agreed-upon plot of land, or <b>from</b> the most <b>inferior-quality</b> land <b>that is in it.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means <b>from</b> the most <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>of</b> all of the seller’s <b>property,</b> as there is a specific reason why that should be the case here: <b>Ordinarily, one</b> who <b>buys land for one thousand dinars</b> will not have such a large sum on hand to carry out the transaction. Rather, he <b>will significantly reduce</b> the price of <b>his possessions and sell</b> them at a loss, so as to obtain the money. If the seller reneges and the buyer does not acquire this large plot of land, he will have suffered a significant loss, <b>and he will be like an injured</b> party, <b>and we learned</b> the same mishna: The court <b>appraises superior-quality</b> land <b>for payment to injured</b> parties. Therefore, in this case too, the seller must provide land of the highest quality.",
    "§ It is further stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: We teach them not to renege. How so? He writes for him: I, so-and-so, son of so-and-so,</b> sold such and such a field to so-and-so for one thousand dinars, and of them he gave me two hundred dinars. And therefore, now he owes me eight hundred dinars. This effects acquisition of the field for the buyer immediately. The Gemara asks: <b>The reason</b> they cannot renege <b>is that</b> the seller <b>wrote this for</b> the buyer in the contract. Evidently, <b>if not for this</b> being specified in a document the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the field immediately.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who gives a down payment to another, and says to him: If I renege, my down payment is forfeited to you, and the other</b> person <b>says to him: If I renege, I will double your down payment for you, the conditions are in effect;</b> i.e., the court will enforce the conditions stipulated between them in this contract. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says: A transaction with inconclusive consent [<i>asmakhta</i>] effects acquisition.</b> Even though it is a commitment that he undertook based on his certainty that he would never be forced to fulfill the condition, it is considered a full-fledged commitment.",
    "The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It is sufficient that</b> the down payment <b>effects acquisition</b> of merchandise <b>commensurate with</b> the amount of <b>his down payment. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>when</b> the buyer <b>said to</b> the seller: <b>My down payment will effect acquisition</b> of the merchandise. <b>But</b> if <b>one sold</b> another <b>a field for one thousand dinars, and</b> the buyer <b>paid him five hundred dinars of</b> that sum, he has <b>acquired</b> the entire field, <b>and he returns the rest</b> of the money <b>to</b> the seller <b>even after several years</b> have passed. Evidently, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains that even if they do not have an explicit contract, the buyer’s first payment finalizes the sale, rendering the remaining payment a standard loan. If so, why does the previous <i>baraita</i> state that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that this contract must be in writing?",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling, that the down payment serves to effect acquisition only if they specified in writing that the remaining payment would be considered a loan, is stated with regard to a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>goes in and goes out for money,</b> i.e., demonstrates that he is in need of cash. Therefore, unless the acquisition was stated in writing, the buyer acquires the entire field only when he pays the entire sum. <b>That</b> ruling, that the down payment effects full acquisition regardless of whether or not it is written in a contract, is stated with regard to a case <b>where he does not go in and go out for money.</b>",
    "This is <b>as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells</b> an item <b>to another and</b> then <b>goes in and goes out for money,</b> the buyer <b>has not acquired</b> it, as it is clear that the seller sold it only because he needed the money immediately. Since the seller did not receive the money he wanted right away, the transaction is null. <b>If he does not go in and go out for money,</b> the buyer <b>has acquired</b> it, and the rest of the payment is considered like a loan that must be repaid in the future.",
    "<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>one who lent one hundred dinars to another and</b> the borrower <b>paid it back one dinar at a time, this is</b> a valid <b>repayment. But</b> the lender <b>has</b> grounds for <b>a grievance against him</b> for repaying him in this manner, <b>as he</b> can <b>say to him: You have caused me to lose</b> out, as it is easier to use a lump sum than a few coins at a time.",
    "§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who sold his donkey to another, and one dinar was still owed to him, and</b> the seller <b>went in and went out for his dinar. Rav Ashi sat and examined this</b> situation, asking: In <b>a case like this, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Has <b>he acquired</b> the donkey <b>or</b> has <b>he not acquired</b> it? <b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: This is what Avimi of Hagronya said in the name of Rava: One dinar is considered</b> to be <b>like</b> multiple <b>dinars, and</b> therefore <b>he has not acquired</b> it.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi: But we say in the name of Rava</b> that in this case <b>he has acquired</b> it. Rav Ashi <b>said to him,</b> in resolution of the apparent contradiction between these two versions of Rava’s ruling: <b>Interpret your <i>halakha</i> with regard to</b> one who <b>sells his field</b>"
