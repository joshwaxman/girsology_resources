    "The Gemara answers that the statement in the mishna: Therefore, if the money is lost, he is liable to pay restitution for it, can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says</b> concerning another mishna (58a): When the <i>tanna</i> says that <b>they were stolen,</b> the reference is to a case where the item was stolen <b>by armed bandits;</b> when he says that <b>they were lost,</b> the reference is to a case where the agent’s <b>ship sank at sea.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon,</b> who said that it is permitted for the finder to use the money. The Gemara relates: There <b>were these dinars</b> that belonged <b>to orphans</b> that were <b>in the possession of Raḥava.</b> Raḥava <b>came before Rav Yosef</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>; is it permitted for me <b>to use</b> these dinars? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon.</b>",
    "<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Wasn’t it stated concerning this</b> <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The Sages <b>taught this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that it is permitted to use the money, <b>only in</b> a case of <b>money</b> received from the sale <b>of a lost item</b> that one found and that is no longer financially viable for one to tend to it. This is permitted, <b>since he exerted</b> himself and tended <b>to it. But</b> in the case of <b>lost coins, where he did not exert</b> himself in order to tend <b>to them,</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted for him to use them. <b>And</b> the case of <b>these</b> dinars in Raḥava’s possession <b>is similar</b> to a case of <b>lost coins.</b> Rav Yosef accepted Abaye’s objection and <b>said to</b> Raḥava: <b>Go;</b> as <b>they did not allow me to permit</b> the use of the dinars <b>for you.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>found scrolls, he reads them once in thirty days</b> in order to ventilate them and prevent mold. <b>And if he does not know</b> how <b>to read, he rolls</b> and unrolls <b>them</b> in order to ventilate them. <b>But he shall not study</b> passages <b>in them for the first time,</b> as he would leave the scroll exposed to the air for a lengthy period, thereby causing damage. <b>And another</b> person <b>shall not read</b> the scroll <b>with him,</b> as each might pull it closer to improve his vantage point, which could cause the scroll to tear.",
    "If one <b>found a garment, he shakes it once in thirty days, and he spreads it</b> out <b>for its sake,</b> to ventilate it, <b>but</b> he may <b>not</b> use it as a decoration <b>for his</b> own <b>prestige.</b>",
    "If one found <b>silver vessels or copper vessels,</b> he <b>may use them for their</b> own <b>sake</b> to prevent tarnish and rust, <b>but</b> he may <b>not</b> use them <b>to</b> the extent that he will <b>erode them.</b> If he finds <b>gold vessels or glass vessels,</b> which are not ruined by neglect, <b>he may not touch them until Elijah will come</b> and identify the owner.",
    "If a person <b>found a sack or a basket or any</b> other <b>item that</b> it <b>is not his</b> typical <b>manner to take</b> and carry because it is beneath his dignity, <b>he</b> shall <b>not take</b> it, as one need not demean himself in order to return a lost item.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says: One who finds phylacteries in the marketplace</b> and is in need of phylacteries <b>assesses their value and immediately places</b> the money aside for the owner.",
    "<b>Ravina raises an objection</b> from the mishna: If one <b>found scrolls, he reads them once in thirty days; and if he does not know</b> how <b>to read, he rolls</b> and unrolls <b>them.</b> Ravina infers: To <b>roll</b> and unroll <b>them, yes,</b> he may do so, but <b>assess their value and place</b> the money aside, <b>no,</b> he may not. <b>Abaye said:</b> There is a difference between phylacteries and scrolls. <b>Phylacteries are available at the house of bar Ḥavu,</b> where they are produced in large quantities, but <b>scrolls are not available,</b> as Torah scrolls are not easily obtained.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who borrows a Torah scroll from another, that</b> person <b>may not lend it to another,</b> i.e., a third person. He <b>may open it and read it, provided that he does not study</b> passages <b>in it for the first time,</b> lest the scroll be exposed for a lengthy period of time and sustain damage. <b>And another</b> person <b>shall not read</b> the scroll <b>with him,</b> lest the scroll tear.",
    "<b>And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>one who deposits a Torah scroll with another,</b> the bailee <b>rolls it every twelve months,</b> and he <b>may open it and read it. If</b> it is <b>for himself</b> that <b>he opened it,</b> it is <b>prohibited. Sumakhos says: In</b> the case of <b>a new</b> Torah scroll, one rolls it every <b>thirty days</b> because the ink is not yet dry and must be more frequently ventilated. By contrast, <b>in</b> the case of <b>an old</b> Torah scroll, one rolls it every <b>twelve months. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the case of <b>both this</b> new Torah scroll, <b>and</b> the case of <b>that</b> old Torah scroll, one rolls it every <b>twelve months.</b>",
    "The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> In the case of <b>one who borrows a Torah scroll from another, that</b> person <b>may not lend it to another,</b> i.e., a third person. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did the <i>tanna</i> teach this <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> with regard to a <b>Torah scroll?</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>any item as well, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Here</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 29a), <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught: A borrower is not allowed to lend</b> the item that he borrowed to someone else, <b>and a renter is not allowed to rent out</b> the item that he rented to someone else.",
    "The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention the <i>halakha</i> specifically with regard to <b>a Torah scroll, lest you say</b> that <b>a person is amenable to having a mitzva performed with his property</b> and would consequently not mind if his Torah scroll was lent to another. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the borrower may not lend even a Torah scroll.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: He <b>may open it and read it.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? And rather, for what</b> purpose did he <b>borrow</b> the Torah scroll <b>from him,</b> if not to read it? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach <b>the last clause: Provided that he does not study</b> passages <b>in it for the first time.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>one who deposits a Torah scroll with another,</b> the bailee <b>rolls it every twelve months,</b> and he <b>may open it and read it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the bailee <b>doing with it?</b> As a paid bailee, he has no right to read it. <b>And furthermore,</b> whereas the <i>tanna</i> teaches: <b>If</b> it is <b>for himself</b> that <b>he opened it,</b> it is <b>prohibited, didn’t you say</b> in the previous passage: <b>He may open it and read it?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: If, when he is rolling</b> the Torah scroll to ventilate it, <b>he opens it and reads it,</b> it is <b>permitted. If</b> it is <b>for himself</b> that <b>he opened it,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Sumakhos says: In</b> the case of <b>a new</b> Torah scroll, one rolls it every <b>thirty days</b> because the ink is not yet dry and must be more frequently ventilated. By contrast, <b>in</b> the case of <b>an old</b> Torah scroll, one rolls it every <b>twelve months. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In <b>both</b> the case of <b>this</b> new Torah scroll <b>and</b> the case of <b>that</b> old Torah scroll, one rolls it every <b>twelve months.</b> The Gemara asks: What is the dispute here; it appears that the statement of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov is</b> identical to the statement of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who stated without qualification that one rolls a Torah scroll every twelve months. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather say</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: Both</b> in the case of <b>this</b> new Torah scroll <b>and</b> the case of <b>that</b> old Torah scroll, one rolls it every <b>thirty days.</b>",
    "§ The Gemara resumes its analysis of the mishna, which teaches with regard to borrowed scrolls: <b>But he shall not study</b> passages <b>in them for the first time and another</b> person <b>shall not read</b> the scroll <b>with him.</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:31): If one borrows a scroll, <b>he shall not read a passage and review it, and he shall not read a passage in it and translate</b> the passage, <b>and he shall not open it more than three columns</b> at a time, <b>and three people shall not read in it</b> together <b>from one volume.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>But two people may read</b> it together, contrary to the ruling in the mishna.",
    "<b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where it is inferred from the <i>baraita</i> that two may read one scroll together, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> they are reading <b>one matter</b> and each is aware of the progress of the other. <b>There,</b> in the mishna, where the ruling is that two may not read one scroll together, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> they are reading <b>two</b> different <b>matters,</b> as each is oblivious to the progress of the other and may pull the scroll closer to improve his vantage point.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>found a garment, he shakes it once in thirty days.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that shaking</b> a garment <b>is beneficial for it? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> Only <b>one who has</b> access to <b>a skilled weaver [<i>gardi</i>] in his house may shake his garment every day,</b> as the weaver can replace the damaged garments with new ones. The Sages <b>say:</b> Shaking a garment <b>every day is harmful to it,</b> but shaking it <b>once in thirty days is beneficial for it.</b>",
    "<b>If you wish, say</b> instead: It is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> mishna, where the ruling is that shaking a garment is beneficial, the reference is to a case <b>where one</b> person shakes the garment. <b>And that</b> statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who rules that shaking the garment causes damage, is referring to a case <b>where two</b> people shake the garment.",
    "<b>If you wish, say</b> instead: It is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> mishna, where the ruling is that shaking a garment is beneficial, the reference is to a case where one shakes the garment <b>by hand. And that</b> statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who rules that shaking the garment causes damage, is referring to a case where one shakes the garment <b>with a stick.</b>",
    "<b>If you wish, say</b> instead: It is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> mishna, where the ruling is that shaking a garment is beneficial, the reference is to a case <b>where</b> one shakes a garment made <b>of wool. And that</b> statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who rules that shaking the garment causes damage, is referring to a case <b>where</b> one shakes a garment made <b>of linen.</b>",
    "The Gemara cites additional statements by Rabbi Yoḥanan providing practical advice. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is preferable to drink from <b>a cup of witches and not</b> to drink from <b>a cup of lukewarm</b> water, which is extremely unhealthy. Rabbi Yoḥanan qualifies his statement: <b>We said this only with regard to</b> lukewarm water <b>in metal vessels, but in earthenware vessels we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And even in metal vessels, we said this only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the water had <b>not</b> been <b>boiled, but</b> if the water had been <b>boiled we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And we said</b> that lukewarm water is unhealthy <b>only</b> in a case where <b>one did not cast flavorings into</b> the water, <b>but if he cast flavorings into</b> the water <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>one whose father bequeathed him a great deal of money and he seeks to lose it,</b> he <b>should wear linen garments, and should use glass vessels, and should hire laborers and not sit with them</b> to supervise. The Gemara elaborates: <b>He should wear linen garments;</b> this is stated <b>with regard to Roman linen,</b> which becomes tattered quickly. <b>He should use glass vessels;</b> this is stated <b>with regard to</b> expensive <b>white glass. And he should hire laborers and not sit with them; the explanation is</b>"
