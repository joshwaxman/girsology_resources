    "<b>why</b> does one <b>go back and take the collateral</b> again, as the creditor must anyway restore it to the debtor the following day? The Gemara replies: Any loan that is secured by collateral is not canceled by the Sabbatical Year, in contrast to other debts, which are canceled. Therefore, this ensures <b>that the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>should not cancel it. And</b> an additional reason is so that the collateral <b>should not become movable property</b> in the possession <b>of his children,</b> as one generally cannot claim such items from orphans to pay for their father’s debt.",
    "The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> these exceptions apply is <b>that</b> he <b>goes back and takes it as collateral; but</b> if he did <b>not go back and take it as collateral,</b> these exceptions do <b>not</b> apply. This <i>baraita</i> therefore contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, who held that the initial seizing of collateral is sufficient to grant the creditor full rights to it.",
    "<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said: And did you not resolve</b> this <i>baraita</i> once already by adjusting its wording slightly? <b>Answer</b> it by changing its formulation again in <b>this</b> manner: <b>And since</b> one must <b>return</b> the collateral, <b>why</b> does one <b>take collateral at the outset?</b> It is done so <b>that the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>should not cancel</b> the debt, <b>and</b> so that it <b>should not become movable property</b> in the possession <b>of his children.</b> This version is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as it teaches that one who has taken collateral even on a single occasion may confiscate it from the debtor’s heirs.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, <b>you shall not go into his house to take his collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:10). This verse indicates that <b>you may not enter his house, but you</b> may <b>enter the house of a guarantor</b> to take collateral from him. <b>And similarly it states: “Take his garment that is a surety for a stranger”</b> (Proverbs 20:16).",
    "<b>And it</b> further <b>states</b> with regard to the same issue: <b>“My son, if you are a guarantor for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands for a stranger, you are ensnared by the words of your mouth; you are caught by the words of your mouth. Do this, now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you have come into the hand of your friend; go humble yourself and strengthen your friend”</b> (Proverbs 6:1–3).",
    "This passage in Proverbs is interpreted as follows: The phrase “You are snared by the words of your mouth” is referring to a guarantor who obligated himself to pay or one who upset his friend with his comments. In such a case, one should do the following: <b>If he has money in your hand,</b> “go humble yourself [<i>hitrapes</i>],” which is expounded as: <b>Release for him the palm of your hand [<i>hatter lo pissat yad</i>]</b> to give him his money. <b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> money that you owe him, but rather you have “become ensnared by the words of your mouth” and owe him an apology for a personal slight, <b>gather together many neighbors</b> through which to seek <b>his</b> forgiveness.",
    "The verse “When you lend your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall not go into his house to take his collateral” can be interpreted <b>in a different direction,</b> i.e., in another manner: <b>You may not enter his house</b> to take collateral for the loan, <b>but</b> if he owes wages, <b>you may enter</b> and take collateral <b>for a porter’s wages, for a donkey driver’s wages, for an innkeeper’s payment,</b> or <b>for the wages for</b> one who made <b>drawings [<i>diyokanaot</i>]</b> for him. One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even</b> if the one owed the money <b>establishes it as a loan for</b> the one who owes the money after he was already liable for such payment. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Any manner</b> of loan” (Deuteronomy 24:10), which demonstrates that once the debt has been converted into a loan, it is like any other loan, and therefore one may not take collateral against the debtor’s will.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a widow, whether she is poor</b> or <b>whether she is wealthy,</b> one <b>may not take collateral from her, as it is stated: “And you may not take the garment of a widow as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:17).",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>a widow, whether she is poor</b> or <b>whether she is wealthy,</b> one <b>may not take collateral from her.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to <b>a wealthy</b> widow, one may <b>take collateral from her.</b> But with regard to <b>a poor</b> widow, one may <b>not take collateral from her,</b> because <b>you</b> are <b>obligated to return</b> it <b>to her,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that the collateral of a poor person must be returned to him whenever he needs it. <b>And</b> since you will be entering every day to return the collateral to her, <b>you</b> will thereby <b>give her a bad name among her neighbors,</b> as they will suspect her of developing an inappropriate relationship with you. By contrast, in the case of a wealthy widow, since there is no obligation to return her collateral, it is permitted to take collateral from her.",
    "The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that Rabbi Yehuda does not interpret the rationale</b> behind the mitzva <b>in the verse</b> and draw halakhic conclusions based on that interpretation, and <b>Rabbi Shimon does interpret the rationale</b> behind the mitzva <b>in the verse? But</b> haven’t we <b>heard them</b> holding <b>the reverse</b> opinions elsewhere?",
    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 21a) concerning the mitzvot of a king: <b>“And he should not multiply wives for himself,</b> that his heart not turn away” (Deuteronomy 17:17). <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He</b> may <b>accumulate many</b> wives <b>for himself, provided that they are not</b> like those who <b>turn his heart</b> from reverence for God. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even one who turns his heart away, he should not marry her. If so, why is it stated: “He shall not multiply wives for himself”?</b> This teaches that <b>even</b> with regard to wives <b>like Abigail,</b> who was righteous and prevented David from sin (see I Samuel chapter 25), he is forbidden to have many. In this case, Rabbi Shimon does not interpret the rationale of the verse, while Rabbi Yehuda does interpret its rationale.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, Rabbi Yehuda does not</b> generally <b>interpret the rationale of the verse, and</b> it <b>is different here,</b> with regard to a king, <b>as the verse</b> itself <b>specifies</b> the reason: <b>“And he should not multiply wives for himself, that</b> his heart <b>not turn away.” What is the reason</b> that <b>he may not multiply wives for himself?</b> It is <b>because</b> he must ensure <b>that</b> his heart <b>will not turn away.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> maintains: <b>Since we generally interpret the rationale in the verse,</b> there is no need for the verse itself to supply the rationale for the prohibition. <b>Let the Merciful One state: “He may not multiply,” and we do not need</b> the Torah to add “that his heart <b>not turn away,” and I</b> would already <b>know</b> the answer to the question: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he may not accumulate</b> many wives? It is <b>because</b> of the concern that his heart <b>not turn away.</b> If so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase “His heart <b>not turn away” that the Merciful One writes?</b> It must certainly be necessary in order to increase the scope of the prohibition: <b>Even</b> if there is <b>one</b> woman who <b>turns his heart away, he may not marry her.</b> Therefore, the verse includes two <i>halakhot</i>: A general stricture against a king’s marrying too many women, and a further <i>halakha</i> that a king may not marry even one woman who will lead him astray.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who takes a millstone as collateral violates a prohibition, and</b> he is <b>liable for</b> taking <b>two vessels,</b> i.e., both millstones in the pair, <b>as it is stated: “He shall not take the lower or upper millstone as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6). The <i>tanna</i> adds: <b>Not only</b> did the Sages <b>say</b> that it is prohibited to take <b>the lower or upper millstone</b> as collateral, <b>but</b> they also said that one may not take <b>anything that</b> people <b>use in the preparation of food [<i>okhel nefesh</i>], as it is stated: “For he takes a man’s life [<i>nefesh</i>] as collateral”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:6).",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says:</b> One who <b>took a lower millstone as collateral is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes: One set is <b>due to</b> violating the prohibition of taking the <b>lower millstone</b> as collateral, <b>and</b> the second is <b>due to: “For he takes a man’s life as collateral,”</b> since he took an item used in the preparation of food. If he took <b>the lower and upper millstone,</b> he <b>is flogged</b> with <b>three</b> sets of lashes: Two sets are <b>due to</b> violating the prohibitions of taking <b>a lower millstone and an upper millstone</b> as collateral, <b>and</b> the third is <b>due to</b> violating the prohibition: <b>“For he takes a man’s life as collateral.”</b>",
    "<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> If he <b>took a lower millstone as collateral he is flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes, if he took <b>an upper millstone he is flogged</b> with <b>one</b> set of lashes, and if he took both <b>the lower and upper millstones</b> together as collateral <b>he is flogged</b> with <b>two</b> sets of lashes. With regard to the verse: <b>“For he takes a man’s life as collateral,”</b>"
