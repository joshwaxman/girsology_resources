    "<b>He safeguarded them</b> in the manner <b>that people safeguard,</b> and he is not required to do anything more. <b>Abaye said to him: If that is so,</b> in a case where <b>he entered the city at a time when</b> other <b>people enter,</b> as shepherds normally do, when their animals are grazing in a quiet and safe place, and a theft occurred at that hour, <b>so too</b> will you say that he is <b>exempt?</b> Rabba <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Abaye raised a further difficulty: If <b>he slept a little at a time when people</b> generally <b>sleep, so too</b> is he <b>exempt?</b> Rabba <b>said to him: Yes.</b>",
    "Abaye <b>raised an objection to him</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are</b> the <b>circumstances beyond one’s control for which a paid bailee is exempt: For example,</b> as it is stated in the verse: “The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys feeding beside them. <b>And the Sabeans made a raid and took them away, and they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword”</b> (Job 1:15). This teaches that only a robbery by an army is considered a circumstance beyond his control, but nothing less. Rabba <b>said to him: There</b> it is referring <b>to city watchmen,</b> i.e., professionals hired to watch over city property, who are exempt due to an occurrence on that scale, i.e., a military incursion.",
    "Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabba from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>To what extent is a paid bailee obligated to safeguard?</b> He is obligated <b>to the extent</b> that Jacob said to Laban: <b>“Thus I was: In the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night”</b> (Genesis 31:40). Rava <b>said to him: There too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>of city watchmen,</b> whose responsibility extends further. Abaye <b>said to him: Is that to say</b> that <b>Jacob, our forefather,</b> whose statement is the source of this <i>halakha</i>, <b>was a city watchman?</b> Rava replied: It means <b>that</b> Jacob <b>said to Laban: I safeguarded for you an extra</b> level of <b>safeguarding, like</b> that of <b>city watchmen.</b>",
    "Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabba from another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a shepherd who was herding</b> the animals of others, <b>and he left his flock and came to the town,</b> if in the meantime <b>a wolf came and tore</b> an animal to pieces, <b>or a lion came and trampled</b> one of his flock, <b>we do not say</b> definitively that <b>had he been there he would have rescued</b> them and therefore he is liable due to his absence. <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>estimates</b> with regard to <b>him: If he could</b> have <b>rescued</b> his animal by chasing a beast of this kind away, he is <b>liable,</b> as his departure from the scene was certainly a contributing factor to the damage. <b>If not,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability.",
    "Abaye continues: <b>What, is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>when</b> the shepherd <b>enters</b> the town <b>at a time when</b> other <b>people</b> usually <b>enter?</b> If so, it presents a difficulty to the opinion of Rabba. Rabba responds: <b>No,</b> it is speaking <b>of one who enters at a time when</b> other <b>people do not</b> usually <b>enter.</b> Abaye retorts: <b>If so, why is he exempt</b> even if he could not have rescued the animal? This is a mishap that came about <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> and in a case of this kind he is <b>liable</b> due to his negligence.",
    "Rabba explains: It is referring to one <b>who heard the sound of a lion</b> roaring <b>and entered</b> the city to save himself. In such a case, his actions were not initially negligent, but rather, it was a circumstance beyond his control. Abaye questions this response: <b>If so,</b> what is the relevance of the statement: The court <b>estimates</b> with regard to <b>him? What could he have done</b> to prevent an attack by a lion? Rabba replies: <b>He should have faced</b> the lion <b>with</b> other <b>shepherds and with sticks</b> to chase it away.",
    "Abaye asks: <b>If so, why specifically</b> state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a paid bailee?</b> The same would hold true <b>even</b> for <b>an unpaid bailee, as wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said</b> that <b>an unpaid bailee who had</b> the option <b>of facing</b> an animal <b>with</b> other <b>shepherds and with sticks and did not face</b> it in this manner is <b>liable,</b> as he is considered negligent in his duty? Rabba answers: <b>An unpaid bailee</b> is liable only if he could have gathered together other shepherds to help him defend his animals <b>free of charge,</b> whereas <b>a paid bailee</b> is obligated to do so even <b>for payment.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And up to how much</b> must a paid bailee pay for this extra protection? The Gemara answers: <b>Up to</b> the sum <b>of the value</b> of the animals he is responsible to safeguard. The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> in that case, it seems that a paid bailee must pay from his own pocket to protect the animals from marauding beasts; <b>where have we found with regard to a paid bailee that he is liable for circumstances beyond his control?</b> Everyone agrees that this loss was caused by circumstances beyond the bailee’s control, and yet he must bear the expenses indirectly. The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he may return and take the money</b> that he paid for these additional guards <b>from the owner.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If so, what benefit does</b> the owner of the animals receive <b>from this?</b> Any potential loss he avoided from the lion must be paid to the extra guards. Abaye replied: The practical <b>difference</b> concerns <b>the fitness of</b> and his familiarity with <b>the animals.</b> Although it makes no difference to him financially, if he had to purchase other animals he would lose those animals that he knows, and he would rather keep his own livestock. <b>Alternatively,</b> it matters with respect <b>to the additional effort</b> involved in the acquisition of new animals.",
    "As demonstrated in the above discussion, Rabba maintains that even a paid bailee is required to safeguard and take care of the animals only in the normal fashion. By contrast, <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna do not hold in accordance with this</b> opinion <b>of Rabba, as they say</b> that the owner can tell the bailee: It was <b>for this</b> reason that <b>I gave you a wage, so that you should safeguard for me</b> with <b>an additional</b> level of <b>safeguarding,</b> not for you to go and eat and sleep like other people.",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>Bar Adda the porter was transporting animals across the narrow bridge of Neresh</b> when <b>one</b> animal <b>pushed another and cast it into the water,</b> and it drowned. The case <b>came before Rav Pappa,</b> who <b>deemed him liable.</b> Bar Adda <b>said to him: What should I have done?</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: You should have transported them one by one.</b> The porter <b>said to him: Do you know of the son of your sister who can transport</b> them <b>one by one?</b> In other words, are you aware of anyone who can do such a thing? It is virtually impossible. Rav Pappa <b>said to him: The very earliest</b> scholars <b>before you already shouted</b> and complained about this, <b>but none paid attention to them.</b> Since you are an expert and were hired for this purpose, the responsibility is yours.",
    "The Gemara relates another incident: <b>Aivu deposited flax</b> with a bailee in the <b>house of Ronya.</b> A robber called <b>Shabbu went and</b> forcibly <b>snatched</b> the flax <b>from him. Eventually the thief was identified</b> and caught. The matter <b>came before Rav Naḥman,</b> who <b>rendered</b> the bailee <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that Rav Naḥman <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav Huna bar Avin?</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: <b>As Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> this ruling: In a case where an animal <b>was stolen in a circumstance beyond his control, and the thief was subsequently identified</b> and captured, <b>if</b> the bailee <b>is an unpaid bailee,</b> the following distinction applies: If <b>he wishes, he takes an oath</b> that he did not misappropriate the animal before it was stolen, and the owners must claim its value from the thief; if <b>he wishes, he enters into judgment with</b> the thief, by claiming the money directly from him. <b>If he is a paid bailee, he enters into judgment with</b> the thief <b>and does not take an oath.</b> Since the ruling of Rav Naḥman was in the case of an unpaid bailee, why did he have to deal with the thief?",
    "<b>Rava said:</b> The cases are not the same, as <b>there,</b> in the ruling of Rav Naḥman, <b>men from the government were standing there,</b> which means <b>that if he had raised his voice they would have come and rescued him.</b> Since it was his own negligence that caused the robbery, he must find a way to collect the money from the robber.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One wolf</b> that approaches a flock and attacks <b>is not</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control,</b> as the shepherd can drive it away, but an attack by <b>two wolves</b> is considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control. Rabbi Yehuda says: At a time of wolf attacks,</b> when many wolves come out of hiding and pounce on animals at every corner, <b>even</b> an attack by <b>one wolf is</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control.</b>",
    "An attack by <b>two dogs is not</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control. Yadua the Babylonian says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> If the two dogs came and attacked <b>from one direction it is not</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control,</b> but if they attacked <b>from two directions,</b> this is considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control,</b> as the shepherd cannot protect his flock from both of them at once. If <b>bandits</b> came, <b>this is</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control.</b> Likewise, with regard to an attack by <b>a lion, a bear, a leopard, a cheetah, and a snake, these are</b> each considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control.</b>",
    "<b>When</b> is an attack by one of the above considered beyond his control, which means that a paid bailee is exempt? It is <b>when</b> the dangerous beasts or bandits <b>came of their own accord</b> to the usual grazing spot. <b>But</b> if the shepherd <b>led</b> his flock <b>to a place of groups of beasts or bandits,</b> this <b>is not</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control,</b> as he is at fault.",
    "If the animal <b>died in its normal manner, this is</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control;</b> if <b>he afflicted it</b> by overworking it or by negligent treatment <b>and it died,</b> this <b>is not</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control.</b> If the animal <b>ascended to the top of a cliff and fell</b> down and died, <b>this is</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control.</b> If the shepherd himself <b>brought it up to the top of a cliff and it fell</b> down <b>and died,</b> this is <b>not</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that an attack by <b>one wolf is</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: That</b> <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>of a time of wolf attacks, and it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna.",
    "The mishna teaches that if <b>bandits came, this is</b> considered <b>a circumstance beyond one’s control.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why? Let one man stand against another man.</b> The shepherd should defend his flock and fight the bandit, as that is what he was hired to do. <b>Rav said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to armed bandits,</b> against whom the shepherd cannot reasonably defend the flock.",
    "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the case involved <b>an armed bandit and an armed shepherd, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say, let one man stand</b> and fight <b>against another man, or perhaps this</b> bandit is willing to <b>risk his life and that</b> shepherd <b>is not</b> prepared to <b>risk his life?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason that this one</b> will <b>risk his life and that one</b> would <b>not risk his life.</b> Consequently, the shepherd is not held responsible if he refuses to fight the bandit. <b>Abaye said to Rava:</b> What is the <i>halakha</i> if the <b>shepherd found</b> a known thief <b>and said to him: You dirty thief! In such and such a place we</b> shepherds <b>sit;</b>"
