    "<b>What</b> <i>halakha</i> can be derived from the seemingly superfluous second letter <i>lamed</i>, which renders the expression: <b>“You shall not curse [<i>tekallel</i>]”? Conclude from it</b> that this expression includes <b>two</b> prohibitions: A prohibition against cursing God and a prohibition against cursing a judge.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who engages in intercourse with a betrothed young woman is not liable</b> to be executed by stoning <b>unless she is a young woman,</b> i.e., neither a minor nor an adult; <b>a virgin; betrothed</b> but not yet married; <b>and she</b> lives <b>in her father’s home,</b> having yet to move in with her husband. If <b>two</b> men <b>engaged in intercourse with her, the first</b> is liable to be executed <b>by stoning, and the second</b> is liable to be executed <b>by strangulation.</b> The second man is executed in this manner in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of one who engages in intercourse with a married or non-virgin betrothed woman, as she was no longer a virgin when he engaged in intercourse with her.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the conditions stated in the mishna: The punishment of stoning applies only if the woman is <b>a young woman,</b> a category that applies until she is approximately twelve-and-a-half years of age, <b>but not a grown woman.</b> She must be <b>a virgin but not a non-virgin.</b> She must be <b>betrothed but not married.</b> She must be living <b>in her father’s home, excluding</b> a case <b>where the father transferred</b> his daughter <b>to the husband’s agents</b> to bring her to her husband’s home for the purpose of marriage; in such a case, even though she has not arrived there yet, she is already considered a married woman according to <i>halakha</i>.",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: This</b> mishna is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that the <i>halakha</i> of a betrothed young woman applies to a young woman of the intermediate age between minority and adulthood. <b>But the Rabbis say: Even a minor is included in</b> the term: <b>A betrothed young woman;</b> only a grown woman is excluded.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: From where</b> is it indicated <b>that the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and</b> the specification that she must be a young woman is not only to the exclusion of a grown woman but <b>also to the exclusion of a minor girl? Perhaps</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> the condition that she must be a young woman is <b>to the exclusion of a grown woman and nothing more.</b> Accordingly, one who engages in intercourse with an engaged minor girl is liable to be executed by stoning.",
    "Ravina <b>said to him: This</b> expression in the mishna: <b>Is not liable unless she is [<i>ad shetehe</i>] a young woman, a virgin, betrothed,</b> does not suit your suggested explanation. If the mishna is merely excluding a grown woman, <b>it should have</b> stated: <b>Is liable only for</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a young woman</b> who is <b>a virgin</b> and <b>betrothed.</b> The expression <i>ad shetehe</i> indicates: Until she becomes, i.e., this <i>halakha</i> does not apply until she reaches the age of a young woman. <b>And</b> there is <b>nothing more</b> to be said on the matter, as this is clearly the intention of the mishna.",
    "<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Adda asked Rav:</b> In the case of a man who <b>engaged in intercourse with a betrothed minor girl, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir? Does</b> Rabbi Meir <b>exclude him</b> from punishment <b>entirely, or does he exclude him</b> merely <b>from stoning</b> but he is executed by strangulation, like one who engages in intercourse with any other married woman? Rav <b>said to him: It stands to reason</b> that Rabbi Meir <b>excludes him from stoning</b> alone, but he is liable to be executed by strangulation.",
    "Rabbi Ya’akov bar Adda raised an objection to this answer: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, <b>then they shall both die,</b> the man who lies with the woman, and the woman” (Deuteronomy 22:22), indicating that this punishment does not apply <b>unless they are both equally</b> subject to punishment? If so, one who engages in intercourse with a betrothed minor girl is exempt, as she is not halakhically competent. <b>Rav remained silent</b> and did not answer him.",
    "<b>Shmuel says: What is the reason</b> that <b>Rav remained silent? Why not say to</b> Rabbi Ya’akov that his premise is repudiated by the verse: “But if the man finds the betrothed young woman in the field, and the man takes hold of her, and lies with her, <b>then the man who lay with her alone shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:25)? This verse proves that the punishment of stoning applies to the man even if the woman is exempt. The <i>halakha</i> of a man who engages in intercourse with a betrothed minor should be the same.",
    "The Gemara answers that this matter is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Then they shall both die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:22), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> does not apply <b>unless they are both equally</b> subject to punishment. If one of them cannot be punished, e.g., because he or she is a minor, the other is not executed either. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya. Rabbi Yonatan says</b> that the phrase from the verse <b>“then the man who lay with her alone shall die”</b> indicates that in some cases only one of them is liable to receive the death penalty.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what does the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yonatan, who holds that this punishment applies even if only one party is subject to punishment, <b>derive from</b> the verse: <b>“Then they shall both die”? Rava says:</b> That verse is stated <b>to exclude an act of sharpening,</b> i.e., engaging in sexual contact with a woman without penetration. Since the man and woman do not equally receive pleasure from such an act, it is not considered sexual intercourse, and they are exempt. <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yoshiya, holds that <b>an act of sharpening is nothing;</b> there is clearly no liability for such an act, and it is unnecessary to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the verse.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what does the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yoshiya, who holds that they must be equally subject to punishment, <b>derive from</b> the verse “Then the man who lay with her <b>alone</b> shall die”?",
    "The Gemara answers: He derives another <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>ten men engaged in intercourse with</b> a betrothed young woman, <b>and she is still a virgin,</b> as they engaged in anal intercourse with her, <b>they are all</b> liable to be executed <b>by stoning. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The first</b> of them is executed <b>by stoning, and all</b> the rest <b>of them</b> are executed <b>by strangulation.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi derives from the phrase in the verse “Then the man who lay with her alone shall die” that although the woman is still a virgin, only one man can be executed by stoning for engaging in intercourse with her. The others are executed by strangulation, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> of one who engages in intercourse with a married woman or a betrothed non-virgin.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes [<i>teḥel</i>] herself by playing the harlot,</b> she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The word <i>teḥel</i> means <b>first [<i>teḥila</i>]; and likewise it says: “Then the man who lay with her alone shall die”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:25).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>saying? Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that only the <b>betrothed</b> daughter of a priest <b>is singled out for</b> execution by <b>burning, but not</b> one who is <b>married;</b> a married daughter of a priest who commits adultery is executed in the same manner as other women who commit adultery. <b>And this</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying: If</b> a woman’s <b>first</b> act of <b>sexual intercourse</b> occurs <b>when</b> she commits <b>adultery,</b> as she is still betrothed, she is executed <b>by burning;</b> in <b>another</b> case, i.e., if she is already married and this is not the first time she engages in sexual intercourse, she is executed <b>by strangulation.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the end of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement: <b>And likewise</b> it says: “Then the man who lay with her alone shall die”? What is the relevance of that verse to this issue? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi means to say that the <i>halakha</i> here, in the case of a betrothed young woman who is the daughter of a priest, is <b>like there. Just as there,</b> with regard to a betrothed young woman who is not the daughter of a priest, <b>the verse speaks of</b> her <b>first intercourse, here too, the verse speaks of</b> her <b>first intercourse.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said to</b> Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: My <b>Master does not say,</b> i.e., does not explain the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>like that.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And who is</b> his Master? <b>Rav Yosef.</b>",
    "Rather, he explains the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi as follows: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says:</b> In the case of the daughter of a priest who <b>married one of the</b> men <b>unfit</b> for her, e.g., a <i>mamzer</i>, and committed adultery while married to him, <b>her death</b> sentence is administered <b>by strangulation</b> and not by burning.",
    "<b>And this</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying: If she first profanes herself,</b> i.e., disqualifies herself from the priesthood, <b>by</b> committing <b>adultery,</b> she is executed <b>by burning, but</b> in <b>another</b> case, where she was already disqualified from the priesthood by marrying a man unfit for her, she is executed <b>by strangulation. And what</b> is the meaning of the end of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement: <b>And likewise</b> it says: “Then the man who lay with her alone shall die”?"
