    "The Gemara answers: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that only the <b>married</b> daughter of a priest who committed adultery <b>is singled out</b> from all those who commit adultery, <b>for burning, but not</b> one who is <b>betrothed,</b> as a betrothed woman who committed adultery, whether or not she is the daughter of a priest, is executed by stoning. <b>And since the Merciful One singles out a betrothed woman</b> who is not married from all married women who commit adultery, to be executed <b>by stoning, conclude from it</b> that <b>stoning</b> is more <b>severe</b> than burning.",
    "<b>Stoning</b> is considered more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword, as it is meted out to one who blasphemes and to one who worships idols. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of these transgressions considered greater than others? <b>As we said,</b> it is because the transgressors undermine the fundamental tenets of Judaism.",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary;</b> decapitation by the <b>sword</b> would appear to be more <b>severe</b> than stoning, <b>as it is meted out to the people of an idolatrous city,</b> who also undermine the fundamental tenets of Judaism. <b>And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this case of an idolatrous city considered greater than others? <b>Because</b> the transgressors are not only executed, <b>their property is destroyed</b> as well.",
    "The Gemara answers: In response to this objection, <b>you</b> should <b>say: The severity of which</b> transgression <b>is greater: The severity</b> of the transgression <b>of the one who subverts</b> the city, inciting them to sin, <b>or the severity</b> of the transgression <b>of the subverted? You must say</b> that <b>the severity of</b> the transgression of <b>the subverter</b> is greater. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The subverters of an idolatrous city</b> are executed <b>by stoning.</b> Evidently, stoning is a more severe type of execution than decapitation.",
    "<b>Stoning</b> is considered more <b>severe than strangulation, as it is meted out to one who blasphemes and to one who worships idols. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of these transgressions considered greater? <b>As we said,</b> it is because the transgressors undermine the fundamental tenets of Judaism.",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary; strangulation</b> is more <b>severe, as it is meted out to one who wounds his father or his mother. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater? <b>Because the honor of</b> one’s parents <b>is compared to the honor of the Omnipresent</b> (see <i>Kiddushin</i> 30b).",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Since the Merciful One singles out</b> the case of <b>a betrothed Jewish woman from the category of a married Jewish woman,</b> changing the punishment of a betrothed Jewish woman who committed adultery <b>from strangulation to stoning, conclude from it</b> that <b>stoning</b> is more <b>severe.</b>",
    "<b>Burning</b> is considered more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword, as it is meted out to a priest’s daughter who committed adultery. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater than others? <b>Because she profanes</b> both herself and <b>her father.</b>",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary;</b> decapitation by the <b>sword</b> is more <b>severe, as it is meted out to the people of an idolatrous city. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this case considered greater? <b>Because</b> the transgressors are not only executed, <b>their property is destroyed</b> as well.",
    "The Gemara answers: The severity of burning is derived by means of a verbal analogy. The term <b>“her father” is stated with regard to stoning,</b> in the verse: “And the men of her city shall stone her with stones and she shall die, because she has done a depraved thing in Israel, to play the harlot in the house of her father” (Deuteronomy 22:21), <b>and</b> the term <b>“her father” is stated with regard to burning,</b> in the verse: “And the daughter of a priest, when she profanes herself by playing the harlot, she profanes her father; she shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 21:9). Therefore, <b>just as</b> concerning the term <b>“her father” that is stated with regard to stoning</b> it is established that <b>stoning</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword, so too,</b> concerning the term <b>“her father” that is stated with regard to burning,</b> it may be established that <b>burning</b> is more <b>severe than</b> decapitation by the <b>sword.</b>",
    "<b>Burning</b> is considered more <b>severe than strangulation, as it is meted out to a priest’s daughter who committed adultery. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater? <b>As we said,</b> because she profanes both herself and her father.",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: <b>On the contrary; strangulation</b> is more <b>severe, as it is meted out to one who wounds his father or his mother. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater? <b>Because the honor of</b> one’s parents <b>is compared to the honor of the Omnipresent.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Since the Merciful One singles out</b> the case of <b>the married daughter of a priest from the category of a married Jewish woman,</b> changing the punishment of the married daughter of a priest who committed adultery <b>from strangulation to burning, conclude from it</b> that <b>burning</b> is more <b>severe</b> than strangulation.",

    "The Gemara answers: <b>Nevertheless,</b> the transgression of <b>one who undermines the fundamental</b> tenets of Judaism is <b>more</b> severe, as he defiles the honor of the Omnipresent Himself, so his punishment must certainly be the most severe.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the order of severity is burning, stoning, strangulation, and killing. The Gemara explains the basis for his opinion. <b>Burning</b> is considered more <b>severe than stoning, as</b> burning <b>is meted out to a priest’s daughter who committed adultery. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater than the others? <b>Because she profanes</b> both herself and <b>her father.</b>",

    "The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> that the daughter of a priest, <b>whether</b> she is <b>betrothed or married, is singled out for burning. And since the Merciful One singles out</b> the case of <b>the betrothed daughter of a priest from the category of a betrothed Jewish woman,</b> changing her punishment <b>from</b> execution by <b>stoning to</b> execution by <b>burning, conclude from it</b> that <b>burning</b> is more <b>severe</b> than stoning, as the punishment for a priest’s daughter who committed adultery must certainly be more severe than that of the daughter of a non-priest.",
    "The Gemara continues to explain the order of severity according to Rabbi Shimon. <b>Burning</b> is considered more <b>severe than strangulation, as it is meted out to a priest’s daughter who committed adultery. And</b> for <b>what</b> reason is the <b>severity</b> of this transgression considered greater? <b>As we said,</b> it is because she profanes both herself and her father.",
