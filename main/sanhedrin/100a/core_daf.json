    "<b>have they permitted a raven for us nor have they prohibited a dove for us.</b> They merely tell us matters stated explicitly in the Torah.",
    "The Gemara relates with regard to <b>Rava: When they would bring</b> a possible <b><i>tereifa</i> from the house of Binyamin before him, when he would see in it a reason to permit</b> its consumption, Rava would <b>say to them: See that I am permitting a raven for you,</b> as this is an animal that appeared forbidden. <b>When he would see in it a reason to prohibit</b> its consumption, Rava would <b>say to them: See that I am prohibiting a dove for you.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The <i>epikoros</i> mentioned in the mishna is referring to one who conducts himself <b>like one who says: Those Sages,</b> with contemptuous overtones. The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa</b> himself <b>forgot</b> in one instance <b>and said: Like those Sages, and he observed a fast</b> to achieve atonement for expressing himself in that manner.",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>Levi bar Shmuel and Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya were mending mantles for</b> the sacred <b>scrolls of the school of Rav Yehuda. When they reached the scroll of Esther they said: This scroll of Esther does not require a mantle,</b> as it is not as significant as the other sacred scrolls. Rav Yehuda <b>said to them:</b> A statement <b>of that sort also seems</b> to express irreverence <b>like</b> the <b>irreverence</b> typical of an <i>epikoros</i>, as you should not have referred to the scroll of Esther as: This scroll.",
    "<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> An <i>epikoros</i> <b>is one who calls his teacher by his name</b> and does not call him Rabbi, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: For what</b> reason <b>was Gehazi punished?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he called his teacher by his name, as it is stated: “And Gehazi said: My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha revived”</b> (II Kings 8:5).",
    "§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yirmeya sat before Rabbi Zeira, and sat and said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, will cause a river to emerge from the Holy of Holies, and alongside it all sorts of delicacies</b> will grow, <b>as it is stated: “And the river upon its bank, on this side and on that side shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither, neither shall its fruit fall; it shall bring forth new fruit every month, because their waters emerged from the Sanctuary; and its fruit shall be for food and its leaf for medicine”</b> (Ezekiel 47:12). <b>A certain elder said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Well done, and so Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Well done. Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> Does a statement <b>of that sort,</b> when one who is not a Torah scholar says to a Sage that his statement is correct, <b>seem like</b> the <b>irreverence</b> typical of an <i>epikoros</i>?",
    "Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: But isn’t he supporting your</b> statement? He meant no disrespect. <b>Rather, if you heard</b> that at times supporting the statement of a Sage is irreverent, <b>this</b> is what <b>you heard:</b> It is <b>like that</b> case in <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan sat and taught: The Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to bring precious stones and jewels that are thirty by thirty cubits, and He will bore in them</b> an opening <b>ten</b> cubits wide <b>by twenty</b> cubits <b>in height and place them</b> to serve <b>as the gates of Jerusalem, as it is stated: “And I will make your pinnacles of rubies and your gates of carbuncles”</b> (Isaiah 54:12). <b>A certain student mocked him</b> and <b>said: Now,</b> at present, <b>we do not find</b> precious stones <b>comparable</b> in size to <b>the egg of a palm dove.</b> Will <b>we find</b> stones <b>as large as</b> those <b>that</b> you described?",
    "<b>Sometime</b> later that student’s <b>ship set sail at sea. He saw the ministering angels cutting precious stones</b> that size. <b>He said to</b> the angels: <b>For whom</b> are <b>these</b> stones? The angels <b>said</b> to him: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, is destined to place them at the gates of Jerusalem. When</b> the student <b>returned, he found Rabbi Yoḥanan, who was sitting and teaching.</b> The student <b>said to him: My teacher, teach, and it is fitting for you to teach. Just as you said</b> with regard to the precious stones, <b>so I saw.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Good-for-nothing, if you did not see</b> it, <b>you would not believe</b> it? <b>You</b> are one who <b>mocks the statements of the Sages.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>directed his eyes toward him</b> in anger <b>and rendered him a pile of bones.</b>",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan that the gates will be twenty cubits high. The Sages engaged in a dispute concerning the interpretation of the verse: <b>“And I made you go upright [<i>komemiyyut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:13). <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that in the end of days people will be <b>two hundred cubits</b> tall, <b>the equivalent of twice the height of Adam the first</b> man, who was one hundred cubits tall. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> People will be <b>one hundred cubits</b> tall, <b>corresponding to</b> the height of the <b>Sanctuary and its walls, as it is stated: “For our sons are as plants grown up in their youth; our daughters as cornerstones, carved in the fashion of a palace”</b> (Psalms 144:12), indicating that the sons and daughters will be one hundred cubits tall, the height of the Sanctuary. If the people are that tall, how will they enter gates twenty cubits high?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the openings would be twenty cubits high he is referring <b>to the windows</b> through which <b>wind enters.</b> The gates through which people enter will extend considerably higher.",
    "§ Apropos the river that will emerge from the Holy of Holies, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>And its leaf for medicine [<i>literufa</i>]? Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avudimi and Rav Ḥisda</b> disagree. <b>One says:</b> This is an abbreviation for the phrase: <b>To unlock the mouth [<i>lehattir peh</i>]</b> that is <b>above,</b> i.e., the leaf heals the mute. <b>And one says:</b> That is the abbreviation, but it means <b>to unlock the mouth</b> that is <b>below,</b> a euphemism for healing the womb of a barren woman.",
    "<b>It was also stated</b> that other Sages engaged in a dispute concerning this matter. <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> that the reference is: <b>To unlock the mouth of mutes,</b> and <b>bar Kappara says</b> that the reference is: <b>To unlock the mouth of barren women. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The reference is <b>to actual medicine.</b> The Gemara asks: According to that opinion, <b>what is</b> the meaning of the term: <b>For medicine [<i>literufa</i>]? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> It is an abbreviation meaning <b>to</b> beautify <b>the countenance [<i>letoar panim</i>] of the keepers of the mouth [<i>peh</i>],</b> i.e., the Sages, who labored with their mouths to study Torah in this world.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Simon, taught:</b> For <b>anyone who blackens his face</b> while toiling <b>over matters of Torah in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, shines his brightness in the World-to-Come, as it is stated:</b> “His locks are curly black as a raven” (Song of Songs 5:11), and thereafter it is written: <b>“His countenance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars”</b> (Song of Songs 5:15), followed by: “His palate is like sweets” (Song of Songs 5:16). One who engages in sweets, i.e., Torah study, in this world, until he is blackened, black as a raven, is privileged to shining brightness in the World-to-Come.",
    "<b>Rabbi Tanḥum, son of Rabbi Ḥanilai, says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who starves himself over matters of Torah in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, satisfies him in the World-to-Come, as it is stated:</b> “Your judgments are like the great deep” (Psalms 36:7), indicating that God is exacting with the righteous and does not reward them in this world, and it is stated thereafter: <b>“They are abundantly satisfied with the plenty of Your house, and You feed them drink of the river of Your pleasures”</b> (Psalms 36:9).",
    "<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: The Holy One, Blessed be He, will give each and every righteous person His handful, as it is stated: “Blessed be the Lord, Who day by day bears our burden; God is our salvation, Selah”</b> (Psalms 68:20). <b>Abaye said to him: And is it possible to say so,</b> that the Holy One, Blessed be He, will give them His handful? <b>But wasn’t it already stated: “Who has measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out heaven with the span,</b> and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure” (Isaiah 40:12)? And if the span of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is as great as the heavens, how can a person receive a handful from the Holy One, Blessed be He?",
    "Rav Dimi <b>said: What is the reason</b> that <b>you are not familiar with</b> matters of <b><i>aggada</i>? As they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rava bar Mari: The Holy One, Blessed be He, will give every righteous person 310 worlds as it is stated: “To bequeath to those who love Me substance [<i>yesh</i>]; and I will fill their treasuries”</b> (Proverbs 8:21). <b>In</b> terms of its <b>numerical value,</b> the word <b><i>yesh</i>,</b> spelled <i>yod</i>, <i>shin</i>, <b>is 310,</b> indicating that God grants the righteous a full measure.",
    "In a related matter, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: In accordance with the measure that a person metes</b> out for others the heavenly court <b>metes</b> out <b>for him,</b> i.e., the response is commensurate with the action, <b>as it is written: “In full measure [<i>besasse’a</i>] when You send her away do You contend with her”</b> (Isaiah 27:8). The term <i>besasse’a</i> is interpreted as <i>bese’a se’a</i>, meaning that one receives a measure [<i>se’a</i>] commensurate with the measure [<i>bese’a</i>] that he meted out.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said</b> to Rabbi Meir: <b>And is it possible to say that</b> if <b>a person gives his handful to a pauper in this world, the Holy One, Blessed be He, gives him His handful in the World-to-Come? But isn’t it written: “And meted out heaven with the span”</b> (Isaiah 40:12)? He asked how one can receive so bountiful a reward. Rabbi Meir answered him: <b>And you do not say so? Which</b> of God’s <b>attributes is greater?</b> Is <b>the attribute of reward greater or</b> is <b>the attribute of punishment</b> greater?"
