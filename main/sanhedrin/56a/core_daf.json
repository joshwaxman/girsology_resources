    "<b>On every day</b> of a blasphemer’s trial, when the judges <b>judge the witnesses,</b> i.e., interrogate the witnesses, they ask the witnesses to use <b>an appellation</b> for the name of God, so that they do not utter a curse of God’s name. Specifically, the witnesses would say: <b>Let Yosei smite Yosei,</b> as the name Yosei has four letters in Hebrew, as does the Tetragrammaton.",
    "When <b>the judgment is over,</b> and the court votes to deem the defendant guilty, <b>they do not sentence</b> him <b>to death based on</b> the testimony of the witnesses in which they used <b>an appellation</b> for the name of God, without having ever heard the exact wording of the curse. <b>Rather, they remove all</b> the <b>people</b> who are not required to be there from the court, so that the curse is not heard publicly, and the judges <b>interrogate the eldest of</b> the witnesses, <b>and say to him: Say what you heard explicitly. And he says</b> exactly what he heard. <b>And the judges stand on their feet and make a tear</b> in their garments, as an act of mourning for the desecration of the honor of God. <b>And they do not</b> ever fully <b>stitch</b> it back together again.",
    "<b>And the second</b> witness <b>says: I too</b> heard <b>as he</b> did, but he does not repeat the curse explicitly. <b>And the third</b> witness, in the event that there is one, <b>says: I too</b> heard <b>as he</b> did. In this manner, the repetition of the invective sentence is limited to what is absolutely necessary.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A blasphemer is not liable <b>unless he blesses,</b> a euphemism for curses, the <b>name</b> of God <b>with</b> the <b>name</b> of God, e.g., by saying: Let such and such a name strike such and such a name.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is derived from that <b>which the verse states: “And he who blasphemes [<i>venokev</i>] the name</b> of the Lord shall be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him; the convert as well as the homeborn, <b>when he blasphemes [<i>benokvo</i>] the name, he shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16). It is derived from the repetition of the phrase “blasphemes the name” that the reference is to cursing the name of God with the name of God.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that this</b> word <b><i>nokev</i> is a term for blessing,</b> i.e., cursing? The Gemara answers that it is derived from the statement of Balaam, who was sent by Balak to curse the Jewish people: <b>“How shall I curse [<i>ekkov</i>] whom God has not cursed?”</b> (Numbers 23:8). <b>And</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against cursing God is derived <b>from here: “You shall not curse God”</b> (Exodus 22:27).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> that perhaps the meaning of <i>nokev</i> <b>is</b> not cursing, but rather <b>making a hole, as it is written: “And made a hole [<i>vayyikkov</i>] in its lid”</b> (II Kings 12:10). According to this, the word <i>nokev</i> is referring to one who makes a hole and damages the written name of God. <b>And</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against doing so is derived <b>from here: “And you shall destroy their name</b> out of that place. <b>You shall not do so to the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:3–4).",
    "The Gemara answers: It is derived from the repetition of <i>nokev</i> that for one to be liable, it is <b>necessary</b> that his transgression involve the <b>name</b> of God <b>with</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>and</b> such a transgression is <b>not</b> possible if the reference is to making a hole.",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>But say that</b> such a transgression is possible, as one can <b>place two</b> written <b>names</b> of God, <b>one on top of the other, and tear</b> through <b>them</b> at once. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> would be defined as <b>making a hole and again making a hole,</b> not making a hole in one name by means of another name. The Gemara asks: <b>But say that</b> one can <b>etch</b> the <b>name</b> of God <b>on the point of a knife and cut</b> through another name <b>with it.</b> The Gemara answers: In <b>that</b> case, <b>it is the point of the knife that is cutting,</b> not the name of God.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Say</b> that <i>nokev</i> means the <b>utterance of the</b> ineffable <b>name of</b> God. <b>As it is written: “And Moses and Aaron took these men that are pointed out [<i>nikkevu</i>] by name”</b> (Numbers 1:17). <b>And</b> the <b>prohibition</b> to do so is derived <b>from here: “You shall fear the Lord, your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13).",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> answer is <b>that</b> for one to be liable, it is <b>necessary</b> that his transgression involve the <b>name</b> of God <b>with</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>and</b> such a transgression is <b>not</b> possible if the reference is to uttering the ineffable name of God. <b>Furthermore,</b> the prohibition derived from the verse “You shall fear the Lord, your God” <b>is a prohibition</b> stated as <b>a positive mitzva, and a prohibition</b> stated as <b>a positive mitzva is not considered a prohibition.</b>",
    "The Gemara presents an alternative proof that <i>nokev</i> is referring to cursing: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>the verse states: “And</b> the son of the Israelite woman <b>blasphemed [<i>vayyikkov</i>]</b> the name <b>and cursed”</b> (Leviticus 24:11). <b>That is to say that</b> the meaning of <b><i>nokev</i> is</b> to <b>curse.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> this verse does not prove that the meaning of <i>nokev</i> is to curse; rather, it indicates that one is not liable to be executed <b>unless he does both,</b> i.e., both <i>nokev</i> and cursing God? The Gemara answers: This shall <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Bring forth the one who cursed…</b>and stone him” (Leviticus 24:14), <b>and it is not written: Bring forth the <i>nokev</i> and one who cursed. Conclude from it</b> that <b>it is one</b> act and not two.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin” (Leviticus 24:15), that the verse could have stated: <b>One [<i>ish</i>]</b> who curses his God. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Anyone [<i>ish ish</i>]”?</b> It is <b>to include the gentiles, who are prohibited from blessing,</b> i.e., cursing, <b>the name</b> of God, just <b>like Jews</b> are. <b>And they are executed</b> for this transgression <b>by the sword alone, as all death</b> penalties <b>stated with regard to the descendants of Noah are by the sword alone.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But is this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from here?</b> Rather, <b>it is derived from there:</b> “And the Lord God commanded the man” (Genesis 2:16), as is stated in a <i>baraita</i> that will soon be quoted at length: <b>“The Lord,” this</b> is referring to <b>the blessing,</b> i.e., cursing, <b>of the name</b> of God. This verse concerns Adam, the first man, and is therefore binding on all of humanity.",
    "<b>Rav Yitzḥak Nappaḥa says:</b> The verse “anyone who curses his God” <b>is necessary only to include</b> gentiles who curse God using <b>the appellations</b> for the name of God, rather than mentioning the ineffable name, <b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin”? But isn’t it already stated: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16)? Rather, <b>since it is stated: “And he who blasphemes the name</b> of the Lord <b>shall be put to death,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that one <b>will be liable only for</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the verse <b>includes</b> one who curses <b>any of the appellations</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “Anyone who curses his God,”</b> to indicate that one is liable to be executed <b>in any case.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>",
    "<b>And the Rabbis say: For</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God, one is punished <b>by death, and for</b> cursing <b>the appellations,</b> one is liable to receive lashes <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rav Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, who holds that according to the Rabbis, gentiles are not liable for cursing appellations for the name of God, <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Meyasha. As Rav Meyasha says: A descendant of Noah who blessed God by</b> one of the <b>appellations is liable</b> to be executed even <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>",
    "<b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because the verse states: “The convert as well as the homeborn,</b> when he blasphemes the name, he shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:16), from which it is derived that <b>it is</b> only in the case of <b>a convert or a homeborn</b> Jew <b>that we require</b> the condition: <b>“When he blasphemes the name,”</b> i.e., he is liable to be executed only if he curses the ineffable name. <b>But a gentile</b> is liable to be executed <b>even due to</b> merely cursing <b>an appellation.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rabbi Meir do with this</b> part of the verse: <b>“The convert as well as the homeborn”?</b> What does he derive from it? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Meir derives that <b>a convert or a homeborn</b> Jew is liable to be executed <b>by stoning</b> for this transgression, <b>but a gentile</b> is executed <b>by the sword.</b> This exclusion is necessary as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> gentiles <b>are included</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of this verse, <b>they are included</b> in all the <i>halakhot</i> of blasphemy. Therefore the verse <b>teaches us</b> that they are not stoned.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what does Rav Yitzḥak Nappaḥa do with this</b> part of the verse: <b>“The convert as well as the homeborn,” according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> since Rav Yitzḥak Nappaḥa holds that the Rabbis do not deem either a Jew or a gentile liable for cursing an appellation of God’s name? The Gemara answers: He derives that <b>it is</b> specifically with regard to <b>a convert and a homeborn</b> Jew <b>that we require</b> the condition that he curse <b>a name</b> of God <b>by a name</b> of God; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>a gentile, we do not require</b> that he curse <b>a name</b> of God <b>by a name</b> of God in order for him to be liable.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the inclusive term <b>“anyone</b> who curses his God,” according to the opinions that do not derive from it that a gentile is liable for cursing an appellation of God’s name? The Gemara answers: No <i>halakha</i> is derived from it; it is not a superfluous term, as <b>the Torah spoke in the language of people.</b>",
    "§ Since the <i>halakhot</i> of the descendants of Noah have been mentioned, a full discussion of the Noahide mitzvot is presented. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., all of humanity, <b>were commanded</b> to observe <b>seven mitzvot:</b> The mitzva of establishing courts of <b>judgment; and</b> the prohibition against <b>blessing,</b> i.e., cursing, <b>the name</b> of God; and the prohibition of <b>idol worship;</b> and the prohibition against <b>forbidden sexual relations; and</b> the prohibition of <b>bloodshed; and</b> the prohibition of <b>robbery; and</b> the prohibition against eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal."
