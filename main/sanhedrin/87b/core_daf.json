    "for example, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of the prohibition against engaging in intercourse with <b>one’s daughter</b> born <b>from</b> the <b>victim of his rape.</b>",
    "<b>As Rava says: Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to me:</b> This prohibition is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the word <b><i>henna</i>,</b> in the verse: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter, even their nakedness you shall not uncover; for theirs [<i>henna</i>] is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), and the word <b><i>henna</i></b> in a different verse: “You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: They [<i>henna</i>] are near kinswomen; it is lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17). This verbal analogy indicates that just as intercourse with one’s granddaughter and with one’s wife’s daughter or granddaughter is forbidden, so too, intercourse with one’s daughter is prohibited.",
    "Furthermore, it is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the word <b>“lewdness”</b> (Leviticus 18:17) and the word <b>“lewdness”</b> in the verse: “And if a man take with his wife also her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire, both he and they, so that there be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14), that one who engages in sexual intercourse with his daughter or granddaughter is liable to be executed by burning.",
    "<b>“Between blood and blood”;</b> this is the ability to discern <b>between</b> the disparate <i>halakhot</i> relevant to the <b>blood of menstruation,</b> the <b>blood of childbirth,</b> and the <b>blood of</b> a gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>ziva</i>].</b> In each of these cases, there is a dispute between the Sages with regard to a matter for whose intentional violation one is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. In the case of the <b>blood of menstruation,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Akavya ben Mahalalel and the Rabbis, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 19a): With regard to <b>blood that is green</b> that is discharged by a woman, <b>Akavya ben Mahalalel deems</b> it blood of menstruation and <b>impure, and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>pure.</b> According to Akavya ben Mahalalel, one who engages in intercourse with a woman who discharged green blood is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, while according to the Rabbis, he is exempt.",
    "In the case of the <b>blood of childbirth,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rav and Levi.</b> This is <b>as it was stated</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Blood that a woman discharges after childbirth <b>is</b> all from <b>one source; the Torah deemed ritually impure</b> the blood discharged for one week after the birth of a male and two weeks after the birth of a female, <b>and the Torah deemed</b> ritually pure the blood that is discharged for the subsequent thirty-three days for a male and sixty-six days for a female. Even if the blood flows continuously, the status of the blood changes after the conclusion of the period of impurity.",
    "<b>And Levi says: It is</b> from <b>two sources; the impure</b> source <b>is sealed</b> after one week for a male and two weeks for a female, and then <b>the pure</b> source <b>is opened,</b> and at the conclusion of the period of the discharge of pure blood, <b>the pure</b> source <b>is sealed</b> and <b>the impure</b> source <b>is opened.</b> Only if the flow of impure blood ceases is a subsequent discharge deemed pure. Therefore, if one engaged in intercourse with a woman who experienced a continuous flow of blood beyond the time of the conclusion of the period of the flow of pure blood, according to Levi, he is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, and according to Rav, he is exempt.",
    "In the case of the <b>blood of <i>ziva</i>,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 36b): In a case where a woman <b>experienced labor</b> pain accompanied by an emission of blood lasting <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days within</b> the <b>eleven days</b> between the periods when her emissions render her a menstruating woman, during which the emission of blood renders the woman a <i>zava</i>, <b>if she ceased</b> experiencing labor <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period,</b> indicating that the blood was not the result of imminent birth, <b>and</b> then <b>she gave birth, that</b> woman <b>gives birth as a <i>zava</i></b> and is liable to bring the purification offerings of both a woman after childbirth and a <i>zava</i>; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>",
    "The mishna continues: <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> That is her status only if she ceased experiencing labor for a twenty-four-hour period that is <b>a night and</b> the <b>day</b> that follows, <b>like Shabbat evening and</b> the <b>day</b> that follows <b>it.</b> When the mishna says that she ceased, it is referring to a case <b>where she ceased from</b> having labor <b>pains and not from</b> having <b>the</b> flow of <b>blood.</b> The dispute is whether the woman who gave birth has the status of a <i>zava</i>, who is required to count seven clean days before immersing in flowing water, or whether she has the status of a woman after childbirth. If the two weeks of the blood of impurity after childbirth elapsed and she did not immerse in flowing water, according to Rabbi Eliezer, she remains a <i>zava</i>, and one who engages in intercourse with her is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. According to Rabbi Yehoshua, at that point the blood becomes the blood of purity, and one who engages in intercourse with her is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>.",
    "<b>“Between plea and plea”;</b> this is the ability to discern <b>between</b> cases of <b>capital law,</b> cases of <b>monetary law,</b> and cases of <b>laws</b> involving <b>lashes.</b> The Gemara elaborates: In cases of <b>monetary law,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Shmuel and Rabbi Abbahu, as Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>two</b> judges <b>who sat in judgment</b> and issued a ruling in cases of monetary law, <b>their ruling is</b> a valid <b>ruling, but they are characterized as an impudent court. And Rabbi Abbahu says: Everyone agrees</b> that <b>their ruling is not</b> a valid <b>ruling.</b> If a tribunal of two judges rules that one of the litigants must pay the other money, and that litigant uses the money to betroth a woman, according to Shmuel she is betrothed, and one who intentionally engages in intercourse with her is liable to receive <i>karet</i>. According to Rabbi Abbahu she is not betrothed, and one who engages in intercourse with her is not liable.",
    "In cases of <b>capital law,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> with regard to that which is written: “If men struggle and they hurt a pregnant woman…and if there shall be a tragedy <b>you shall give a life for a life”</b> (Exodus 21:22–23), the reference is to <b>a monetary payment</b> for the life that he took. The tragedy referenced is the unintentional killing of the mother.",
    "The <i>tanna</i> deliberates: <b>Do you say</b> that the reference is to <b>a monetary payment, or</b> perhaps the reference is <b>only</b> to giving his <b>actual life?</b> Based on the language employed in the verse, it can be determined that the reference is to monetary payment. In these verses, <b>giving is stated above:</b> “And you shall give a life for a life,” <b>and giving is stated below:</b> “He shall be punished, as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him, and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:23). <b>Just as there,</b> in the phrase “Give as the judges determine,” the reference is to <b>monetary payment, so too here,</b> in the phrase “Give a life for a life,” the reference is to <b>monetary payment.</b> The Rabbis hold that the reference is to giving his actual life. If an heir of the victim betrothed a woman with money seized from the assailant, according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi the woman is betrothed, while according to the Rabbis she is not betrothed.",
    "In cases of <b>laws</b> involving <b>lashes,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yishmael and the Rabbis, as we learned</b> in a mishna (2a): Cases concerning the violation of prohibitions that render one liable to receive <b>lashes</b> are adjudicated <b>by three</b> judges. The Sages <b>stated in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> Cases concerning lashes are adjudicated <b>by twenty-three</b> judges. According to Rabbi Yishmael, if a tribunal of three sentences an individual to lashes, that individual can claim damages for any injury caused as a result of the lashes, and if he betroths a woman with that money the betrothal is valid. According to the Rabbis, he cannot claim damages, as the court is authorized to sentence him to receive lashes.",
    "<b>“Between mark and mark”;</b> this is the ability to discern <b>between</b> the disparate <i>halakhot</i> relevant to leprous <b>marks of a person,</b> leprous <b>marks on houses,</b> and leprous <b>marks on garments.</b>",
    "In the case of leprous <b>marks of a person,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehoshua and the Rabbis, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 4:11): <b>If the snow-white</b> leprous <b>mark [<i>baheret</i>] preceded the white hair,</b> the individual is <b>impure</b> with leprosy, as that is the order of events that appears in the Torah, and <b>if the white hair preceded the <i>baheret</i>,</b> the individual is <b>pure.</b> If there is <b>uncertainty</b> concerning which appeared first, the Rabbis say: He is <b>impure,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It has <b>darkened.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: It has <b>darkened? Rava says:</b> Its status is like that of a <i>baheret</i> that <b>darkened,</b> with regard to which the Torah says that he is <b>pure.</b> If one with a <i>baheret</i> and a white hair entered the Temple, and there is uncertainty concerning which appeared first, according to the Rabbis he is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, and according to Rabbi Yehoshua he is not liable.",
    "In the case of leprous <b>marks of houses,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and the Rabbis, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 12:3): <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: A house is never</b> deemed <b>impure</b> with leprosy <b>unless</b> the leprous mark <b>will be seen</b> to be the size of <b>two Cilician beans, on two stones, on two walls, in a corner</b> between two walls. <b>The length of</b> the mark <b>is</b> that of <b>two Cilician beans and its width is</b> that of one <b>Cilician bean.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: The word <b>wall is written</b> in the verse <b>and</b> the word <b>walls is written</b> in the same verse: And he shall see the leprous mark…in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and their appearance is lower than the wall” (Leviticus 14:37). <b>Which is</b> one <b>wall that is like</b> multiple <b>walls? You must say: This is a corner</b> between two walls. The Rabbis hold that it is a leprous house even if the mark appears on one wall. Therefore, one who entered a house with a leprous mark on one wall and then entered the Temple is liable to receive <i>karet</i> according to the Rabbis; according to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, he is not liable.",
    "In the case of leprous <b>marks on garments,</b> the dispute concerning such a prohibition is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos and the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos says: From where</b> is it derived"
