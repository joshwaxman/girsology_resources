    "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the mitzva of <b>circumcision, which was stated with regard to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., Abraham and his descendants, who had the status of descendants of Noah at that time? <b>As it is written</b> that God said to Abraham with regard to the mitzva of circumcision: <b>“And as for you, you shall keep My covenant,</b> you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations” (Genesis 17:9). <b>And it was repeated at Sinai</b> for the Jewish people: <b>“And on the eighth day</b> the flesh of his foreskin <b>shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:3), and nevertheless <b>it was stated for the Jewish people</b> alone <b>and not for the descendants of Noah.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse stated at Sinai is not necessary for the mitzva itself, but rather <b>it comes to permit</b> circumcision on <b>Shabbat.</b> It is derived from the phrase <b>“on the</b> eighth <b>day”</b> that circumcision must always be performed on the eight day, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if it falls <b>on Shabbat.</b> Therefore the mitzva is not considered to have been repeated at Mount Sinai.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the mitzva of <b>procreation, which was stated with regard to the descendants of Noah? As it is written: “And you, be fruitful and multiply,</b> swarm in the land and multiply in it” (Genesis 9:7). <b>And it was repeated at Sinai,</b> in the verse: <b>“Go say to them: Return to your tents”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27), when the Jewish men were commanded to resume conjugal relations with their wives after having been commanded to separate from them in preparation for the giving of the Torah. Nevertheless, the mitzva of procreation <b>was stated for the Jewish people and not for the descendants of Noah.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse stated at Sinai is not necessary for the mitzva itself, but rather <b>it comes to</b> teach another <i>halakha</i>: <b>That any matter that</b> was prohibited <b>by</b> an official <b>vote</b> of the Sanhedrin <b>requires another vote to permit it.</b> Even if a rabbinic prohibition is no longer relevant, it is not automatically canceled, but rather a special ruling is required to cancel it. This is derived from the fact that it was necessary for God to issue a declaration (Deuteronomy 5:26) specifically canceling the prohibition that had been issued before the giving of the Torah.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let us say</b> with regard to <b>each and every one</b> of the seven Noahide mitzvot that <b>it was repeated because of</b> an additional <b>matter</b> the Torah teaches, and the descendants of Noah are exempt from them all.",
    "The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>is saying:</b> After stating <b>a prohibition</b> with regard to the descendants of Noah, <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to <b>then repeat</b> the prohibition itself for the Jewish people? If the only purpose is to teach an additional <i>halakha</i>, it is unnecessary to repeat it in the form of a prohibition, e.g., “You shall not murder…you shall not commit adultery” (Exodus 20:13). Therefore, it is derived from the fact that the entire prohibition is repeated, and not just the new details, that it applies both to Jews and to descendants of Noah.",
    "It is stated in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And we have only</b> the prohibition against eating <b>the sciatic nerve</b> to which this classification applies, <b>and</b> this is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: But <b>these</b> aforementioned mitzvot <b>also,</b> procreation and circumcision, <b>were not repeated</b> at Sinai in order to teach that they apply to the descendants of Noah as well as to the Jewish people, but rather were mentioned for other purposes, and therefore, they apply only to the Jewish people, similar to the prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>These</b> mitzvot <b>were repeated for the sake of</b> teaching <b>some</b> other <b>matter.</b> By contrast, <b>this</b> prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>was not repeated at all;</b> it is mentioned only in Genesis. Therefore, circumcision and procreation are not included in the category of mitzvot that were given to the descendants of Noah and were not repeated at Sinai.",
    "<b>If you wish, say</b> that there is another explanation for the fact that the mitzva of <b>circumcision</b> does not apply to the descendants of Noah despite the fact that it was repeated for the Jewish people: <b>From the outset, it was Abraham,</b> and not all the descendants of Noah, <b>that the Merciful One commanded to</b> perform this mitzva; as He said to him: <b>“And as for you, you shall keep My covenant, you and your offspring after you, throughout their generations”</b> (Genesis 17:9). The Gemara infers: <b>“You and your offspring,” yes; another person, no.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so, the descendants of Ishmael should</b> also <b>be obligated</b> to observe circumcision, as they are also the offspring of Abraham. The Gemara explains: The verse states: <b>“For through Isaac, offspring shall be called yours”</b> (Genesis 21:12), which means that Ishmael’s descendants are not called the offspring of Abraham.",
    "The Gemara challenges: Granted, Ishmael’s descendants are not considered the offspring of Abraham, but at least <b>the descendants of Esau,</b> Isaac’s son, <b>should be obligated</b> to observe circumcision. The Gemara explains: Since the term: <b>“Through Isaac [<i>beYitzḥak</i>],”</b> also means: Of Isaac, it is derived that the mitzva applies to only some of Isaac’s offspring, <b>but not all</b> the descendants of <b>Isaac.</b> This serves to exclude the descendants of Esau.",
    "<b>Rav Oshaya objects to this: If that is so, the descendants of Keturah,</b> Abraham’s second wife, <b>should not be obligated</b> to observe circumcision. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says, and some say</b> that it is <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> who says that the verse: “And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; <b>he has broken My covenant”</b> (Genesis 17:14) is stated <b>to include the descendants of Keturah</b> in the obligation to observe circumcision.",
    "§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Meat was not permitted to Adam, the first</b> man, <b>for consumption, as it is written:</b> “And God said: Behold, I have given you every herb that brings forth seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree that gives forth seed; <b>for you it shall be for food, and for every animal of the earth,</b> and for every fowl of the air, and for everything that creeps upon the earth, in which there is a living soul, every green herb for food. And it was so” (Genesis 1:29–30). It is derived God told Adam: Eating vegetation is permitted to people and animals, <b>but</b> eating <b>the animals of the earth is not</b> permitted <b>to you.</b>",
    "<b>But when the children of Noah came,</b> God <b>permitted them</b> to eat meat; <b>as it is stated:</b> “Every moving thing that lives shall be for food for you; <b>as the green herb I have given you all”</b> (Genesis 9:3). One <b>might</b> have thought that accordingly, even the prohibition against eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>does not apply to</b> the descendants of Noah; therefore <b>the verse states: “Only flesh with its life, which is its blood, you shall not eat”</b> (Genesis 9:4). One <b>might</b> have thought that the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal applies <b>even to creeping animals;</b> therefore <b>the verse states “only,”</b> a term used for exclusion, indicating that creeping animals are not included.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the derivation?</b> What is the proof that it is creeping animals that are excluded from this prohibition and not another type of animal? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The term <b>“its blood”</b> indicates that the prohibition pertains to animals <b>whose blood is</b> halakhically considered <b>separate from their flesh.</b> This <b>excludes creeping animals, whose blood is not</b> considered <b>separate from their flesh.</b>",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the assertion that eating meat was prohibited to Adam, from the verse: <b>“And have dominion over the fish of the sea,</b> and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creeps upon the land” (Genesis 1:28). <b>What, is it not</b> stated <b>with regard to consumption,</b> i.e., doesn’t this verse mean that people may eat the meat of animals? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the verse is referring <b>to</b> using animals for <b>labor.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But are fish capable of</b> performing <b>labor?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> they are capable, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Raḥava; as Raḥava asked</b> the following question: If one <b>drove</b> a wagon to which <b>a goat and a <i>shibbuta</i></b> fish were harnessed together, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Has he violated the prohibition of diverse kinds, in the same way that one does when plowing with an ox and a donkey together? In any event, Raḥava’s question indicates that there is a way, albeit far-fetched, for a fish to perform labor.",
    "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that it was permitted for Adam to eat meat, from the phrase in the aforementioned verse: “And have dominion…<b>and over the fowl of the air.” What, is it not</b> stated with regard <b>to consumption?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring <b>to labor.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But are birds capable of</b> performing <b>labor?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> they are capable, <b>as Rabba bar Rav Huna raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>threshed with geese and chickens, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, derives from the verse: “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads” (Deuteronomy 25:4), that a laborer in a field is entitled to eat from the produce during his work only if his work involves both his hands and his feet, like an ox, which treads with its forelegs as well as its hind legs. Rabba bar Rav Huna raises a dilemma as to whether the prohibition against muzzling an animal while it is being used for labor in the field applies to geese and chickens, which have only two feet. In any event, it is indicated in that dilemma that birds can perform labor.",
    "<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the phrase: “And have dominion…<b>and over every living thing that creeps upon the land.”</b> Creeping animals certainly cannot be used for labor. Apparently, the verse is referring to eating them. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase <b>comes to include</b> the <b>snake,</b> which was capable of performing labor when it was created.",
    "<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: Woe over a great attendant that has been lost to the world; as had the snake not been cursed</b> that it should go on its belly, <b>there would have been two fine snakes at the disposal of each and every one of the Jewish people. One he would send to the north, and</b> the other <b>one he would send to the south, to bring him precious <i>sandalbonim</i>,</b> a type of precious stone, <b>and</b> other <b>precious stones and pearls. Moreover,</b> he would <b>attach a strap under</b> his snake’s <b>tail</b> like a harness to an animal, <b>and use it to take dirt out to his garden and to</b> rebuild <b>his ruin,</b> as he does with other animals. This demonstrates that the snake was capable of performing labor.",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the assertion that eating meat was prohibited to Adam: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Teima would say: Adam, the first</b> man, <b>would dine in the Garden of Eden, and the ministering angels would roast meat for him and strain wine for him. The snake glanced at him and saw his glory, and was jealous of him,</b> and for that reason the snake incited him to sin and caused his banishment from the Garden. According to this, evidently Adam would eat meat. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> the reference is <b>to meat that descended from heaven,</b> which was created by a miracle and was not the meat of animals at all.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is there</b> such a thing as <b>meat that descends from heaven?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is like this</b> incident: <b>As Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta was walking along the way, he encountered those lions that were roaring at him,</b> intending to eat him. <b>He said: “The young lions roar after their prey,</b> and seek their food from God” (Psalms 104:21), and they deserve to receive food. <b>Two thighs</b> of an animal <b>descended</b> from heaven <b>for him.</b> The lions <b>ate one</b> of these thighs, <b>and they left</b> the other <b>one. He took it and entered the study hall,</b> and <b>inquired about it: Is this</b> thigh <b>a kosher item or a non-kosher item?</b> The Sages <b>said to him:</b> Certainly it is kosher, as <b>a non-kosher item does not descend from heaven.</b>",
    "In connection to that story, it is related that <b>Rabbi Zeira asked Rabbi Abbahu:</b> If <b>the likeness of a donkey had descended for him, what</b> would the <i>halakha</i> have been? Would it have been permitted? Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: Foolish bird [<i>yarud nala</i>].</b> The Sages already <b>said to him</b> that <b>a non-kosher item does not descend from heaven;</b> therefore, it must be kosher.",
    "§ In the <i>baraita</i> that lists the Noahide mitzvot (56a), it is stated that <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the descendants of Noah were <b>also</b> commanded <b>concerning</b> the prohibition against engaging in <b>sorcery.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> behind the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written:</b>"
