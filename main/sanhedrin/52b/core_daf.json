    "<b>To what is a Torah scholar compared</b> when he is standing <b>before an ignoramus? At first,</b> when he does not know him, the ignoramus considers him to be <b>like a goblet [<i>lekiton</i>] of gold.</b> Once <b>he has conversed with him</b> concerning mundane matters, he considers him to be <b>like a goblet of silver,</b> i.e., the stature of the Torah scholar is downgraded in the eyes of the ignoramus. Once the scholar <b>has received benefit from</b> the ignoramus, <b>he</b> considers him to be <b>like an earthenware goblet,</b> which <b>once broken cannot be fixed.</b>",
    "The Gemara relates: <b>Imrata bat Talei was a priest’s daughter who committed adultery. Rav Ḥama bar Toviyya surrounded her</b> with <b>bundles of branches and burned her.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Yosef says:</b> Rav Ḥama bar Toviyya <b>erred with regard to two</b> <i>halakhot</i>. <b>He erred with regard to</b> the ruling <b>of Rav Mattana,</b> i.e., that burning is performed using a wick of lead, <b>and he erred with regard to that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge that will be in those days”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:9), that <b>at a time when there is a priest</b> serving in the Temple, i.e., when the Temple is built, <b>there is judgment</b> of capital cases. By inference, <b>at a time when there is no priest, there is no judgment</b> of capital cases.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: An incident</b> occurred <b>with regard to a priest’s daughter who committed adultery,</b> and she was executed by actual burning, and the Sages said to him that the court at that time was not proficient in <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav Yosef says: It was a court of the Sadducees,</b> who interpreted the verse according to its straightforward meaning.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Did</b> Rabbi Elazar ben Tzadok <b>say that to</b> the Sages, <b>and did</b> the Sages <b>answer him in that manner? But isn’t</b> a different version of the exchange <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: I remember when I was a child, and was riding on</b> my <b>father’s shoulders. And they brought a priest’s daughter who had committed adultery, and surrounded her</b> with <b>bundles of branches and burned her.</b> The Sages <b>said to him: You were a minor</b> at that time <b>and one cannot bring proof from</b> the testimony of <b>a minor,</b> as perhaps you did not understand the proceedings properly. The two versions of this exchange do not accord with each other. The Gemara answers: <b>There were two</b> separate <b>incidents,</b> and Rabbi Elazar ben Tzadok testified with regard to both.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> incident <b>did he tell</b> the Sages about <b>first? If we say</b> that <b>first he told them</b> about <b>this first</b> incident, i.e., the one that is recounted in the mishna, this is unreasonable; if he first <b>told</b> them about the incident that occurred <b>when he was an adult, and they paid no attention to him,</b> but rejected his statement by responding that the court was not proficient in <i>halakha</i>, <b>would he tell</b> them afterward about the incident that occurred <b>when he was a small child and</b> think that <b>they would pay attention to him?</b>",
    "<b>Rather,</b> it is clear that <b>he first told them</b> about <b>that</b> incident, i.e., the one recounted in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and they said to him: You were a minor,</b> and one cannot bring proof from the testimony of a minor. <b>And</b> then <b>he told them</b> about the incident that occurred <b>when he was an adult, and they said to him:</b> The court did so <b>because the court at that time was not proficient</b> in <i>halakha</i>.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The mitzva of those who are killed,</b> i.e., the process of execution by decapitation, is carried out in the following manner: The executioners <b>cut off his head with a sword, the way that the monarchy does</b> when a king sentences a person to death. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This manner of execution is improper, as <b>it degrades him. Rather, they place the head of</b> the condemned <b>on the block, and chop</b> it off <b>with a cleaver [<i>bekofitz</i>].</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> If you are concerned about his degradation, <b>there is no death</b> penalty more <b>degrading than that.</b> It is better for him to be executed in the manner described first.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:3): <b>Rabbi Yehuda said to the Rabbis: I too, know that it is a degrading death, but what shall I do, as the Torah states: “And you shall not follow their statutes”</b> (Leviticus 18:3), i.e., it is prohibited to adopt the practices of the gentiles.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> decapitation by the <b>sword is written in the Torah, it is not from</b> the gentiles that <b>we learn</b> it. This is Torah law, and the custom of the gentiles is not taken into consideration. It is of no import that they have a corresponding type of execution.",
    "<b>As, if you do not say so,</b> that a Jewish custom is not forbidden even if the gentiles have the same custom, then <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> poses a difficulty. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>One burns</b> vessels and clothes <b>over</b> the deaths of <b>kings</b> as an expression of grief, <b>and</b> this is <b>not</b> forbidden <b>for</b> being <b>of the ways of the Amorites. How can we perform</b> this <b>burning? But isn’t it written: “And you shall not follow their statutes”? Rather, since burning</b> items over the death of a king <b>is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And with the burnings of your fathers,</b> the first kings who came before you, so shall they make a burning for you” (Jeremiah 34:5), it is <b>not from</b> the gentiles that <b>we learn</b> it. <b>And here too, since</b> decapitation by the <b>sword is written in the Torah,</b> it is <b>not from them</b> that <b>we learn</b> it.",
    "§ The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna <b>in another chapter</b> of this tractate (76b): <b>These</b> transgressors <b>are those who are killed</b> by decapitation: <b>The murderer and the people of an idolatrous city,</b> there is a difficulty. <b>Granted,</b> the people of <b>an idolatrous city</b> are executed in this manner, as <b>it is written concerning them:</b> “You shall smite the inhabitants of that city <b>with the edge of the sword”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:16). <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a murderer, from where do we</b> derive that he is executed by decapitation?",
    "The Gemara answers that it is derived <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated in the verse: “And if a man smites his slave or his maidservant by the staff and he dies under his hand, <b>he shall be avenged”</b> (Exodus 21:20). Prima facie, <b>I do not know what this vengeance is</b> referring to. <b>When it says: “And I will bring upon you the sword avenging the vengeance of the covenant”</b> (Leviticus 26:25), <b>you must say</b> that <b>vengeance is</b> decapitation by the <b>sword.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say that</b> the executioner <b>should stab him</b> with a sword, rather than decapitate him? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written</b> with regard to the people of an idolatrous city: <b>“With the edge of the sword,”</b> indicating that the execution should be administered with the edge of the sword and not its point.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But say that</b> the executioner <b>should cut him in half [<i>gistera</i>],</b> down the middle of his body. The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), which teaches that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, one should <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Cutting his body in half is not a compassionate manner of execution.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> proof that one <b>who killed</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> is executed by decapitation. But <b>from where do we</b> derive that one who kills <b>a freeman</b> is executed in the same manner?",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>But is it not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>?</b> If one who <b>killed</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> is executed <b>by</b> the <b>sword,</b> should one who killed <b>a freeman</b> be executed merely <b>by strangulation?</b>",
    "This Gemara rejects this answer: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>strangulation</b> is a more <b>lenient</b> type of capital punishment than decapitation. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>strangulation</b> is more <b>severe</b> than decapitation, <b>what can be said?</b> It is possible that one who murdered a freeman is in fact executed by strangulation.",
    "The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>derives it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And so shall you put away the innocent blood from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:9), that <b>all spillers of blood are compared to the heifer whose neck is broken</b> as atonement for an unresolved murder. <b>Just as there,</b> the heifer is killed <b>by</b> the <b>sword and at the neck, so too here,</b> murderers are executed <b>by</b> the <b>sword and at the neck.</b>",
    "The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> so, perhaps it should be derived that <b>just as there,</b> the heifer is decapitated <b>with a cleaver and at the nape of the neck, so too here,</b> murderers should be decapitated <b>with a cleaver and at the nape of the neck.</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <b>verse states: “And you shall love your neighbor as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), which teaches that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, one should <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Although the type of capital punishment is derived from the heifer whose neck is broken, the most compassionate method of decapitation is selected.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The mitzva of those who are strangled</b> is carried out in the following manner: The agents of the court <b>submerge</b> the condemned one <b>in dung up to his knees</b> so he cannot move, <b>and</b> one of them <b>places a rough scarf within a soft one, and wraps</b> it <b>around his neck. This</b> one, i.e., one of the witnesses, <b>pulls</b> the scarf <b>toward him, and that</b> one, the other witness, <b>pulls</b> it <b>toward him, until the soul of</b> the condemned one <b>departs.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “And a man who commits adultery with another man’s wife, even he who commits adultery with his neighbor’s wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death” (Leviticus 20:10). The term: <b>“A man,”</b> is interpreted as <b>excluding a minor boy</b> who committed adultery before he came of age. The phrase: <b>“Who commits adultery with another man’s wife,”</b> is interpreted as <b>excluding the wife of a minor boy;</b> marriage to a minor is not considered halakhic marriage. <b>“His neighbor’s wife” excludes the wife of another,</b> i.e., a gentile, who is not referred to as “his neighbor.”",
    "<b>“Shall be put to death”</b> means death <b>by strangulation. Do you say</b> that his execution is <b>by strangulation, or is it rather by one of all the</b> other types of <b>death</b> penalty <b>stated in the Torah? You must say</b> that it is by strangulation, as <b>everywhere that</b> the <b>death</b> penalty <b>is stated in the Torah without specification you may not take it to be more stringent with regard to it,</b> i.e., to mean that the sinner should be sentenced to <b>a severe</b> type of execution; <b>rather,</b> you must take it <b>to be more lenient with regard to it,</b> i.e., that a lenient type of execution should be applied. Consequently, the sinner is sentenced to be executed by strangulation, which is the least severe type of capital punishment. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: It is not because</b> strangulation <b>is</b> the most <b>lenient</b> type of capital punishment; <b>rather,</b> there is a principle that <b>every death</b> penalty <b>stated in the Torah without specification is nothing other than strangulation,</b> whereas the other types of capital punishment must be stated explicitly in the verse.",
    "<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan: <b>Death at the hand of Heaven is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>and death at the hands of a person,</b> i.e., court-imposed capital punishment, <b>is stated</b> in the Torah. <b>Just as</b> the <b>death at the hand of Heaven that is stated</b> in the Torah is <b>a death that leaves no</b> external <b>mark, so too,</b> the <b>death at the hands of a person that is stated</b> in the Torah is <b>a death that leaves no</b> external <b>mark,</b> i.e., strangulation.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that perhaps it is referring to execution by <b>burning,</b> which also leaves no external mark? The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One states</b> explicitly that <b>a priest’s daughter</b> who committed adultery is executed <b>by burning</b> one can learn <b>by inference that this</b> other woman who committed adultery <b>is not liable to</b> be executed by <b>burning,</b> but rather by a different type of execution that does not leave a mark, i.e., strangulation."
