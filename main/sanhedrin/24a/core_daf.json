    "is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>disqualified witnesses and fit judges,</b> i.e., the litigant claims that both the witnesses and the judges are disqualified and proves his claim only with regard to the witnesses. Rabbi Meir holds that <b>since the witnesses are disqualified the judges are also disqualified,</b> as the litigant’s entire claim is deemed credible. <b>The latter clause,</b> where Rabbi Meir rules that a litigant can disqualify witnesses, is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>disqualified judges and fit witnesses,</b> i.e., the litigant proves his claim only with regard to the judges. <b>Since the judges are disqualified the witnesses were also disqualified.</b>",
    "<b>Rava objects to this</b> interpretation: <b>Granted,</b> in the former clause, it is reasonable that <b>since the witnesses are disqualified the judges are also disqualified,</b> as, since <b>there is</b> the option of going to <b>another court,</b> disqualifying these specific judges has no irreversible effect on the outcome of the case. <b>But</b> in the latter case, how can Rabbi Meir hold that <b>since the judges are disqualified, the witnesses are also disqualified</b> without proof? This disqualification nullifies the entire case, as <b>there are no more witnesses.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mishna is not referring to a case where there are no other witnesses. The dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis is <b>necessary</b> only in a case <b>where there is another set</b> of witnesses, which the litigant did not disqualify. Since disqualifying this set will not predetermine the outcome, the litigant’s claim that these witnesses are disqualified is accepted.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if <b>there is no other set</b> of witnesses, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>indeed</b> true <b>that</b> the litigant <b>cannot disqualify</b> them? If so, <b>this is</b> identical to <b>Rav Dimi’s</b> interpretation that the mishna is referring to a case where there are two sets of witnesses.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the principle that <b>since [<i>miggo</i>]</b> one of the litigant’s claims is found to be correct, it can be assumed that other claims of his are correct as well. <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Ravin, <b>holds</b> that according to Rabbi Meir, <b>we say <i>miggo</i>,</b> i.e., this principle should be followed, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Dimi, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not say <i>miggo</i>,</b> but rather the litigant is required to prove every claim he makes.",
    "§ The Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Reish Lakish says: Would a holy mouth,</b> i.e., that of Rabbi Meir, <b>say this</b> strange <b>statement,</b> that a litigant can prevent a witness from testifying against him? Rather, emend the text of the mishna and <b>teach: His witness,</b> in the singular, meaning that a litigant can disqualify only a witness who testifies alone.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so?</b> Was it in character for Reish Lakish to speak of Rabbi Meir with such reverence when disagreeing with his ruling? <b>But doesn’t Ulla say:</b> When <b>one sees Reish Lakish</b> studying Torah <b>in the study hall</b> it is <b>as though he is uprooting mountains and grinding them into each other?</b> Reish Lakish was evidently very sharp in his analyses.",
    "<b>Ravina said</b> in response: What is the difficulty? <b>But is it not</b> so that when <b>anyone sees Rabbi Meir</b> studying Torah <b>in the study hall,</b> it is <b>as though he is uprooting the highest of mountains and grinding them into each other?</b> Rabbi Meir was a greater scholar than Reish Lakish, so it was fitting for Reish Lakish to speak of him with reverence.",
    "The Gemara answers: The question: Is that so, was not stated to raise a difficulty; rather, <b>this</b> is what he <b>is saying,</b> i.e., this is what the Gemara was noting: <b>Come and see how much</b> the Sages <b>love each other.</b> Although Reish Lakish was himself very sharp and a great Torah scholar, he spoke of Rabbi Meir with reverence.",
    "The Gemara cites another example of Torah scholars who spoke of each other with reverence. It is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>sat and said: It is prohibited to insulate cold</b> food on Shabbat to keep it cold, as this may lead one to insulate hot food on Shabbat to keep it hot. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said before him: My father</b> ruled that it is <b>permitted to insulate cold</b> food on Shabbat. There is no concern that this will lead one to insulate hot food on Shabbat. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi subsequently <b>said to</b> those who asked him about this issue: I retract my previous statement; <b>the elder,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>has already issued a ruling</b> on this topic, and I defer to his ruling.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa says: Come and see how much they loved each other. As, had Rabbi Yosei</b> still <b>been alive, he would have been subordinate</b> to <b>and sitting before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi as his student, <b>as Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, was his fathers’ replacement,</b> i.e., he was as great a Torah scholar as his forebears, <b>and he was subordinate</b> to <b>and sitting before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi as his student. <b>And,</b> nevertheless, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The elder has already issued a ruling</b> on this topic, and he deferred to Rabbi Yosei’s ruling.",
    "This demonstrates what <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And I took for myself two staves; the one I called Graciousness, and the other I called Binders”</b> (Zechariah 11:7)? <b>“Graciousness”; these are</b> the <b>Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael, who are gracious to one another in</b> discussions of <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> They treat each other with honor and love, as demonstrated in the statements of Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. <b>“Binders [<i>ḥovelim</i>]”; these are</b> the <b>Torah scholars in Babylonia, who injure [<i>shemeḥabbelim</i>] each other in</b> discussions of <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., they speak harshly to each other when they disagree.",
    "Similarly, it is stated: <b>“Then he said to me: These are the two anointed ones, that stand</b> by the Lord of the whole earth” (Zechariah 4:14), and it is stated: <b>“And two olive trees by it,</b> one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon its left side” (Zechariah 4:3). With regard to the expression <b>“anointed ones,” Rabbi Yitzḥak says: These are</b> the <b>Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael, who are pleasant to each other in</b> discussions of <b><i>halakha</i> like olive oil,</b> which is not bitter. The verse <b>“and two olive trees by it”</b> should be interpreted as follows: <b>These are</b> the <b>Torah scholars in Babylonia, who are bitter to each other in</b> discussions of <b><i>halakha</i> like an olive.</b>",
    "The Gemara interprets another verse in Zechariah: <b>“Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold there came forth two women, and the wind was in their wings, for they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the measure between the earth and the heaven. Then I said to the angel that spoke with me: To where do they take the measure? And he said to me: To build her a house in the land of Shinar”</b> (Zechariah 5:9–11). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: This</b> measure refers to <b>flattery and arrogance that descended to Babylonia,</b> i.e., Shinar.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And did arrogance descend to Babylonia? But doesn’t the Master say: Ten <i>kav</i></b> of <b>arrogance descended to the world; Eilam took nine and all</b> the rest of <b>the world in its entirety</b> took <b>one?</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it descended to Babylonia, and it made its way to Eilam.</b> The language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it is written: “To build her a house in the land of Shinar,”</b> which indicates that the original intention was to build a house in Babylonia, but it was not built there. The Gemara comments: <b>Conclude from it</b> that arrogance did not remain in Babylonia.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the Master say: A sign of arrogance</b> is <b>poverty? And poverty descended to Babylonia,</b> not to Eilam. The Gemara answers: To <b>what</b> kind of <b>poverty</b> is this referring? It is <b>poverty</b> with regard to <b>Torah,</b> which was characteristic of Eilam. <b>As it is written: “We have a little sister, and she has no breasts”</b> (Song of Songs 8:8), and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This</b> refers to <b>Eilam, whose</b> inhabitants <b>merited to learn</b> Torah <b>but did not merit to teach</b> it. They did not produce Torah scholars capable of imparting their wisdom to others.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the homiletic interpretation of the word <b>Babylonia? Rabbi Yoḥanan says,</b> as a tribute to the Jewish community of Babylonia and its Torah scholars: It means <b>mixed with Bible, mixed with Mishna,</b> and <b>mixed with Talmud.</b> Other Sages had a different opinion of the Torah in Babylonia: With regard to the verse: <b>“He has made me dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead”</b> (Lamentations 3:6), <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: This is the Talmud of Babylonia,</b> which is not as clear as the Talmud of Eretz Yisrael.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one litigant <b>says to</b> the other: <b>My father is trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> or: <b>Your father is trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> or: <b>Three cattle herders,</b> who are not proficient in <i>halakha</i>, <b>are trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> all of whom are disqualified from serving as judges, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The one who made the offer <b>can retract it, and the Rabbis say: He cannot retract it,</b> but must accept their verdict.",
    "Similarly, one who <b>was obligated</b> by Torah law to take <b>an oath to another,</b> which is done while grasping a sacred object, <b>and</b> the latter <b>said to him:</b> Instead of taking an oath, merely <b>vow to me by the life of your head</b> that what you claim is true, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The one who made the offer <b>can retract it,</b> and demand that the other litigant take an oath, as he is obligated to do by Torah law. <b>And the Rabbis say: He cannot retract</b> his offer. Once he has agreed to accept a vow, which is of less severity than an oath, he cannot retract his agreement.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Dimi, son of Rav Naḥman, son of Rav Yosef, says:</b> The case of a litigant who accepts his father or the father of the other litigant as a judge is referring to <b>where</b> the litigant <b>accepted</b> this relative <b>upon himself as one</b> of the judges in a court of three, where the other two judges are fit. It is not referring to where he accepted him as the sole judge.",
    "<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis is <b>with regard to</b> a case where the claimant had said to the defendant: The money I claim you owe me is <b>forgiven you</b> if my father or your father rules as judge to that effect, and the claimant subsequently wishes to retract his offer. <b>But in</b> a case where it is the defendant who said: <b>I will give you</b> what you claim if that is the ruling of this judge, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>he can retract</b> his offer. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is <b>with regard to</b> a case where the defendant said: <b>I will give you</b> what you claim if that is the ruling of this judge.",
    "<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Is the <b>dispute</b> only <b>with regard to</b> a case where the defendant says: <b>I will give you, but in</b> a case where the claimant says: The money I claim you owe me is <b>forgiven you, everyone agrees</b> that <b>he cannot retract</b> his offer? <b>Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that the <b>dispute is both with regard to this</b> case <b>and with regard to that</b> case?",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that <b>which Rava says:</b> The <b>dispute is with regard to</b> a case where the defendant says: <b>I will give you, but in</b> a case where the claimant says: The money I claim you owe me is <b>forgiven you, everyone agrees</b> that <b>he cannot retract</b> his offer.",
    "<b>Granted,</b> this makes sense <b>if you say</b> that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan too, the <b>dispute</b> is <b>with regard to</b> a case where the defendant says: <b>I will give you, but in</b> a case where the claimant says: The money I claim you owe me is <b>forgiven you, everyone agrees</b> that <b>he cannot retract</b> his offer; this means that <b>Rava is stating</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan. But if you say</b> that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan the <b>dispute is both with regard to this</b> case <b>and with regard to that</b> case, then <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is Rava stating</b> the <i>halakha</i>? His statement is in accordance with neither Shmuel’s opinion nor Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion.",
    "The Gemara rejects this: Perhaps <b>Rava is stating his own explanation</b> of the dispute.",
    "<b>Rav Aḥa bar Taḥlifa raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava</b> from the latter clause in the mishna: With regard to one who <b>was obligated</b> by Torah law to take <b>an oath to another, and</b> the latter <b>said to him: Vow to me by the life of your head</b> that what you claim is true, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The one who made the offer <b>can retract it; and the Rabbis say: He cannot retract</b> his offer."
