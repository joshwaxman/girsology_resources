    "<b>are one</b> prohibition.",
    "<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this is the reason of Isi</b> for exempting women from the prohibition against baldness: <b>As he learns</b> the prohibition against causing <b>baldness</b> in grief over someone who is dead through a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the prohibition against causing <b>baldness</b> stated with regard to <b>the sons of Aaron.</b> The verse states with regard to priests: “They shall not make baldness upon their head” (Leviticus 21:5). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to priests, <b>women are exempt,</b> as the expression “the sons of Aaron” serves to exclude the daughters of Aaron, <b>so too here, women are exempt.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But if we maintain that when</b> the Merciful One <b>writes:</b> “The sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 21:1), it <b>is written with regard to the entire matter</b> of that chapter, including the prohibition against causing baldness, <b>let the verse be silent about</b> this prohibition concerning all Jews. <b>And</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>could be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as <b>I</b> could <b>say</b> the following: <b>If</b> in the case of <b>priests, for whom the verse includes additional mitzvot,</b> the prohibition against causing baldness applies only to <b>the sons of Aaron and not the daughters of Aaron,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case with regard to <b>Israelites,</b> who have fewer mitzvot, that only the men should be obligated and not the women?",
    "The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, the verbal analogy is necessary. As, <b>were it not for</b> the <b>verbal analogy I would say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and the prohibition against causing baldness applies to all the descendants of Aaron, including women.",
    "The Gemara asks: If so, <b>now too, let us say</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>that matter,</b> and it is prohibited for the daughters of Aaron as well to cause baldness. <b>And if</b> you maintain that the reason the prohibition stated with regard to priests does not apply to women is <b>due to</b> the <b>verbal analogy</b> employing the term “make baldness,” which serves to connect the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to priests with the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to all Jews, this verbal analogy <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“They shall not make baldness [<i>yikreḥu</i></b> <i>korḥa</i>]” (Leviticus 21:5). If the verse had stated only “<i>yikreḥu</i>,” one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>one made four or five</b> patches of <b>baldness he would be obligated</b> for <b>only one</b> violation, as there is only one prohibition against making a bald spot. Therefore <b>the verse also states “<i>korḥa</i>,” to render him liable for each and every one</b> of the bald spots.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Upon their head”</b> (Leviticus 21:5), with regard to the prohibition against a priest causing baldness? <b>Because it is stated: “You shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he is obligated only for</b> removing the hair <b>between the eyes. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the entire head</b> in this prohibition? When <b>the verse states “upon their head,”</b> it serves <b>to render</b> a priest <b>liable</b> for removing hair <b>on</b> his entire <b>head like</b> the spot <b>between the eyes.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>priests, for whom the verse includes additional mitzvot; from where do we</b> derive that it applies to every <b>Israelite,</b> i.e., all Jews are liable for each and every bald spot and for the entire head? <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to priests, <b>“baldness,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to non-priests, <b>“baldness.” Just as here,</b> with regard to priests, <b>one is obligated for each and every bald spot, and one is obligated for the entire head like</b> the spot <b>between the eyes, so too there,</b> with regard to all Jews, <b>one is obligated for each and every bald spot, and one is obligated for the entire head like</b> the spot <b>between the eyes.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> conversely, <b>just as there,</b> in the case of Israelites, it is referring specifically to causing baldness <b>over</b> someone who is <b>dead, so too here,</b> with regard to priests, it is prohibited to cause baldness only <b>over</b> someone who is <b>dead,</b> not in other circumstances. This <i>baraita</i> shows that the verbal analogy is required for the <i>halakhot</i> of bald spots. How, then, can it teach the exemption of women? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that it may be used only for one purpose, <b>let the verse be written</b> merely <b>bald [<i>keraḥ</i>]. What</b> is meant by the term <b>“baldness [<i>korḥa</i>]”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> both the verbal analogy that exempts women and the <i>halakha</i> that each bald spot constitutes a separate violation.",
    "<b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is Isi’s reason, as he derives</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“between your eyes”</b> with regard to baldness <b>from phylacteries,</b> concerning which it says: “And they shall be for frontlets between your eyes” (Deuteronomy 11:18): <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to phylacteries, <b>women are exempt, so too here,</b> in the case of baldness, <b>women are exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rava did not state</b> the same reason <b>as Abaye?</b> The Gemara answers: Rava <b>does not learn</b> anything from the distinction between <b><i>keraḥ</i></b> and <b><i>korḥa</i>,</b> as he maintains that no <i>halakha</i> can be derived from this slight difference in language.",
    "The Gemara further asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Abaye did not state</b> the same reason <b>as Rava?</b> The Gemara answers that Abaye could have <b>said to you: Phylacteries themselves are derived from here,</b> i.e., the meaning of the phrase “between your eyes” stated with regard to phylacteries is understood from the case of baldness: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a bald spot, “between your eyes” is referring to <b>a place where baldness is formed,</b> a spot where there is hair, which is <b>on the upper part of the head</b> but not actually between the eyes, <b>so too, the place</b> where phylacteries are <b>donned is on the upper part of the head.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And both Abaye and Rava, what do they derive from this</b> verse: <b>“You are the sons</b> to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 14:1)? According to the first explanation of Isi’s opinion, the exclusion of women is derived from this phrase, whereas they derive that <i>halakha</i> from a different source. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“You are the sons to the Lord your God,”</b> indicates that <b>when you act like sons</b> and cleave to the Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>you are called sons,</b> but when <b>you do not act like sons you are not called sons.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Meir says: Either way you are</b> still <b>called sons, as it is stated: “They are foolish sons”</b> (Jeremiah 4:22). <b>And it</b> also <b>states: “Sons in whom there is no faithfulness”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:20). <b>And it states: “A seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly”</b> (Isaiah 1:4). <b>And it states: “And it shall come to pass that, instead of what was said to them: You are not My people, it shall be said to them: Sons of the living God”</b> (Hosea 2:1).",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is it necessary to cite these additional proofs introduced by the phrase: <b>And it states?</b> All these verses apparently make the same point. The Gemara explains why all the quotes are necessary. <b>And if you would say:</b> Granted, when they are <b>foolish they are</b> still <b>called sons,</b> as the verse states: “Foolish sons,” but <b>when they do not have faithfulness they are not called sons;</b> therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> another verse. <b>And</b> that verse <b>states: “Sons in whom there is no faithfulness.”</b>",
    "<b>And if you would say: It is when they do not have faithfulness that they are called sons,</b> as stated, but <b>when</b> they <b>worship idols they are not called sons</b> anymore; therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: And</b> the verse <b>states: “A seed of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly,”</b> which alludes to the corruption of idol worship. <b>And if you would say</b> that although <b>they are called “sons who deal corruptly,” they are no</b> longer <b>called full-fledged sons</b> of God once they have sinned, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: And</b> the <b>verse states: “And it shall come to pass that, instead of what was said to them: You are not My people, it shall be said to them: Sons of the living God.”</b> This verse indicates that when the Jews repent they are again called full-fledged sons of God.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the placing</b> of <b>hands</b> on the head of an offering, <b>and the waving</b> of certain offerings, <b>and the bringing near</b> of meal-offerings to the corner of the altar, <b>and the removal of a handful</b> from meal-offerings, <b>and the burning</b> of sacrificial parts on the altar, <b>and the pinching</b> of bird-offerings, <b>and the collecting</b> of blood of offerings in a vessel, <b>and the sprinkling</b> of blood, these <b>apply to men and not to women.</b> All these mitzvot apply specifically to men and not to women, <b>except for the meal-offering of a <i>sota</i>, and</b> the meal-offering of <b>a nazirite woman, which</b> these women <b>wave.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> From where is it derived that <b>placing</b> of <b>hands</b> on the head of an offering applies only to men? <b>As it is written: “Speak to the sons of Israel…and he shall place</b> his hand” (Leviticus 1:2–4), which indicates that <b>the sons of Israel place hands</b> on offerings, <b>but the daughters of Israel do not place hands.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains that the <i>halakha</i> of <b>waving</b> is derived from the following verse: <b>“Speak to the sons of Israel…and he shall wave”</b> (see Leviticus 7:29–30), which likewise teaches that <b>the sons of Israel wave, but the daughters of Israel do not wave.</b>",
    "§ With regard to <b>bringing near,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And this is the law of the meal-offering: The sons of Aaron shall bring it near”</b> (Leviticus 6:7). This teaches that <b>the sons of Aaron</b> bring the meal-offering near, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b>",
    "With regard to <b>the removal of a handful,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And he shall bring it to the sons of Aaron,</b> the priests, <b>and he shall remove a handful”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). This teaches that <b>the sons of Aaron</b> take a handful, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b>",
    "With regard to the <b>burning</b> of sacrificial parts, this is <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron shall burn it”</b> (Leviticus 3:5). This teaches that it is <b>the sons of Aaron</b> who burn the parts, <b>but not the daughters of Aaron.</b>",
    "With regard to <b>pinching,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And he shall pinch…and he shall burn”</b> (Leviticus 1:15). The verse <b>juxtaposes killing to burning,</b> and just as the burning of an offering must be performed by men, so too pinching may be performed only by men.",
    "With regard to <b>receiving,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And the sons of Aaron shall present</b> the blood” (Leviticus 1:5). <b>And the Master said</b> in explanation of this verse:"
