    "<b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If the baby’s lineage were unfit, his parents would not have gone to the trouble of circumcising him. Likewise, if <b>his limbs are adjusted,</b> indicating that he was cared for after birth, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> Similarly, if he was <b>anointed with oil, or</b> if his eyes <b>were smeared with</b> eye <b>salve,</b> or if he was <b>adorned with rings,</b> or if <b>a note [<i>pitka</i>] was hanging</b> on him, <b>or</b> if <b>an amulet was hanging</b> on him, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b>",
    "Concerning a child found <b>hanging from a palm tree, if</b> he was in such a place that <b>an animal could reach him, he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling. If not,</b> if he was placed on a palm tree in a way that he could not be reached by an animal, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling,</b> since he was cared for enough to be placed in a safe location.",
    "Similarly, if the child was placed in <b>a thicket near a town,</b> where people are not commonly found, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling. But if not, he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If the child was discovered <b>in a synagogue near a town, and people are commonly found there, he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling,</b> since the parents wanted to give him to others. <b>But if not,</b> if the synagogue was not near a town or if it was not frequented by people, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b>",
    "<b>Ameimar said:</b> With regard to <b>this cistern into which date pits are placed [<i>peira desuflei</i>]</b> as animal fodder, if a child is found there, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If he was found <b>in the middle of</b> a fast-flowing <b>river</b> with boats passing by, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If he was placed <b>at the side</b> of the river, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> If he was found at <b>the sides of a public domain,</b> which is not frequented by many people, <b>he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> But if the child was discovered in <b>the public domain</b> itself, where he might easily be trampled, <b>he is subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b>",
    "<b>Rava said: And in famine years, he is not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a foundling.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rava, to which</b> specific case is it referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to the</b> case where the child was left in the <b>public domain because it is a famine year,</b> would a mother <b>kill him</b> by placing him in a place where he is likely to be trampled? <b>Rather,</b> if Rava’s statement is referring <b>to the</b> case where the child was found at the <b>sides of a public domain, why specifically</b> mention <b>famine years? Even when</b> it is <b>not famine years,</b> the child was placed in a safe location where he was likely to be found.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>when Rava’s</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>was stated,</b> it was stated <b>with regard to that which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Zavdi says</b> that <b>Rav says: As long as</b> the abandoned child is still <b>in the marketplace, his father and mother are deemed credible with regard to him</b> when they later claim the child as theirs. But once the child has been <b>collected from the marketplace, they are no</b> longer <b>deemed credible with regard to him.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rava said: Since</b> the child <b>has</b> already <b>been publicized with the name of</b> being of flawed lineage as <b>a foundling,</b> they cannot change the status of the child. <b>And</b> it is with regard to this <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rava says: And in famine years, although</b> the child <b>has been collected from the marketplace, his father and mother are deemed credible with regard to him,</b> as it is common even for parents of unflawed lineage to abandon their children in famine years, and it is likely that they are speaking the truth.",
    "§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> There are <b>three</b> cases where people <b>are deemed credible</b> if they <b>immediately</b> offer testimony with regard to a matter about which they are not ordinarily deemed credible to testify. <b>These are they: A foundling, a midwife, and one who exempts her friends</b> from uncertain impurity.",
    "How so? The case of <b>a foundling</b> is <b>that which we said,</b> that his parents can testify with regard to his lineage before he is collected from the marketplace.",
    "The case of <b>a midwife</b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A midwife is deemed credible to say</b> that <b>this</b> child <b>emerged first</b> from the womb <b>and that</b> child <b>emerged second</b> from the womb. Her testimony is relied upon to determine which of them is the firstborn. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When she has not left</b> the birthing room <b>and returned. But if she left</b> the birthing room <b>and returned, she is not deemed credible,</b> since the babies might have been exchanged in the meantime. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> If <b>she has stood in her place, she is deemed credible. But if not, she is not deemed credible.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The difference between them</b> is in a case <b>when</b> the midwife <b>turned her head</b> aside after the birth. According to Rabbi Eliezer she is no longer deemed credible, despite having remained in the room.",
    "<b>What is</b> the case of <b>one who exempts her friends? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 60b): If there were <b>three women who were sleeping in one bed, and blood was found beneath one of them, they are all</b> deemed <b>impure</b> as menstruating women, as it is not known from which of them the blood came. If <b>one of them examined</b> herself <b>and was found</b> to be <b>impure,</b> i.e., she saw that she was menstruating, <b>she is impure and all</b> the rest <b>are pure.</b> With regard to this, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This applies provided <b>that she examined herself</b> within the <b>period of time</b> needed for the onset of <b>menstruation,</b> i.e., immediately after the discovery of the blood. But if she did so even a short while later, her discovery is not accepted as proof with regard to the source of the blood.",
    "<b>The Sages taught:</b> If several women gave birth at the same time, the <b>midwife</b> is <b>deemed credible to say: This</b> baby <b>is a priest and that</b> baby <b>is a Levite; this</b> baby <b>is a Gibeonite and that</b> baby <b>is a <i>mamzer</i>.</b> In other words, she is deemed credible to say which baby was born to which mother. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When no objection was registered about it. But if an objection was registered about it, she is not deemed credible.</b>",
    "The Gemara clarifies: <b>An objection of what</b> type? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>an objection of one</b> witness claiming that her testimony is not accurate, <b>but doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: There is no objection</b> with <b>less than two</b> witnesses? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must refer to the <b>objection of two</b> witnesses, but she is deemed credible when contradicted by a single witness.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say: Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that she is not deemed credible even when contradicted by the <b>objection of one</b> witness, <b>and when Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that <b>there is no objection</b> with <b>less than two</b> witnesses, <b>that statement</b> applies <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is a presumption of validity,</b> which can be countered only by the objection of two witnesses. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where there is no presumption</b> of <b>validity,</b> such as in this case, when the baby was just born, <b>one</b> witness <b>is also deemed credible</b> to object.",
    "Similarly, if the <b>owner of</b> an item being <b>purchased</b> is confronted by two people, each claiming to have purchased the item, he is <b>deemed credible to say: I sold to this</b> one, <b>and I did not sell to that</b> one. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When the</b> item being <b>purchased is</b> still <b>in</b> the seller’s <b>possession. But if the</b> item being <b>purchased is not in his possession, he is not deemed credible</b> any more than a single witness is."
