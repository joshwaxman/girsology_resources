    "the cases of an animal <b>set aside</b> as an offering to an idol, <b>and</b> an animal that was itself <b>worshipped</b> as an idol, <b>which are living creatures and</b> yet <b>are</b> permanently <b>forbidden.</b> The Gemara answers: There is a difference, as <b>when</b> they are <b>forbidden,</b> they are forbidden only to be used <b>for the Most High,</b> i.e., to be used as offerings in the Temple service, but it is permitted <b>for a common</b> Jew to derive benefit from them.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yirmeya objects to</b> the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>But</b> an animal that <b>copulated</b> with a woman, and an animal that <b>copulated</b> with a man, <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, they are living creatures and</b> yet they <b>are</b> permanently <b>forbidden,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that these animals are killed, and one is prohibited from deriving benefit from them once they have been sentenced. <b>Rather,</b> the above explanation should be emended to say: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: We have not found most</b> kosher <b>living creatures that are</b> permanently <b>forbidden</b> while they are still alive, and it can be assumed that the inclusion of the verse is referring to that which is generally forbidden, even if there are exceptions.",
    "The Gemara offers another answer to the question of how the <i>baraita</i> knew which bird the verse is permitting. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: The verse states: “And shall let go</b> the living bird <b>into the open field”</b> (Leviticus 14:7), which indicates that the bird is <b>like a field: Just as a field is permitted, so too, this</b> bird <b>is also permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: Is <b>that</b> word <b>“field” coming to</b> teach <b>this? That</b> word <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The word <b>“field”</b> teaches <b>that one may not stand in Jaffa and throw</b> the bird that is set free <b>to the sea,</b> or stand <b>in Gevat and throw it to the desert, and that he may not stand outside the city and throw it inside the city. Rather, any</b> manner in <b>which he is standing in the city and throws it outside the wall</b> to the field is valid. The word “field” teaches that one must set it free only to the field and nowhere else, not to teach that the bird is permitted.",
    "<b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, the school of Rabbi Yishmael, who derives that one is permitted to derive benefit from the bird based on the word “field,” replies: <b>If so,</b> that this was the only <i>halakha</i> the word is teaching, <b>let the Torah write “field”; what</b> is the significance of <b>“the field”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> i.e., both the place to throw the bird and the permission to derive benefit.",
    "<b>Rava says</b> a different answer to the question of how the <i>baraita</i> knew which bird the verse is permitting: <b>The Torah did not say “let go” for</b> it to serve as a <b>stumbling block.</b> If the bird sent free was forbidden, the Torah would not have commanded him to send it away, since people might eat it unwittingly.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman <b>with a nazirite’s hair,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a nazirite’s hair? The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“He shall be holy [<i>kadosh</i>], he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long”</b> (Numbers 6:5), which teaches: <b>His</b> hair <b>growth shall be holy.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the hair of a nazirite can be compared to consecrated property by use of the term “holy,” then <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>consecrated</b> property, it <b>transfers</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and</b> it <b>becomes desacralized, so too, a nazirite’s hair should transfer</b> its sanctity to the <b>money</b> with which <b>it</b> is redeemed <b>and</b> the hair itself should become <b>desacralized.</b> This is not the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>Do we read holy [<i>kodesh</i>]</b> in this verse, which is the term the verse uses for a consecrated item (see Leviticus 22:14)? <b>We read “holy [<i>kadosh</i>].”</b> Since a different conjugation of the term is used, the <i>halakhot</i> of the hair of a nazirite are not derived from those of consecrated property.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman <b>with a firstborn donkey,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a firstborn donkey,</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from it <b>is prohibited;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And Rabbi Shimon permits</b> it. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b> The mishna can be referring to one who betrothed a woman with a firstborn donkey <b>after</b> it has had its <b>neck broken, and everyone agrees</b> that it is prohibited to derive benefit from the donkey once its neck is broken.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman with <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from meat cooked in milk? <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The Torah states <b>three times: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Exodus 23:19; Exodus 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>One</b> verse serves to teach <b>the prohibition</b> against <b>eating</b> meat cooked in milk, <b>and one</b> verse serves to teach <b>the prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> from meat cooked in milk, <b>and one</b> verse serves to teach <b>the prohibition</b> against <b>cooking</b> meat in milk.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>prohibited to eat meat</b> cooked <b>in milk but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “For you are a holy people to the Lord your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and it states there</b> with regard to the prohibition of an unslaughtered animal carcass: <b>“And you shall be holy men to Me”</b> (Exodus 22:30). Since both verses employ the term “holy” he derives: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of an animal carcass, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, as the Torah explicitly states that it may be sold to a gentile, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that if a man betroths a woman with the items it enumerated, <b>or</b> with <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> she is not betrothed. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard, derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said in the name of Rabbi Meir: The Torah said: Slaughter for Me,</b> i.e., for offerings to God, <b>in My</b> place, inside the Temple courtyard, <b>and your</b> non-sacred animals that are intended for eating should be slaughtered <b>in your</b> place, outside the Temple courtyard. <b>Just as</b> one is <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>My</b> consecrated animals if they were slaughtered <b>in your</b> place, as one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a consecrated animal slaughtered outside the Temple, <b>so too,</b> one is <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>your</b> non-sacred animals if they were slaughtered <b>in My</b> place.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as</b> the act of slaughtering <b>My</b> consecrated animals <b>in your</b> place is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>, so too,</b> to the act of slaughtering <b>your</b> non-sacred animals <b>in My</b> place should be <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> To counter this logic, <b>the verse states:</b> “If a man from the house of Israel slaughters an ox or lamb…<b>and has not brought it to the door of the Tent of Meeting to sacrifice an offering to the Lord…and that man shall be cut off”</b> (Leviticus 17:3–4). This teaches that it is only <b>for an offering</b> that one slaughtered outside the Tent of Meeting of the Tabernacle, or the Temple courtyard, that <b>he is punishable with <i>karet</i>,</b> but <b>for non-sacred</b> animals that one slaughtered <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard he is not punishable with <i>karet</i>.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: In light of the above difference in <i>halakha</i> between these two cases, the entire comparison <b>can be refuted</b> in the following manner: <b>What</b> is an aspect unique <b>to</b> slaughtering <b>My</b> consecrated animals <b>in your</b> place? It <b>is</b> that it is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> and is therefore a severe prohibition, which could explain the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from them. The prohibition against slaughtering a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard, which is not punishable by <i>karet</i>, could be regarded as a less severe prohibition, and perhaps in this case it is permitted to derive benefit from the slaughtered animal. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard still does not have a source.",
    "Abaye quotes a lengthy <i>baraita</i> that serves as a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one is prohibited from deriving benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> it is derived <b>from here:</b> The Torah states <b>three verses that</b> have <b>a superfluous</b> element with regard to the various species from which one may bring a peace-offering: The verse <b>“and he slaughters it”</b> (Leviticus 3:2), the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:8), and the verse <b>“and he shall slaughter it”</b> (Leviticus 3:13). The Torah could simply have stated: “And he shall slaughter,” without adding: “It.” <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the term “it” these three times?",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: The source for the <i>halakha</i> is <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the ritual slaughter of animals for meat consumption: <b>“If the place</b> which the Lord your God shall choose to put His name there <b>be too far from you, then you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:21), from which it is derived: <b>When</b> you are <b>far from the place,</b> i.e., the Temple, <b>you may slaughter</b> non-sacred animals for meat consumption, <b>but you may not slaughter</b> non-sacred animals <b>in a near place,</b> i.e., in the Temple. The verse serves to <b>exclude non-sacred</b> animals, thereby teaching <b>that they may not be slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived the prohibition against slaughtering a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard <b>only</b> with regard to <b>unblemished</b> animals, <b>which are fit to be sacrificed. From where</b> do I know <b>to include</b> even <b>blemished</b> animals, which are not fit to be sacrificed, in this prohibition? <b>I include blemished</b> animals <b>since</b> they are at least of <b>the type that is fit</b> to be sacrificed. <b>From where</b> do I know <b>to include the undomesticated animal,</b> which is never sacrificed as an offering, in this prohibition? <b>I include the undomesticated animal since it</b> is rendered fit for consumption <b>by</b> means of <b>slaughtering, like a domesticated animal. From where</b> do I know <b>to include fowl,</b> as the Torah does not mention slaughter with regard to fowl, in this prohibition? <b>The verse states: “And he slaughters it,” “and he shall slaughter it,”</b> as well as <b>“and he shall slaughter it,”</b> employing the additional term “it” each time. These three verses teach that one may not slaughter any non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one may not slaughter</b> <i>ab initio</i> <b>but if he did slaughter it would be permitted for him</b> to eat it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If the place</b> which the Lord your God shall choose to put His name there <b>be too far from you, then you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock, which the Lord has given you, as I have commanded you, <b>and you shall eat</b> within your gates, after all the desire of your soul” (Deuteronomy 12:21), which is expounded as follows: <b>That which you slaughter in a far place,</b> outside the Temple, <b>you may eat, but you may not eat that which you slaughter in a near place,</b> which <b>excludes non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard.</b> Therefore, it is prohibited to eat a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard even after the fact.",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the prohibition against eating the meat after the fact applies to <b>unblemished</b> animals,"
