    "<b>soldiers [<i>nosei keisar</i>]</b> who <b>guarded me all night. They said to him: Perhaps a matter of forbidden intercourse presented itself to you and you were saved from it,</b> which is why a miracle occurred for you. <b>As we learned:</b> With regard to <b>anyone</b> to <b>whom a matter of forbidden intercourse presented itself to him and he was saved from it, a miracle is performed for him.</b> As it says: <b>“Mighty in strength who fulfill His word, hearkening to the voice of His word”</b> (Psalms 103:20). This is referring to one <b>such as Rabbi Tzadok and his colleagues.</b>",
    "To what is this referring? <b>Rabbi Tzadok was enticed by a certain noblewoman</b> to engage in sexual intercourse with her. <b>He said to her: My heart is weak and I am incapable</b> at present; is <b>there something to eat</b> that can strengthen me? <b>She said to him: There is something non-kosher. He said to her: What difference is there?</b> One <b>who performs such</b> an act <b>eats such</b> food as well. <b>She lit the oven</b> and <b>placed</b> the non-kosher food <b>in it</b> to roast. <b>He climbed and sat in</b> the oven. <b>She said to him: What</b> is the meaning of <b>this? He said to her:</b> One who <b>performs this</b> act <b>falls into this,</b> i.e., the fires of Gehenna. <b>She said to him: If I had known</b> that the matter was <b>so</b> serious for you, <b>I would not have</b> caused <b>you</b> such <b>anguish.</b>",
    "The Gemara further relates: <b>Rav Kahana would sell</b> baskets woven from <b>palm leaves</b> to women. <b>He was enticed by a certain noblewoman</b> to engage in intercourse with her. <b>He said to her:</b> Let me <b>go and adorn myself</b> beforehand. <b>He ascended</b> to the roof <b>and fell from the roof toward the ground. Elijah</b> the prophet <b>came</b> and <b>caught him.</b> Elijah the prophet <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>You have troubled me</b> to travel <b>four hundred parasangs [<i>parsei</i>]</b> to save you. Rav Kahana <b>said to him: What caused me</b> to be in this situation of temptation? Was it <b>not poverty,</b> as I am forced to engage in a trade that leads me to come into contact with women? Elijah <b>gave him a basket [<i>shifa</i>]</b> full <b>of dinars,</b> to spare him from having to work as a salesman.",
    "§ <b>Rava raises a contradiction to Rav Naḥman</b> and asks: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 1:1): <b>These</b> are the <b>matters that a person engages in and enjoys their profits in this world, and the principal</b> reward <b>remains for him for the World-to-Come,</b> and <b>they are: Honoring one’s father and mother, acts of loving kindness, and bringing peace between one person and another; and Torah study is equal to all of them.</b>",
    "Rava cites the source for each of these assertions. <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16), which indicates that one is rewarded in this world. <b>With regard to acts of loving kindness it is written: “He who pursues righteousness and kindness shall find life, prosperity, and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), all of which apply in this world.",
    "<b>And with regard to bringing peace it is written: “Seek peace and pursue it”</b> (Psalms 34:15). <b>And Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> This <b>is derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the term <b>pursuing</b> written with regard to pursuing peace and the term <b>pursuing</b> written in another verse. <b>It is written here: “Seek peace and pursue it,” and it is written there,</b> with regard to acts of kindness: <b>“Pursues righteousness and kindness.”</b> This teaches that one who pursues peace will also merit life, prosperity, and honor. <b>With regard to Torah study it is written: “For that is your life and the length of your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 30:20).",
    "Rava asked: <b>With regard to</b> the <b>dispatch</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest it is also written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), so <b>let him also teach this</b> mitzva. Rav Naḥman answered: He <b>taught</b> some cases <b>and omitted</b> others, i.e., the <i>tanna</i> did not list everything. Rava said to him: <b>The <i>tanna</i> taught: These</b> are the <b>matters,</b> which indicates that only these mitzvot are included, <b>and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that <b>he taught</b> some <b>and omitted</b> others?",
    "Rather, <b>Rava said: Rav Idi explained</b> the matter <b>to me.</b> The verse states: <b>“Say you of the righteous who is good, that they shall eat the fruit of their actions”</b> (Isaiah 3:10). <b>And</b> this verse is difficult, as <b>is there a righteous person who is good and is there a righteous person who is not good? Rather,</b> this verse should be understood as follows: One who is <b>good</b> both <b>toward Heaven and toward people is a good righteous person;</b> one who is <b>good toward Heaven but bad toward people is a righteous person who is not good.</b>",
    "Rava continues: <b>On a similar note,</b> it is written: <b>“Woe to the evil wicked one, for the work of his hands shall be done to him”</b> (Isaiah 3:11). <b>And is there a wicked man</b> who is <b>evil and is there</b> one <b>who is not evil? Rather,</b> one who is <b>evil toward Heaven and evil toward people is an evil wicked person;</b> and one who is <b>evil toward Heaven and not evil toward people is a wicked person who is not evil.</b> With regard to the issue at hand, only one who performs mitzvot that benefit others receives the profits of his mitzvot in this world. This does not apply to dispatching the mother bird, which is an act that does not benefit other people.",
    "§ With regard to the mishna in <i>Pe’a</i>, the Gemara states: An act of <b>merit has a principal</b> reward <b>and it has profits,</b> i.e., one receives additional reward beyond that which is granted for the mitzva itself, parallel to a principal sum and profits, <b>as it is stated: “Say you of the righteous who is good,</b> that they shall eat the fruit of their actions” (Isaiah 3:10). <b>A sin has a principal</b> penalty <b>but it has no profits,</b> i.e., no punishment beyond that, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to the evil wicked one,</b> for the work of his hands shall be done to him” (Isaiah 3:11), but no more than the work of his hands.",
    "<b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the following verse that deals with sinners: <b>“Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices”</b> (Proverbs 1:31)? This verse indicates that the penalty for sin goes beyond its principal, and the wicked receive additional punishments. The Gemara answers that this applies to <b>a sin that produces profits,</b> i.e., a case where there are practical consequences to one’s sin. For example, if others learn to act in a similar manner, one’s actions <b>have profits</b> with regard to punishment as well. Conversely, a sin <b>that does not produce profits does not have profits</b> as a punishment either.",
    "The Gemara further teaches: The Holy One, Blessed be He, <b>links a good thought to an action, as it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with the other, and the Lord listened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that fear the Lord, and that think upon His name”</b> (Malachi 3:16). The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“and that think upon His name”? Rav Asi said: Even</b> if <b>a person intended to perform a mitzva but due to</b> circumstances <b>beyond</b> his <b>control he did not perform it, the verse ascribes him</b> credit <b>as if he performed</b> the mitzva, as he is among those that think upon His name.",
    "But <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not link an evil thought to an action, as it is stated: “If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear”</b> (Psalms 66:18). <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Behold I will bring upon these people evil, even the fruit of their thoughts”</b> (Jeremiah 6:19)? In the case of an evil <b>thought that produces fruit,</b> i.e., that leads to an action, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, links it to</b> the <b>action</b> and one is punished for the thought as well. If it is <b>a thought that does not produce fruit, the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not link it to</b> the <b>action.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is written: “So I may take the house of Israel in their own heart”</b> (Ezekiel 14:5), which indicates that one can be punished for thoughts alone, to what is this verse referring? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: That is written with regard to idol worship, as the Master says: Idol worship is</b> very <b>severe, as anyone who denies it is like one who admits</b> the truth of <b>the entire Torah.</b> Conversely, one who embraces idolatry is considered to have rejected the entire Torah. Due to the severity of idol worship, one is punished even for contemplating this transgression.",
    "<b>Ulla said:</b> This should be explained <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: When a person transgresses and repeats</b> his transgression, <b>it is permitted to him.</b> The Gemara questions this statement: <b>Can it enter your mind that</b> the transgression <b>is permitted to him</b> because he has sinned twice? <b>Rather, it becomes as if</b> it were <b>permitted to him,</b> as he becomes accustomed to this behavior and no longer senses that it is a sin.",
    "<b>Rabbi Abbahu says in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina: It is preferable for a person to transgress in secret and not to desecrate the name of Heaven in public [<i>befarhesya</i>], as it is stated: “As for you, house of Israel, so says the Lord</b> God: <b>Go you, serve everyone his idols, even because you will not hearken to Me, but My sacred name you shall not profane”</b> (Ezekiel 20:39).",
    "<b>Rabbi Ilai the Elder says: If a person sees that his</b> evil <b>inclination is overcoming him, he should go to a place where he is not known, and wear black</b> clothes, <b>and he should cover himself in</b> simple <b>black</b> garments, <b>and he should do as his heart desires, but he should not desecrate the name of Heaven in public.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>anyone who does not care about his Creator’s honor, it is fitting for him not to have come into the world. What is this?</b> Who is considered to be one who does not care about his Creator’s honor? <b>Rabba says: This is one who gazes at a rainbow,</b> which is described as: “The likeness of the glory of the Lord” (Ezekiel 1:28). <b>Rav Yosef says: This is one who transgresses in secret,</b> which shows that he fears other people but does not care about the honor of his Creator.",
    "The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> source, which says that one who transgresses in secret does not care about his Creator’s honor, is referring <b>to one who can overcome his</b> evil <b>inclination</b> but nevertheless chooses to transgress in secret. <b>And that</b> source, which states that it is preferable for him to transgress in secret, is referring <b>to one who cannot overcome his</b> evil <b>inclination.</b>",
    "<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (see <i>Avot</i> 4:5): <b>Credit is not given with regard to the desecration of</b> God’s <b>name, whether</b> one sinned <b>unintentionally or intentionally.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Credit is not given [<i>makkifin</i>]? Mar Zutra says:</b> This means <b>that</b> God <b>does not act like a storekeeper</b> and provide credit. Rather, one is punished without delay. <b>Mar, son of Rabbana, says:</b> This means <b>to say that if</b> one’s merit and sins <b>were equal,</b> the sin of the desecration of God’s name <b>tilts</b> the balance of the scales toward the side of his sins. In other words, if his sins include the transgression of desecrating God’s name, God does not wait for this individual to perform a mitzva to balance out the sin.",
