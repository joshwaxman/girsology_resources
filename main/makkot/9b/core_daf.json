    "This Gemara questions that response. <b>Is it the wife of a prophet that is returned,</b> and the wife of one <b>who is not a prophet is not returned?</b>",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the explanation is <b>as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: This</b> is what God <b>is saying to</b> Abimelech: <b>“And now, restore the man’s wife”</b> (Genesis 20:7), <b>in any case,</b> whether or not he is a prophet. <b>And</b> as for <b>that which you said: “Will You even slay a righteous nation? Didn’t he say to me: She is my sister”</b> (Genesis 20:4–5), claiming that you are a victim of circumstances beyond your control and exempt from punishment, that is not a valid claim. <b>He is a prophet and</b> it is <b>from you</b> that <b>he learned</b> to conduct himself in that manner. With regard to <b>a stranger [<i>akhsenai</i>] who comes to the city, one asks him about matters of eating and drinking,</b> e.g., whether he is hungry or thirsty. <b>Does one ask him:</b> Is <b>that your wife?</b> Is <b>that your sister?</b> Abraham understood from this line of questioning that you are suspect with regard to abducting women, and that is the reason that he introduced Sarah as his sister. Therefore, you are liable to be executed for her abduction.",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that a descendant of Noah,</b> i.e., a gentile, <b>is executed</b> for a capital offense even if he says that it is permitted, <b>as he should have learned</b> that it is prohibited <b>and he did not learn.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A blind person</b> who unintentionally murdered another <b>is not exiled;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> He is <b>exiled. The enemy</b> of the victim <b>is not exiled,</b> as presumably it was not a completely unintentional act. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> Not only is <b>an enemy</b> not exiled, but he <b>is executed</b> by the court, <b>because</b> his halakhic status is <b>like</b> that of one who is <b>forewarned</b> by witnesses not to perform the action, as presumably he performed the action intentionally. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: There is an enemy who is exiled and there is an enemy who is not exiled. This is the principle:</b> In <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> an observer <b>could say he killed knowingly,</b> where circumstances lead to the assumption that it was an intentional act, the enemy <b>is not exiled,</b> even if he claims that he acted unintentionally. <b>And</b> if it is clear that <b>he killed unknowingly,</b> as circumstances indicate that he acted unintentionally, <b>he is exiled,</b> even though the victim is his enemy.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Apropos the dispute in the mishna between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Meir with regard to a blind person, <b>the Sages taught:</b> It is written that one is exiled to a city of refuge if he killed another <b>“without seeing”</b> (Numbers 35:23), indicating that the reference is to one who has the capacity to see. This serves <b>to exclude a blind person;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> On the contrary, the term <b>“without seeing”</b> serves <b>to include a blind person.</b>",
    "The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> It is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to those who are exiled: <b>“And as one who goes with his neighbor into the forest”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), which is stated in general terms, applying <b>even</b> to <b>a blind person.</b> The phrase <b>“without seeing” comes</b> and <b>excludes</b> a blind person from this <i>halakha</i>.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Meir</b> interprets the verses differently: <b>“Without seeing”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> a blind person, and <b>“without knowledge”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4) also serves <b>to exclude</b> a blind person. <b>This is</b> an example of <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression, and</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. In this case, it includes a blind person in the <i>halakhot</i> of exile as well.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to that derivation? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Yehuda says that the phrase <b>“without knowledge” comes to exclude one with intent,</b> e.g., one who had intent to kill an animal and who killed a person, from the <i>halakha</i> of exile. Rabbi Yehuda interprets the two restrictive expressions as excluding two unrelated cases from the <i>halakha</i> of exile, and therefore the principle of: A restrictive expression following a restrictive expression serves only to amplify, is not relevant in this case.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: An enemy is executed</b> because his halakhic status is like that of one who is forewarned. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is an enemy executed? The witness <b>did not</b> actually <b>forewarn him,</b> and courts administer corporal punishment only to a defendant who was forewarned. The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: One</b> who is <b>devoted to the meticulous observance of mitzvot [<i>ḥaver</i>] does not require forewarning</b> for the court to administer corporal punishment to him, <b>because</b> fundamentally the obligation to issue <b>forewarning was established only to distinguish between unwitting and intentional</b> actions. The presumptive status of a <i>ḥaver</i> is that of one who knows the <i>halakha</i>; therefore, his action is presumed to have been intentional.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: There is an enemy who is exiled</b> and there is an enemy who is not exiled. The Gemara adds: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>what</b> circumstances <b>did Rabbi Shimon say</b> that <b>there is an enemy who is exiled and there is an enemy who is not exiled?</b> He said that in a case where the rope <b>snapped</b> and the object attached to the rope fell and killed a person, he is <b>exiled,</b> as that appears to be an accident. But if an object <b>was displaced</b> from his hands, <b>he is not exiled,</b> as presumably he loosened his grip until it fell.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One is never exiled unless his trowel</b> with which he was working <b>was displaced from his hand?</b> As Rabbi Shimon stated that <i>halakha</i> without distinguishing between friend and enemy, therefore, the apparent contradiction between a case where the rope <b>snapped,</b> according to the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>and</b> a case where the rope <b>snapped,</b> according to the second <i>baraita</i>, is <b>difficult.</b> And the apparent contradiction between a case where the object <b>was displaced,</b> according to the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>and</b> a case where the object <b>was displaced,</b> according to the second <i>baraita</i>, is <b>difficult.</b>",
    "The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between a case where the rope <b>snapped</b> according to the first <i>baraita</i> <b>and</b> a case where the rope <b>snapped</b> according to the second is <b>not difficult. This</b> case in the second <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a friend</b> of the victim, and presumably if the rope snapped it is considered a case of circumstances beyond his control and he is exempt from exile, <b>and that</b> case in the first <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to an enemy</b> of the victim. In that case, although the presumption is that the act was not intentional, due to his enmity toward the victim, it is also not assumed to be the result of circumstances that were completely beyond his control. Therefore, he is exiled.",
    "The apparent contradiction between a case where the object <b>was displaced</b> according to the first <i>baraita</i> <b>and</b> a case where the object <b>was displaced</b> according to the second <i>baraita</i> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> case in the first <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who ruled in a mishna (7b) that if the blade of one’s ax was displaced from its handle and flew through the air and killed a person, he is exempt from exile, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>and that</b> case in the second <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who rule that in that case, the person wielding the ax is exiled, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>To where are</b> the unintentional murderers <b>exiled?</b> They are exiled <b>to cities of refuge, to three</b> cities <b>that</b> were <b>in</b> the east <b>bank of the Jordan and to three cities that</b> were <b>in the land of Canaan,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>as it is stated: “Three cities shall you give beyond the Jordan and three cities shall you give in the land of Canaan;</b> they shall be cities of refuge” (Numbers 35:14). The mishna comments: <b>Until</b> the <b>three</b> cities of refuge <b>that</b> were <b>in Eretz Yisrael were selected,</b> an unintentional murderer <b>would not be admitted</b> to the <b>three that</b> were <b>in</b> the east <b>bank of the Jordan,</b> even though the latter three were already selected by Moses (see Deuteronomy 4:41), <b>as it is stated: “Six cities of refuge shall they be”</b> (Numbers 35:13), from which it is derived that they do not become cities of refuge <b>until</b> all <b>six of them admit</b> unintentional murderers <b>as one.</b>",
    "The mishna continues: <b>And roads were aligned for them from this</b> city, i.e., all cities, <b>to that</b> city, i.e., they would pave and straighten the access roads to the cities of refuge, <b>as it is stated: “Prepare for you the road, and divide</b> the borders of your land, which the Lord your God causes you to inherit, into three parts, that every murderer may flee there” (Deuteronomy 19:3).",
    "<b>And</b> the court <b>would provide</b> the unintentional murderers fleeing to a city of refuge with <b>two Torah scholars,</b> due to the concern that <b>perhaps</b> the blood redeemer, i.e., a relative of the murder victim seeking to avenge his death, <b>will</b> seek to <b>kill him in transit, and</b> in that case <b>they,</b> the scholars, <b>will talk to</b> the blood redeemer and dissuade him from killing the unintentional murderer. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The unintentional murderer <b>also speaks [<i>medabber</i>] on his own behalf</b> to dissuade the blood redeemer, <b>as it is stated: “And this is the matter [<i>devar</i>] of the murderer,</b> who shall flee there and live” (Deuteronomy 19:4), indicating that the murderer himself speaks.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: Initially, either</b> one who killed another <b>unintentionally or</b> one who killed another <b>intentionally</b> would <b>hurry</b> and flee <b>to the cities of refuge, and the court</b> in his city would <b>send</b> for him <b>and</b> would <b>bring him from there</b> to stand trial. For <b>one who was</b> found <b>liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>in court</b> for intentional murder, the court would <b>execute him, and</b> for <b>one who was not</b> found <b>liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, e.g., if they deemed that the death occurred due to circumstances beyond his control, <b>they</b> would <b>free him.</b> For <b>one who was</b> found <b>liable to be exiled,</b> the court would <b>restore him to his place</b> in the city of refuge, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And the congregation shall judge between the murderer and the blood redeemer…<b>and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge,</b> that he fled there” (Numbers 35:24–25), indicating that he had been in a city of refuge before his trial.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: Moses designated three cities</b> of refuge <b>in the</b> east <b>bank of the Jordan, and corresponding to them, Joshua designated</b> three cities of refuge <b>in the land of Canaan. And the cities were aligned like two rows</b> of vines <b>in a vineyard:</b> In Eretz Yisrael there was <b>Hebron in Mount Judea, corresponding to Bezer in the wilderness; Shechem in Mount Ephraim, corresponding to Ramoth in the Gilead;</b> and <b>Kadesh in Mount Naphtali, corresponding to Golan in the Bashan.</b> From the term <b>“And you shall divide [<i>veshilashta</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:3), it is derived <b>that</b> the three cities in Eretz Yisrael will serve as <b>three [<i>meshulashin</i>]</b> lines of demarcation dividing the length of the land into four equal parts, in a manner <b>that</b> the distance <b>from the southern</b> border of Eretz Yisrael <b>to Hebron,</b> the southernmost city of refuge, <b>will be like</b> the distance <b>from Hebron to Shechem, and</b> the distance <b>from Hebron to Shechem</b> will be <b>like</b> the distance <b>from Shechem to Kadesh, and</b> the distance <b>from Shechem to Kadesh</b> will be <b>like</b> the distance <b>from Kadesh to the northern</b> border.",
    "The Gemara questions the distribution of the cities: Why were there <b>three</b> cities designated <b>on</b> the east <b>bank of the Jordan,</b> where two and a half tribes resided, and <b>three</b> cities designated <b>in Eretz Yisrael,</b> where more than nine tribes resided? <b>Abaye said: In Gilead,</b> which is located on the east bank of the Jordan, <b>murderers are common.</b>"
