    "He designates a portion of the produce by means of <b>calling the name</b> upon poor man’s tithe, <b>but he is not required to</b> physically <b>separate</b> that portion and give it to the poor.",
    "Rav Yosef suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to this: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that produce from which poor man’s tithe was <b>certainly</b> not separated <b>is rendered untithed produce,</b> and therefore, in a case where there is uncertainty whether poor man’s tithe was separated, one is required to separate it; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that produce from which poor man’s tithe was <b>certainly</b> not separated <b>is not rendered untithed produce,</b> and therefore, one need not even designate poor man’s tithe by calling its name upon a portion of the produce? <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>If</b> it is <b>so,</b> that this is the point in dispute, <b>rather than disagreeing with regard to</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> whether poor man’s tithe was separated, <b>let them disagree with regard to</b> a case of <b>certainty</b> that poor man’s tithe was not separated.",
    "<b>Rather,</b> contrary to the previous suggestion, say <b>that everyone agrees</b> that produce from which poor man’s tithe was <b>certainly</b> not separated <b>is rendered untithed produce. And here,</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds: <i>Amei ha’aretz</i> are not suspected of</b> refraining from separating <b>poor man’s tithe of <i>demai</i>. Since it is</b> merely a matter of <b>money,</b> and no sanctity is involved, <b>he separates</b> poor man’s tithe, although he does not actually give it to the poor. <b>And the Rabbis hold: Since the matter</b> involves <b>exertion for him, he does not</b> even <b>separate</b> poor man’s tithe.",
    "§ The mishna teaches: <b>How much does one</b> need to <b>eat from untithed produce</b> and be liable to receive lashes? Rabbi Shimon says: Even if one ate any amount of untithed produce he is liable to receive lashes. And the Rabbis say: He is liable only if he eats an olive-bulk. <b>Rav Beivai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> Their <b>dispute</b> is <b>with regard to</b> one who eats one kernel of <b>wheat</b> of untithed produce. <b>But with regard to flour, everyone agrees</b> that one is liable only if he eats <b>an olive-bulk. And Rabbi Yirmeya</b> says that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> Just <b>as</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to this</b> case of a kernel of wheat, <b>so too,</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to that</b> case of flour.",
    "The Gemara cites proof from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon said to them: Do you not concede to me with regard to one who eats an ant of any size that he is liable</b> to receive lashes? The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: He is flogged for eating an ant of any size <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> it is an intact entity in the form <b>of its creation.</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: One</b> kernel of <b>wheat is</b> also in the form <b>of its creation.</b> The Gemara infers from Rabbi Shimon’s response: For a kernel of <b>wheat, yes,</b> one is liable; for any amount of <b>flour, no,</b> one is not liable. Apparently, even Rabbi Shimon concedes that one is liable for eating only an olive-bulk of wheat flour, in accordance with the statement that Rav Beivai says that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says.",
    "The Gemara answers: It is in accordance <b>with</b> the <b>statement of</b> the Rabbis that Rabbi Shimon <b>spoke to them,</b> and he meant as follows: According <b>to my</b> opinion, <b>even</b> if one ate any amount of <b>flour</b> he is <b>also</b> liable. <b>But according to your</b> opinion, <b>concede to me at least that</b> one is liable if he eats <b>one</b> kernel of <b>wheat,</b> as it is in the form <b>of its creation. And the Rabbis</b> say in response: There is a difference; <b>an entity</b> with <b>a soul,</b> i.e., a living creature, <b>is significant,</b> and one is liable for eating an entity of any volume. A kernel of <b>wheat is not significant.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yirmeya,</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One who eats <b>any amount</b> of food that is forbidden is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes;</b> the Sages <b>said</b> the measure of <b>an olive-bulk only with regard to</b> liability to bring a sin-<b>offering</b> for one who unwittingly ate forbidden food.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a priest <b>who eats first fruits before</b> the one who brought the fruits to the Temple <b>recited over</b> those fruits the Torah verses that he is obligated to recite (see Deuteronomy 26:3–10); and one who ate <b>offerings of the most sacred order outside the curtains</b> surrounding the Tabernacle courtyard, or outside the Temple courtyard; and one who ate <b>offerings of lesser sanctity or second-tithe</b> produce <b>outside the wall</b> of Jerusalem; and also <b>one who breaks the bone of a ritually pure Paschal offering;</b> in all these cases <b>he is flogged</b> with <b>forty</b> lashes. <b>But one who leaves</b> the flesh <b>of the ritually pure</b> Paschal offering until the morning of the fifteenth of Nisan, <b>and one who breaks</b> a bone <b>of a ritually impure</b> Paschal offering, is <b>not flogged</b> with <b>forty</b> lashes.",
    "With regard to <b>one who takes the mother</b> bird <b>with</b> her <b>fledglings,</b> thereby violating the Torah prohibition: “You shall not take the mother with her fledglings; you shall send the mother, and the fledglings you may take for yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:6–7), <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He is flogged</b> for taking the mother bird, <b>and does not send</b> the mother, <b>and the Rabbis say: He sends</b> the mother <b>and is not flogged,</b> as <b>this is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any prohibition that entails</b> a command to <b>arise</b> and <b>perform</b> a mitzva, <b>he is not liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for its</b> violation.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a priest who eats first fruits before the one who brought the fruits to the Temple recited the accompanying Torah verses is liable to receive lashes. With regard to this statement, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> whose statements are often cited in the mishna <b>unattributed. But the Rabbis say:</b> With regard to <b>first fruits,</b> the lack of <b>placement</b> alongside the altar <b>invalidates them,</b> and they may not be eaten; but the lack of <b>recitation</b> of the accompanying Torah verses <b>does not invalidate them,</b> and if one placed them and did not recite the accompanying Torah verses, the priest who eats them is not flogged.",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say: This</b> statement in the mishna is <b>the unattributed statement of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who stated this <i>halakha</i> explicitly, rather than attributing the statement to Rabbi Akiva, whose statement was not explicit. The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that</b> although he did not say so explicitly, <b>Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>",
    "<b>What</b> is the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to food items that may not be eaten outside the walls of Jerusalem. It is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows that you vow, nor your gift offerings, nor the donation of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17). The Sages explain that with regard to the phrase <b>“nor the donation of [<i>terumat</i>] your hand,” these are first fruits.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Shimon said: What does</b> this phrase <b>come to teach us? If</b> it is to teach the prohibition <b>to eat</b> the first fruits <b>outside the wall</b> of Jerusalem, there is no need for a verse, as it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from the lenient</b> case of second-<b>tithe</b> produce. <b>If</b> with regard to <b>the lenient</b> case of second-<b>tithe</b> produce, one who <b>eats them outside the wall is flogged,</b> then with regard to <b>first fruits, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that he is flogged? Rather, <b>the verse comes to teach only with regard to</b> a priest <b>who partakes of first fruits before</b> the person who brought the fruits to the Temple <b>recited</b> the accompanying Torah verses <b>over them,</b> teaching <b>that he is flogged.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Nor your gift offerings”; this is a thanks-offering and a peace-offering</b> that one donates voluntarily. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: What does</b> this phrase <b>come to teach us? If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited <b>to eat</b> a thanks-offering and a peace-offering <b>outside the wall</b> of Jerusalem, there is no need for a verse, as it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of second-<b>tithe</b> produce, for whose consumption outside the wall one is flogged, despite the fact that it is not an offering. Rather, <b>the verse comes to teach only with regard to one who partakes of a thanks-offering or of a peace-offering before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of its blood on the altar, before the consumption of its flesh is permitted, <b>that he is flogged.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Or the firstborn”; this is the firstborn. Rabbi Shimon says: What does</b> this verse <b>come to teach us? If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited <b>to eat</b> a firstborn animal <b>outside the wall</b> of Jerusalem, there is no need for a verse, as it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of second-<b>tithe</b> produce. <b>If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited to eat a firstborn animal <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a thanks-offering and a peace-offering,</b> which are offerings of lesser sanctity, as even non-priests may partake of their flesh. Rather, <b>the verse comes to teach only with regard to</b> a non-priest <b>who partakes</b> of the flesh <b>of a firstborn even after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of its blood, <b>that he is flogged.</b>",
    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Of your herd or of your flock”; this is a sin-offering and a guilt-offering,</b> which are offerings of the most sacred order, which may be eaten only within the Temple courtyard. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: What does</b> this verse <b>come to teach us?</b>",
    "<b>If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited <b>to eat</b> a sin-offering and a guilt-offering <b>outside the wall,</b> there is no need for a verse, as it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of second-<b>tithe</b> produce. <b>If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited to eat a sin-offering and a guilt-offering <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a thanks-offering and a peace-offering,</b> which are offerings of lesser sanctity. <b>If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited for a non-priest to eat a sin-offering and a guilt-offering <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of its blood, it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a firstborn</b> animal.

    "The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Your vows”; this is the burnt-offering,</b> which is an offering of the most sacred order and is entirely consumed upon the altar, and is brought as a gift offering, not as an obligation. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: What does</b> this verse <b>come to teach us?</b>",
    "<b>If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited <b>to eat</b> a burnt-offering <b>outside the wall</b> of Jerusalem, there is no need for a verse, as it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of second-<b>tithe</b> produce. <b>If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited to eat a burnt-offering <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a thanks-offering and a peace-offering,</b> which are offerings of lesser sanctity. <b>If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited for a non-priest to eat a sin-offering and a guilt-offering <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of its blood, it may be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of <b>a firstborn</b> animal. <b>If</b> it is to teach that it is prohibited to eat a burnt-offering <b>outside the curtains</b> surrounding the Tabernacle courtyard or outside the Temple courtyard there is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from a sin-offering and a guilt-offering.</b> Rather, <b>the verse comes</b>"
