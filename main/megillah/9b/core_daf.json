    "Instead of Moses’ assertion: “I have not taken one donkey [<i>ḥamor</i>] from them” (Numbers 16:15), they wrote in more general terms: <b>“I have not taken one item of value [<i>ḥemed</i>] from them,”</b> to prevent the impression that Moses took other items. To the verse that discusses the worship of the sun and the moon, about which it is written: “Which the Lord your God has allotted to all the nations” (Deuteronomy 4:19), they added a word to make it read: <b>“Which the Lord your God has allotted to give light to all the nations,”</b> to prevent the potential misinterpretation that the heavenly bodies were given to the gentiles so that they may worship them.",
    "The verse: <b>“And has gone and served other gods,</b> and worshipped them, either the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, <b>which I have not commanded”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:3), could be understood as indicating that God did not command their existence, i.e., these entities created themselves. Therefore, when these Elders translated the verse they added a word to the end of the verse to make it read: Which I have not commanded <b>to serve them.</b>",
    "<b>And</b> in the list of unclean animals <b>they wrote for him: The short-legged beast [<i>tze’irat haraglayim</i>]. And they did not write for him: “And the hare [<i>arnevet</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 11:6), <b>since the name of Ptolemy’s wife</b> was <b>Arnevet, so that he would not say: The Jews have mocked me and inserted my wife’s name in the Torah.</b> Therefore, they did not refer to the hare by name, but by one of its characteristic features.",
    "The mishna cites that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Even with regard to</b> Torah <b>scrolls,</b> the Sages <b>permitted them to be written only</b> in <b>Greek. Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?</b> He based his opinion on an allusion in the Torah, as the <b>verse states: “God shall enlarge Japheth, and He shall dwell in the tents of Shem”</b> (Genesis 9:27), indicating that <b>the words of Japheth shall be in the tents of Shem.</b> The language of Javan, who is the forbear of the Greek nation and one of the descendants of Japheth, will also serve as a sacred language in the tents of Shem, where Torah is studied.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And say</b> that it is the languages of <b>Gomer and Magog</b> that serve as sacred languages, as they too were descendants of Japheth (see Genesis 10:2). The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: This is the reason, as it is written: “God shall enlarge [<i>yaft</i>] Japheth [<i>Yefet</i>].”</b> <i>Yaft</i> is etymologically similar to the Hebrew term for beauty [<i>yofi</i>]. The verse teaches that <b>the beauty of Japheth shall be in the tents of Shem,</b> and Greek is the most beautiful of the languages of the descendants of Japheth.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between a</b> High <b>Priest anointed with the oil of anointing,</b> which was the method through which High Priests were consecrated until the oil was sequestered toward the end of the First Temple period, <b>and</b> one consecrated by donning <b>multiple garments</b> unique to the High Priest, which was the practice during the Second Temple period, <b>is only</b> that the latter does not bring the <b>bull that comes for</b> transgression of <b>any of the mitzvot.</b> An anointed High Priest who unwittingly issued an erroneous halakhic ruling and acted upon that ruling, and transgressed a mitzva whose unwitting violation renders one liable to bring a sin-offering, is obligated to bring a sin-offering unique to one in his position.",
    "<b>The difference between a</b> High <b>Priest</b> currently <b>serving</b> in that capacity <b>and a former</b> High <b>Priest,</b> who temporarily filled that position when the High Priest was unfit for service, <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>the bull</b> brought by the High Priest on <b>Yom Kippur, and the tenth of an ephah</b> meal-offering brought daily by the High Priest. Each of these offerings is brought only by the current High Priest, and not by a former High Priest.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers <b>that</b> with regard <b>to the matter of the bull</b> brought by the High Priest on <b>Yom Kippur, and</b> with regard to <b>the tenth of an ephah</b> meal-offering, both <b>this,</b> the anointed High Priest, <b>and that,</b> the High Priest consecrated by donning multiple garments, are <b>equal.</b>",
    "The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as if it</b> were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> it would be difficult. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A High Priest consecrated by donning the <b>multiple garments</b> unique to the High Priest <b>brings the bull brought for</b> the unwitting violation of <b>any of the mitzvot;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: He does not bring</b> that offering.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that it is written: “If the anointed priest shall sin” (Leviticus 4:3). From the word <b>anointed, I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies to a High Priest who was actually <b>anointed with the oil of anointing. From where</b> do I derive that even a High Priest consecrated by donning the <b>multiple garments</b> is also included in this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The verse states: “The anointed,”</b> with the definite article, indicating that the <i>halakha</i> applies to every High Priest.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>How did we establish</b> the mishna? We established <b>that</b> it is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>The difference between a</b> High <b>Priest</b> currently <b>serving</b> in that capacity <b>and a former</b> High <b>Priest is only</b> with regard to <b>the bull</b> brought <b>on Yom Kippur, and the tenth of an ephah</b> meal-offering. The Gemara infers <b>that</b> with regard <b>to all</b> other <b>matters,</b> both <b>this,</b> a High Priest currently serving, <b>and that,</b> a former High Priest, are <b>equal.</b> If so <b>we have arrived at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If temporary <b>disqualification befell</b> the High Priest, <b>and they appointed another priest in his stead,</b> then after the cause of disqualification of <b>the first</b> priest passes, he <b>returns to his service</b> as High Priest. With regard to <b>the second</b> priest, <b>all of the mitzvot of the High Priest</b> are incumbent <b>upon him;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yosei says: The first returns to his service; the second is fit</b> to serve <b>neither as a High Priest nor as a common priest.</b>",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yosei said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving</b> the priest <b>Rabbi Yosef ben Elem of Tzippori,</b> who, <b>when disqualification befell a High Priest,</b> the priests <b>appointed him in his stead. And</b> after the cause of the disqualification was resolved, <b>the incident came before the Sages</b> for a ruling with regard to the status of Rabbi Yosef ben Elem. <b>And</b> the Sages <b>said:</b> The <b>original</b> High Priest <b>returns to his service,</b> while the <b>second is fit</b> to serve <b>neither as High Priest nor as a common priest.</b>",
    "The Gemara explains: Neither as a <b>High Priest, due to hatred,</b> jealousy, and bitterness that would arise if there were two High Priests with equal standing in the Temple; nor as a <b>common priest, because</b> the principle is: <b>One elevates</b> to a higher level <b>in</b> matters of <b>sanctity and one does not downgrade.</b> Once he has served as a High Priest he cannot be restored to the position of a common priest. Is that to say that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Meir, <b>and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ḥisda said: Indeed, the first clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. Rav Yosef said:</b> The entire mishna <b>is</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he formulates it according to</b> the opinions <b>of</b> different <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> that is to say, resulting in a third opinion, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis with regard to a High Priest consecrated by donning multiple garments, and the opinion of Rabbi Meir with regard to a former High Priest.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between a great,</b> public <b>altar,</b> such as the altars established at Nob and Gibeon, which served as religious centers following the destruction of the Tabernacle in Shiloh, <b>and a small,</b> personal <b>altar</b> on which individuals would sacrifice their offerings, <b>is only</b> with regard to <b>Paschal lambs,</b> which may not be sacrificed on a small altar. <b>This is the principle: Any</b> offering <b>that is vowed or contributed</b> voluntarily <b>is sacrificed on a</b> small <b>altar, and any</b> offering <b>that is neither vowed nor contributed</b> voluntarily, but rather is compulsory, e.g., a sin-offering, <b>is not sacrificed on a</b> small <b>altar.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Is the difference only <b>Paschal lambs and nothing more?</b> The continuation of the mishna indicates that there are additional differences. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the difference between them is only with regard to offerings that are <b>similar to Paschal lambs.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: According to <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna taught? The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even the public sacrificed only Paschal lambs and compulsory</b> offerings <b>for which there is a set time,</b> like fixed communal offerings. <b>However, compulsory</b> offerings <b>for which there is not a set time,</b> e.g., sin-offerings brought for an unwitting transgression committed by the community, <b>are sacrificed neither here</b> on a small altar <b>nor here</b> on a great altar; they are sacrificed only in the Temple.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The difference between</b> the Tabernacle in <b>Shilo and</b> the Temple in <b>Jerusalem is only that in Shiloh one eats offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> e.g., individual peace-offerings, thanks-offerings, and the Paschal lamb, <b>and</b> also <b>the second tithe, in any place that overlooks</b> Shiloh, as Shiloh was not a walled city and any place within its Shabbat boundary was regarded as part of the city. <b>And in Jerusalem</b> one eats those consecrated items only <b>within the walls.</b>",
    "<b>And here,</b> in Shiloh, <b>and there,</b> in Jerusalem, <b>offerings of the most sacred order are eaten</b> only <b>within the hangings.</b> The Tabernacle courtyard in Shiloh was surrounded by hangings and the Temple courtyard in Jerusalem was surrounded by a wall. There is another difference: With regard to <b>the sanctity of Shiloh,</b>"
