    "<b>Why were the years of Ishmael mentioned</b> in the Torah? For what purpose were we told the life span of that wicked man? <b>In order to reckon through them the years of Jacob. As it is written: “And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty-seven years”</b> (Genesis 25:17). <b>How much older was Ishmael than Isaac? Fourteen years. As it is written: “And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram”</b> (Genesis 16:16). <b>And it is written: “And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him”</b> (Genesis 21:5). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to Jacob and Esau: <b>“And Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them”</b> (Genesis 25:26). Based on these verses, <b>how old was Ishmael when Jacob was born? Seventy-four. How many of his years remained</b> then until his death? <b>Sixty-three,</b> as Ishmael died at the age of a hundred and thirty-seven.",
    "<b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Jacob our father was sixty-three years old at the time he was blessed by his father, and at that same time Ishmael died.</b> How is it known that these two events occurred at the same time? <b>As it is written: “When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed</b> Jacob…<b>then Esau went to Ishmael and took for a wife Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael,</b> Abraham’s son, <b>the sister of Nebaioth”</b> (Genesis 28:6–9). <b>From the fact that</b> it <b>is stated: “the daughter of Ishmael,” do I not know that she was the sister of Nebaioth?</b> For what purpose then does the verse say this explicitly? <b>This teaches that Ishmael betrothed her</b> to Esau <b>and</b> in the meantime he <b>died, and Nebaioth her brother married her off.</b> Therefore, special mention is made of Nebaioth. Consequently, it is understood that Jacob was sixty-three years old when he received his blessing and left his father’s house.",
    "If we calculate these <b>sixty-three</b> years <b>and</b> the <b>fourteen until Joseph was born, this</b> means that Jacob should have been <b>seventy-seven</b> at the time of Joseph’s birth. <b>And it is written: “And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh”</b> (Genesis 41:46). <b>This</b> indicates that Jacob should have then been at least <b>a hundred and seven</b> years old when Joseph was thirty. Add the <b>seven</b> years <b>of plenty and</b> the <b>two of famine,</b> and <b>this</b> would then indicate that Jacob should have been <b>a hundred and sixteen</b> years old when he arrived in Egypt in the second year of the famine.",
    "<b>But it is written: “And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life? And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my sojournings are a hundred and thirty years”</b> (Genesis 47:8–9). Jacob indicated that he was a hundred and thirty when he arrived in Egypt, <b>which is</b> different from the <b>hundred and sixteen</b> years calculated previously. Where are the missing fourteen years from Jacob’s lifetime?",
    "<b>Rather, learn from here</b> that the fourteen years that Jacob spent in the house of Eber are not counted here. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Jacob was</b> studying <b>in the house of Eber for fourteen years</b> while <b>in hiding</b> from his brother Esau. If we were to calculate the life spans recorded in the Torah, we would find that <b>Eber died</b> when Jacob was seventy-nine years old, <b>two years after Jacob our father went down to Aram-naharaim,</b> to the house of Laban. When Jacob <b>left</b> after completing his studying <b>there,</b> he <b>then went</b> immediately <b>to Aram-naharaim.</b> Therefore, <b>when</b> Jacob <b>stood at the well</b> upon his arrival in Aram-naharaim, <b>he was seventy-seven years old.</b>",
    "<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> Jacob <b>was not punished</b> for the fourteen years that he was in the house of Eber, during which time he failed to fulfill the mitzva of honoring one’s parents? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It turns out that Joseph was away from his father for twenty-two years, just as Jacob our father was away from his</b> own <b>father</b> for that same period of time. According to the previous calculation, however, the <i>baraita</i> is difficult, as <b>Jacob</b> was absent for <b>thirty-six</b> years. Rather, conclude from here that <b>the fourteen</b> years <b>that he was in the house of Eber are not counted,</b> as he was not punished for them.",
    "The Gemara raises an objection: But <b>ultimately,</b> Jacob was in <b>Laban’s house for</b> only <b>twenty years.</b> Why, then, is he faulted for being away from his father for twenty-two years? <b>Rather,</b> he was punished <b>because on his journey</b> back from Aram-naharaim <b>he tarried</b> another <b>two years</b> before returning home to his parents, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Jacob <b>left Aram-naharaim and came to Sukkot, and spent eighteen months there, as it is stated: “And Jacob journeyed to Sukkot, built himself a house, and made booths [<i>sukkot</i>] for his cattle”</b> (Genesis 33:17). The Gemara understands this verse to mean that first he made booths [<i>Sukkot</i>], to live in during the summer, and then he built a house in the winter, and afterward he again made booths [<i>sukkot</i>] during the next summer, indicating that he must have been there for eighteen months. <b>He then was in Bethel for six months, and he brought offerings,</b> totaling two years in all. In this way, all the various calculations of years are reconciled.",
    "May we return to you Chapter “The Megillah is Read”",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who reads the Megilla out of order,</b> reading a later section first, and then going back to the earlier section, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. If <b>he read it by heart,</b> or <b>if he read it in</b> Aramaic <b>translation</b> or <b>in any</b> other <b>language</b> that he does not understand, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. <b>However, for those who speak a foreign language, one may read</b> the Megilla <b>in</b> that <b>foreign language. And one who speaks a foreign language who heard</b> the Megilla read in <b><i>Ashurit</i>,</b> i.e., in Hebrew, <b>has fulfilled</b> his obligation.",
    "<b>If one read</b> the Megilla <b>at intervals,</b> pausing and resuming, <b>or</b> while <b>he is dozing off, he has fulfilled his obligation. If one was writing</b> a Megilla, <b>or expounding upon it, or correcting it,</b> and he read all its words as he was doing so, the following distinction applies: <b>If he had intent</b> to fulfill his obligation with that reading <b>he has fulfilled his obligation, but if not, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.",
    "<b>If</b> one reads from a Megilla that <b>was written</b> not with ink but <b>with <i>sam</i> or with <i>sikra</i> or with <i>komos</i> or with <i>kankantom</i>,</b> or from a Megilla that was written not on parchment but <b>on <i>neyar</i> or on <i>diftera</i>,</b> a kind of unprocessed leather, <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation. He does not fulfill his obligation <b>unless</b> he reads from a Megilla that <b>is written in <i>Ashurit</i>,</b> i.e., in the Hebrew language and using the Hebrew script, <b>upon parchment and with ink.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was taught in the mishna that one who reads the Megilla out of order has not fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rava said: The verse states</b> concerning Purim: “That they should unfailingly observe these two days <b>according to their writing, and according to their appointed times</b> every year” (Esther 9:27), and the word “times” is referring to the two days of Purim, the fourteenth and the fifteenth of Adar. And we learn by way of analogy: <b>Just as their appointed times cannot be out of order,</b> as the fifteenth of Adar cannot possibly come before the fourteenth, <b>so too, their writing must not be out of order.</b>",
    "The Gemara rejects this derivation: <b>Is reading written here at all?</b> It is “<b>observing”</b> that <b>is written</b> here in this verse, not reading, <b>as it is written: “That they should unfailingly observe these two days</b> according to their writing, and according to their appointed times.” <b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from here, as it is written: “And that these days should be remembered and observed</b> throughout every generation” (Esther 9:28). <b>Remembering is juxtaposed to observing,</b> indicating: <b>Just as observing cannot be out of order,</b> as was derived from the words “That they should unfailingly observe these two days according to their writing, and according to their appointed times,” <b>so too, remembering,</b> by reading the Megilla, <b>may not be out of order.</b>",
    "§ The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <i>halakha</i> of not reading out of order applies <b>also to <i>hallel</i>, and also to the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, and</b> also <b>to</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer,</b> meaning that to fulfill one’s obligation he must recite the text of each of these in order.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b><i>hallel</i></b> may not be recited out of order? <b>Rabba said: As it is written</b> in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“From the rising of the sun until its setting</b> the Lord’s name is to be praised” (Psalms 113:3). Just as the sunrise and sunset cannot be reversed, so too, <i>hallel</i> may not be recited out of order. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is derived from the verse in <i>hallel</i> that states: <b>“This is the day that the Lord has made”</b> (Psalms 118:24); just as the day follows a certain order, so too, <i>hallel</i> must be recited in its proper order.",
    "<b>Rav Avya said:</b> It is derived from the verse in <i>hallel</i>: <b>“Blessed be the name of the Lord”</b> (Psalms 113:2), indicating that the blessing of God must “be” just as it is written. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> who said: It is derived from <b>here,</b> the end of the aforementioned verse: <b>“From now and for evermore”</b> (Psalms 113:2), i.e., it should be like time, which cannot be reversed.",
    "From where do we know one has not fulfilled his obligation of <b>reciting the <i>Shema</i></b> if he recited it out of order? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The recital of the <i>Shema</i> must be as it is written,</b> i.e., in Hebrew; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> It may be recited <b>in any language.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>The verse states:</b>"
