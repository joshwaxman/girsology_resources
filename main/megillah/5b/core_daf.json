    "<b>And he bathed</b> at the time when the <b>wagons [<i>kerona</i>]</b> were traveling through <b>Tzippori,</b> i.e., on the market day, when the public would know about it, <b>on the seventeenth of Tammuz,</b> to show that bathing is permitted on that day. <b>And he sought to abolish</b> the fast of <b>the Ninth of Av. And</b> with respect to the Ninth of Av, the Sages <b>did not agree with him.</b>",
    "<b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>My teacher, the incident did not</b> occur in <b>this</b> fashion. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi never sought to abolish the fast of the Ninth of Av. <b>Rather, it was</b> a year when <b>the Ninth of Av occurred on Shabbat, and they postponed it until after Shabbat. And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> about that case: <b>Since it has</b> already <b>been deferred</b> from its usual time, <b>let it be</b> altogether <b>deferred</b> this year. <b>And the Rabbis did not agree with him.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>read</b> the verse <b>about</b> Rabbi Abba bar Zavda: <b>“Two are better than one”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:9), meaning, it is good that you were here to provide an accurate report about that incident.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> could <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>plant a sapling on Purim? Didn’t Rav Yosef teach</b> with regard to the verse: “Therefore the Jews of the villages, who dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month of Adar a day of <b>gladness and feasting, and a good day [<i>yom tov</i>]”</b> (Esther 9:19), that the term <b>“gladness” teaches that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>eulogize</b> on Purim; <b>“feasting” teaches that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>fast; and</b> the term <b>“good day” [<i>yom tov</i>] teaches that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>perform labor,</b> just as on a Festival, which is also referred to as a <i>yom tov</i>? <b>Rather,</b> what happened was as follows: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi was in a place that observed Purim <b>on the fourteenth, and when he planted</b> the sapling, <b>he planted</b> it <b>on the fifteenth.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Wasn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>in Tiberias, and Tiberias was surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun.</b> Consequently, he was obligated to observe Purim on the fifteenth. <b>Rather,</b> say just the opposite: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi lived in a place that observed Purim <b>on the fifteenth, and when he planted</b> the sapling, <b>he planted</b> it <b>on the fourteenth.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Was it obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>that</b> the city of <b>Tiberias was surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun? Didn’t Hezekiah read</b> the Megilla <b>in Tiberias</b> both <b>on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth</b> of Adar, because <b>he was uncertain if</b> it had been <b>surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, or not?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Hezekiah was</b> indeed <b>uncertain</b> about the matter, whereas <b>it was obvious to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that Tiberias had been surrounded by a wall in the time of Joshua.",
    "The Gemara asks further: <b>And when it was obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi that the Megilla should be read in Tiberias on the fifteenth, <b>was it permitted</b> to plant there on the fourteenth? <b>Isn’t it written in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i></b> that <b>the fourteenth day and the fifteenth day of Adar are the days of Purim,</b> and <b>one is not</b> permitted <b>to eulogize on them?</b>",
    "<b>And Rava said:</b> This statement <b>is necessary only to prohibit</b> those who observe Purim <b>on this</b> day to eulogize <b>on that</b> day, <b>and</b> those who observe Purim <b>on that</b> day to eulogize <b>on this</b> day. Since the two days are mentioned in the Bible, it was only necessary to mention them in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i> in order to indicate that the prohibition against eulogizing applies to both days. Presumably, the same should apply to the prohibition against performing labor. Consequently, how could Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi plant a sapling on the fourteenth of Adar? The Gemara answers: <b>That applies</b> only to <b>eulogies and fasting. However, labor</b> is prohibited for only <b>one day,</b> either the fourteenth or the fifteenth, <b>and no more.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? Didn’t Rav see a certain man planting flax on Purim, and cursed him, and</b> the man’s <b>flax never grew.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the man <b>was</b> obligated to observe Purim <b>on that day</b> that he planted the flax. Therefore, it was certainly prohibited to perform labor.",
    "<b>Rabba, son of Rava, said</b> a different answer to the question: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi planted the sapling <b>on his</b> own <b>day</b> of Purim, i.e., on the day that the Megilla was read in his location, it was still permitted to plant the sapling. This is because the Jewish people <b>accepted upon themselves</b> the prohibitions against <b>eulogizing and fasting</b> on Purim, but <b>they did not accept upon themselves the prohibition</b> against performing <b>labor.</b>",
    "This can be proven from the fact <b>that initially,</b> when Mordecai and Esther proposed the celebration of Purim, <b>it is written:</b> “A day of <b>gladness and feasting and a good day [<i>yom tov</i>]”</b> (Esther 9:19), <b>and at the end,</b> when the celebration of Purim was accepted by the Jewish people, <b>it is written:</b> “That they should <b>make them days of feasting and gladness”</b> (Esther 9:22), <b>whereas</b> the term <b>good day [<i>yom tov</i>],</b> which alludes to a day when it is prohibited to perform labor, <b>is not written.</b> The people never accepted upon themselves the prohibition against performing labor on Purim as if it were a Festival, and therefore the prohibition never took effect.",
    "The Gemara asks: If labor is permitted on Purim, <b>what is the reason that Rav cursed that man</b> who planted the flax? The Gemara answers: <b>It was</b> a case of <b>matters that are permitted</b> by <i>halakha</i>, <b>but others were accustomed to</b> treat <b>them as a prohibition,</b> in which case one may not permit these actions in their presence, lest they come to treat other prohibitions lightly. In the place where that man planted his flax, it was customary to abstain from labor on Purim. However, <b>in Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>place, it was not the custom</b> to abstain from labor on Purim, and therefore it was permitted for him to plant the sapling even in public.",
    "<b>And if you wish, say</b> an alternative answer: <b>Actually, it was the custom</b> to abstain from labor on Purim in Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s place, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi engaged in a <b>joyful</b> act of <b>planting,</b> for pleasure rather than for financial benefit. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to public fasts: If <b>these</b> fasts for rain <b>have passed and</b> the community’s prayers <b>have</b> still <b>not been answered,</b> and the drought continues, <b>one decreases his business</b> activities, as well as <b>construction, planting, betrothals, and marriages.</b>",
    "<b>And it was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>about this</b> mishna: When the Sages said that <b>construction</b> must be decreased on public fasts, they were not referring to the construction of homes for people who have nowhere to live, but to <b>joyful construction.</b> Similarly, when they said that <b>planting</b> must be decreased, they were not referring to planting food crops, but to <b>joyful planting. What is</b> meant by <b>joyful construction? This</b> is referring to <b>one who builds a wedding chamber for his son.</b> It was customary to build a special house where the wedding would take place, and at times the couple would also live there. <b>What is</b> meant by <b>joyful planting? This</b> is referring to <b>one who plants</b> trees for shade and pleasure such as one might find in <b>a royal garden</b> [<b><i>avurneki</i></b>]. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi engaged in joyful planting on Purim, in keeping with the joyous nature of the day.",
    "§ The Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the previous discussion. <b>Hezekiah read</b> the Megilla <b>in Tiberias</b> both <b>on the fourteenth and on the fifteenth</b> of Adar, because <b>he was uncertain if it</b> had been <b>surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, or not.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Was he</b> really <b>uncertain about the matter of Tiberias? Isn’t it written: “And the fortified cities were Ziddim-zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth”</b> (Joshua 19:35)<b>, and we maintain</b> that <b>Rakkath is Tiberias?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is the reason that he was uncertain:</b> Although Tiberias was surrounded by a wall in the time of Joshua, Hezekiah was uncertain about the <i>halakha</i> <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> on <b>one side, there was a wall of the sea,</b> i.e., there was no physical wall, but the city was protected due to the fact that it adjoined the sea.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why was he uncertain?</b> The sea is <b>certainly not a wall. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the sale of houses in walled cities, the phrase: <b>“Which has a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30), indicates that the city has a bona fide wall <b>and not</b> merely <b>a wall of roofs.</b> If a city is completely encircled by attached houses but there is no separate wall, it is not considered a walled city. The next verse, which is referring to cities that have no wall <b>“round about</b> them” (Leviticus 25:31), <b>excludes Tiberias</b> from being considered a walled city, <b>as the sea is its wall</b> on one side and it is not fully encircled by a physical wall. Consequently, Tiberias is not considered a walled city.",
    "The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to</b> the sale of <b>houses of walled cities,</b> Hezekiah <b>was not uncertain. Where he was uncertain was with regard to the reading of the Megilla: What are the unwalled towns and what are the walled cities that are written with regard to the reading of the Megilla?</b> Is the difference between them <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that these</b> unwalled towns <b>are exposed, whereas those</b> walled cities <b>are not exposed?</b> If so, since Tiberias <b>is also exposed,</b> as it is not entirely surrounded by a wall, it should be considered unwalled. <b>Or perhaps</b> the difference is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that these</b> walled cities <b>are protected, whereas those</b> unwalled towns <b>are not protected, and</b> Tiberias <b>is also protected</b> by the sea and should be treated as a walled city. It was <b>due to that</b> reason that Hezekiah <b>was uncertain</b> when to read the Megilla.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Asi read the Megilla in</b> the city of <b>Huzal</b> in Babylonia on both <b>the fourteenth and the fifteenth</b> of Adar, because <b>he was uncertain if</b> it had been <b>surrounded</b> by a wall <b>since the days of Joshua, son of Nun, or not.</b> Huzal was an ancient city, and it was possible that it had been surrounded by a wall in the time of Joshua. <b>Some say</b> a different version of this report, according to which there was no uncertainty. <b>Rav Asi said: This</b> city of <b>Huzal of the house of Benjamin was walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun.</b>",
    "Incidental to the previous discussion concerning Tiberias, the Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When I was a child I said something that I</b> later <b>asked the Elders</b> about,"
