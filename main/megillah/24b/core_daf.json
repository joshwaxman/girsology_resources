    "<b>Here, also,</b> according to Rabba bar Shimi, <b>it is</b> to prevent <b>his father or teacher</b> from <b>quarreling.</b>",
    "§ We learned in the mishna: <b>One whose limbs are exposed [<i>poḥe’aḥ</i>] may recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i></b> and translate the Torah reading into Aramaic, but he may not read from the Torah. <b>Ulla bar Rav raised a dilemma before Abaye: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>a minor whose limbs are exposed</b> may <b>read from the Torah?</b> Can it be argued that a minor’s bare limbs do not fall under the category of nakedness, and therefore it is permitted for him to read the Torah despite the fact that parts of his body are exposed?",
    "Abaye <b>said to him: And</b> according to this reasoning, <b>raise the dilemma</b> with regard to a minor who is totally <b>naked. What is the reason that</b> a minor who is <b>naked may not</b> read the Torah? It is <b>due to respect for the public. Here, too,</b> a <i>poḥe’aḥ</i> may not read from the Torah <b>due to respect for the public.</b>",
    "The mishna continues: One who is <b>blind may recite the</b> introductory prayers and <b>blessing</b> before <b><i>Shema</i>,</b> and he may also translate the Torah reading into Aramaic. Rabbi Yehuda says: Anyone who has not seen the luminaries in his life may not recite the first of the blessings before <i>Shema</i>, which is the blessing over the luminaries. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>they said to Rabbi Yehuda: Many have seen</b> enough with their mind <b>to expound upon the</b> Divine <b>Chariot, although they have never</b> actually <b>seen it.</b> Similarly, even one who has never seen the luminaries may recite the blessing.",
    "<b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> counter this argument? He can say that <b>there,</b> with regard to the Chariot, <b>the matter depends upon the heart’s comprehension, and one can concentrate</b> his mind <b>and understand</b> the Chariot even if he has never actually seen it. But <b>here,</b> with regard to the luminaries, the blessing is recited <b>due to the benefit</b> one derives from them, <b>and</b> one who is blind <b>does not derive</b> any <b>benefit</b> from them, and therefore he may not recite a blessing over them.",
    "<b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain that even a blind man <b>derives benefit</b> from the luminaries, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: All of my life I was troubled by this verse,</b> which I did not understand: <b>“And you shall grope at noon as the blind man gropes in the darkness”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:29). I was perplexed: <b>What</b> does it <b>matter to a blind</b> person <b>whether</b> it is <b>dark or light?</b> He cannot see in any event, so why does the verse speak about a blind man in the darkness?",
    "I continued to ponder the matter <b>until</b> the following <b>incident occurred to me. I was once walking in the absolute darkness of the night, and I saw a blind man who was walking on</b> his <b>way with a torch in his hands. I said to him: My son, why do you</b> need <b>this torch</b> if you are blind? <b>He said to me: As long as I have a torch in my hand, people see me and save me from the pits and the thorns and the thistles.</b> Even a blind man derives at least indirect benefit from the light, and therefore he may recite the blessing over the heavenly luminaries.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A priest who has blemishes on his hands may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. Because of his blemish, people will look at his hands, and it is prohibited to look at the hands of the priests during the Priestly Benediction. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one whose hands were colored with <i>satis</i>,</b> a blue dye, <b>may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction <b>because the congregation will look at him.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The blemishes that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> disqualify a priest from reciting the Priestly Benediction include any blemishes found <b>on his face, hands, and feet,</b> but not blemishes that are not visible to others. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> If <b>his hands are spotted</b> with white blotches, <b>he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a priest’s <b>hands are spotted, he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. Similarly, if his hands are <b>curved</b> inward <b>or bent</b> sideways, <b>he may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction.",
    "Apropos the previous discussion, <b>Rav Asi said:</b> A priest <b>from Haifa or Beit She’an may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction, as he does not know how to properly pronounce the guttural letters. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not allow the people of Beit She’an, nor the people of Beit Haifa, nor the people of Tivonin to pass before the ark</b> in order to lead the service <b>because they pronounce <i>alef</i> as <i>ayin</i> and <i>ayin</i> as <i>alef</i>,</b> and they thereby distort the meaning of the prayers.",
    "The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> once <b>said to Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>If you were a Levite, you would be disqualified from</b> singing on <b>the platform</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>because your voice is thick.</b> Offended by this remark, Rabbi Shimon <b>went and told his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, what Rabbi Ḥiyya had said. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>say to him: When you</b> study and <b>reach</b> the verse: <b>“And I will wait upon [<i>veḥikkiti</i>] the Lord”</b> (Isaiah 8:17), <b>will you not be a maligner and a blasphemer?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, who was from Babylonia, was unable to differentiate between the letters <i>ḥet</i> and <i>heh</i>, and he would therefore pronounce the word <i>veḥikkiti</i> as <i>vehikkiti</i>, which means: And I will strike.",
    "<b>Rav Huna said:</b> A priest <b>whose eyes</b> constantly <b>run</b> with tears <b>may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t there a certain</b> priest with this condition <b>in the neighborhood of Rav Huna, and he would spread his hands</b> and recite the Priestly Benediction? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> priest <b>was a familiar</b> figure <b>in his town.</b> Since the other residents were accustomed to seeing him, he would not draw their attention during the Priestly Benediction. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One whose eyes run should not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction, <b>but if he is a familiar</b> figure <b>in his town, he is permitted</b> to do so.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who is blind in one eye may not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction because people will gaze at him. The Gemara asks: <b>Wasn’t there a certain</b> priest who was blind in one eye <b>in the neighborhood of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and he would lift his hands</b> and recite the Priestly Benediction? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> priest <b>was a familiar</b> figure <b>in his town,</b> and therefore he would not attract attention during the Priestly Benediction. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is blind in one eye may not lift his hands</b> and recite the Priestly Benediction, <b>but if he is a familiar</b> figure <b>in his town, he is permitted</b> to do so.",
    "We learned in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: One whose hands are colored should not lift his hands</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If most of the townspeople are engaged in this occupation,</b> dyeing, <b>he is permitted</b> to recite the Priestly Benediction, as the congregation will not pay attention to his stained hands.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says: I will not pass before the ark</b> to lead the prayer service <b>in colored</b> garments, <b>may not pass</b> before the ark to lead the prayer service <b>even in white</b> garments. There is concern that one who insists on wearing clothing of a specific color during his prayers is a heretic and therefore unfit to lead the service. Similarly, if one says: <b>I will not pass</b> before the ark <b>wearing sandals, he may not pass</b> before it <b>even barefoot,</b> as he is not acting in accordance with the teachings of the Sages.",
    "<b>One who constructs his phylacteries</b> in <b>a round</b> shape exposes himself to <b>danger</b> during times of persecution, when foreign governments impose a ban on the mitzva of phylacteries, <b>and</b> yet he does <b>not</b> fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> to don phylacteries, as phylacteries must be square. <b>If one placed</b> the phylacteries worn on the head <b>on his forehead,</b> and not in its proper place above his hairline, <b>or</b> if he placed the phylacteries worn on the arm <b>on his palm,</b> and not on his biceps, <b>this is the way of the heretics,</b> i.e., those who reject the tradition of the Sages with regard to the proper placement of the phylacteries. If <b>one plated</b> his phylacteries <b>with gold or placed</b> the phylacteries worn on the arm <b>on</b> the outside of <b>his sleeve [<i>unkeli</i>], this is the way of the outsiders,</b> i.e., those who do not take part in the traditions of the Jewish people.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> that one who wishes to pray only with white clothes or barefoot is not permitted to lead the prayer? <b>We are concerned that perhaps he has been imbued with heresy,</b> as these are the practices of idolaters. He is therefore barred from leading the service.",
    "We learned in the mishna: <b>One who constructs his phylacteries</b> in <b>a round</b> shape exposes himself to <b>danger and</b> does <b>not</b> fulfill the <b>mitzva</b> to don phylacteries. The Gemara comments: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> in this mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The requirement that <b>phylacteries</b> must be <b>square is a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai. And Rava said</b> about this: Square means <b>along their seams and their diagonals [<i>alakhsonan</i>],</b> i.e., they must be perfectly square. It would seem that all this was already stated in the mishna, which says that round phylacteries are disqualified.",
    "<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is possible to understand that <b>the mishna</b> is referring to phylacteries <b>that one constructed</b> to be round <b>like a nut,</b> i.e., in the shape of a ball. However, the mishna does not indicate that the phylacteries must be square, as it does not address the case of phylacteries that are rounded but not a true sphere.",
