    "<b>or perhaps</b> does it mean it is fed the amount of a fig-bulk <b>at each and every meal? If you say</b> that it is fed a fig-bulk only <b>at the first meal,</b> is it fed this fodder <b>before</b> its regularly scheduled <b>eating or after eating?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Before eating,</b> it is <b>certainly effective for it like a medicine,</b> which people imbibe before their meals. With regard to <b>after eating, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is this an effective manner of examining the animal? The Gemara further inquires: Is the animal fed this fodder as a medicine <b>before drinking or after drinking? Before drinking it is certainly effective for it, like barley,</b> which is fed to an animal before it drinks. With regard to <b>after drinking, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?",
    "The Gemara continues to inquire: Is the animal given the fodder when it is <b>tied or untied?</b> The Gemara explains: When it is <b>untied,</b> the fodder is <b>certainly effective for this</b> animal. When it is <b>tied, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Furthermore, is it fed the fodder when it is <b>by itself, or with another</b> animal? When it is <b>with another</b> animal, the fodder <b>is certainly effective for</b> this animal, as it is comfortable. When it is <b>by itself, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?",
    "Likewise, is the animal fed it <b>in the city or in the field?</b> When it is <b>in the field,</b> the fodder <b>is certainly effective for</b> this animal, as it is calm. When it is <b>in the city, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Ashi raises</b> a further <b>dilemma: If you say</b> that this treatment is effective only when it is <b>in the field,</b> not when it is the city, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a garden adjacent to the city?</b> No resolution is found for any of these inquiries, and with regard to each of them the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.",
    "§ The mishna teaches with regard to constant pale spots that <b>Rabbi Ḥananya ben Antigonus says:</b> One examines the animal three times within eighty days. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>provided that they are divided into</b> equal <b>thirds,</b> i.e., there must be an even gap between each of these examinations.",
    "With regard to the statement of the mishna that constant tears are examined by feeding the animal moist and then dry fodder for a period of three months, <b>Pineḥas, the brother of Mar Shmuel, raises a dilemma before Shmuel:</b> If the animal <b>ate</b> the fodder in the required manner <b>and was not healed,</b> which means that it is blemished, <b>is it a retroactive blemish</b> from the day it was discovered, <b>or is it a blemish from that point forward?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>with regard to</b> whether one has violated the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>concerning its redemption</b> money in a case where a consecrated animal was redeemed before the end of the three months of examination and someone derived benefit from the money paid for its redemption. <b>If you say</b> that <b>it is a retroactive blemish,</b> he thereby <b>misuses</b> consecrated property, as the redemption was effective and the money belongs to the Temple treasury.",
    "<b>But if it is a blemish from that point forward,</b> then one who derived benefit from money paid before that point has <b>not misused</b> consecrated property, as an unblemished animal cannot be redeemed, and the money remains non-sacred. <b>What,</b> then, is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Shmuel read</b> this verse <b>with regard to his</b> brother: <b>“The lame take the prey”</b> (Isaiah 33:23), i.e., one who is not learned in Torah has managed to ask a question for which I have no answer.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> For these additional blemishes, one may slaughter a firstborn animal outside the Temple: <b>Its nose that was pierced, or that was damaged</b> and is lacking, <b>or that was split.</b> Likewise, <b>its lip that was pierced,</b> or <b>that was damaged,</b> or <b>that was split</b> is considered a blemish.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the case of the nose that was pierced, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>its nostrils were pierced one into the other,</b> if the perforation is visible <b>on the outside</b> of the nostril, <b>this is a blemish;</b> if it is visible only <b>on the inside</b> of the nostril, <b>it is not a blemish.</b> With regard to the case of: <b>Its lip that was pierced or that was damaged or that was split, Rav Pappa says:</b> This is referring to <b>the outer row,</b> i.e., the front, protruding part <b>of its lip.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists additional blemishes that permit the slaughter of the firstborn: <b>The external gums that were damaged</b> and lacking <b>or that were scratched,</b> and likewise, <b>the internal</b> gums <b>that were extracted. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: One does not examine from the double teeth,</b> i.e., the large molars that appear like two teeth, <b>and inward, and</b> one does <b>not</b> examine <b>even the</b> place of the <b>double teeth</b> themselves. This is because even if they were extracted, it is a concealed blemish, and it does not permit the slaughter of the firstborn.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the mishna is referring to <b>the double teeth, what are the double teeth?</b> The area <b>from the double teeth and inward, and the double teeth themselves, are</b> considered <b>like the inward</b> part, i.e., the location of a concealed blemish, for which one may not slaughter the animal. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefutzai says: One slaughters</b> the firstborn <b>only for</b> a blemish of <b>the outer</b> teeth <b>alone. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: One does not consider the double teeth at all.</b>",
    "The Gemara notes that the <i>baraita</i> asks about the double teeth but does not answer the question: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying? And furthermore,</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefutzai is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> as they both maintain that a blemish to the double teeth is considered a concealed blemish.",
    "The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: What</b> are <b>the inner</b> gums, for which a firstborn is not slaughtered if a blemish was found there? The inner gums are located <b>from</b> the place of <b>the double teeth and inward, and the double teeth themselves are</b> considered <b>like the inward</b> part. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one does not slaughter the animal, <b>said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the inner gums <b>were damaged or were scratched. But</b> if <b>they were extracted, one does slaughter</b> the firstborn for this blemish.",
    "The Gemara continues its interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Kefutzai says: One slaughters</b> the firstborn <b>only for</b> a blemish of <b>the outer</b> teeth. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>inner</b> gums <b>that were extracted, one does not slaughter</b> the animal <b>for them, but it is disqualified</b> as an offering. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says: One does not pay attention to the double teeth at all, and</b> a blemish there <b>does not even disqualify</b> the firstborn from sacrifice.",
    "§ <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami raises a dilemma:</b> Is <b>there</b> halakhic significance to <b>the lack of a limb</b> that is <b>internal, or is there no</b> halakhic significance to <b>the lack of a limb</b> that is <b>internal?</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>With regard to what</b> issue did he raise this dilemma? <b>If</b> it was <b>with regard to</b> whether such a blemish renders permitted the slaughter of <b>a firstborn</b> outside the Temple, <b>it is written: “Lameness or blindness”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:21), which indicates that the blemish must be exposed.",
    "<b>If</b> the dilemma was raised <b>with regard to</b> whether other <b>sacrificial</b> animals with such a blemish are thereby disqualified from being sacrificed and may be redeemed, <b>it is written: “Blind or broken”</b> (Leviticus 22:22), which are also types of exposed blemishes. The Gemara explains that <b>we do not raise</b> this <b>dilemma with regard to slaughtering</b> the firstborn <b>or redeeming</b> other sacrificial animals, as it is clearly not considered a blemish to that extent. Rather, <b>we raise the dilemma with regard to disqualifying</b> the animal from sacrifice. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?",
    "The Gemara clarifies the dilemma. <b>The Merciful One states: “It shall be complete to be accepted”</b> (Leviticus 22:21), which indicates that <b>a complete</b> animal, <b>yes,</b> is fit as a sacrifice, but if it is <b>lacking</b> in any manner, even on the inside, it is <b>not</b> fit. <b>Or perhaps</b> one should interpret this phrase: <b>“It shall be complete to be accepted,”</b> in light of what is stated immediately afterward: <b>“There shall be no blemish therein.” Just as a blemish is on the outside,</b> as taught by the next verse, which says: “Blind or broken,” <b>so too,</b> the status of <b>lacking</b> a limb applies only if it is lacking <b>on the outside.</b>",
    "The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that this matter is subject to a dispute. It is taught in one <i>baraita</i>: When it states with regard to the burning of the sacrificial portions of a peace offering: <b>“And the two kidneys”</b> (Leviticus 3:4), this teaches that one sacrifices only an animal that has two kidneys, <b>but not</b> an animal that <b>has one kidney, nor</b> one that <b>has three kidneys. And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that when that verse states: “And the two kidneys…<b>he shall take it away,”</b> the singular form serves <b>to include</b> an animal that <b>has one kidney,</b> which may be sacrificed. Evidently, these <i>tanna’im</i> disagree as to whether an animal lacking a kidney is fit to be sacrificed.",
    "The Sages initially <b>assumed that everyone</b> agrees that there is <b>no entity</b> born <b>with one</b> kidney, and only one kidney is found <b>because</b> this offering <b>became lacking</b> a kidney only after birth. If so, <b>let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>a lack</b> of <b>an internal</b> limb <b>is considered a lack, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>a lack</b> of <b>an internal</b> limb <b>is not considered a lack.</b>",
    "<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> There is no dispute here, <b>as everyone agrees</b> that <b>there is</b> such <b>an entity</b> born <b>with one</b> kidney, <b>and</b> everyone also agrees that the <b>lack of an internal</b> limb <b>is considered a lack</b> that disqualifies the animal. <b>And</b> the contradiction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>where it was created with two</b> kidneys <b>and</b> one <b>is lacking,</b> the animal is disqualified. Whereas <b>there, where it was created with one</b> kidney <b>from the outset,</b> it is not lacking and therefore it is fit.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the first <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of an animal that has one kidney as <b>similar</b> to that <b>of</b> an animal that <b>has three kidneys.</b> One can therefore infer: <b>Just as</b> these <b>three</b> kidneys were present <b>from the outset,</b> as an animal does not grow new limbs, <b>so too,</b> the animal with <b>one</b> kidney alone was like that <b>from the outset.</b>",
    "<b>Rather,</b> everyone agrees that a lack of an internal limb is considered a lack, and <b>here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the matter of whether <b>there is an entity</b> created with one kidney <b>from the outset.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is an entity</b> created <b>with one</b> kidney, and it may be assumed that this is such an animal, and it is not lacking a limb. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no entity</b> created <b>with one</b> kidney, and this animal is lacking a limb and is disqualified for sacrifice.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Everyone agrees</b> that there is <b>no entity</b> born <b>with one</b> kidney, <b>and</b> that <b>a lack of an internal</b> limb <b>is considered a lack, and</b> yet it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to a case <b>where it lacked</b> a kidney <b>before</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> Whereas <b>there,</b> the second <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where it lacked</b> a kidney only <b>after</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> and therefore it is fit. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if the animal lacked a kidney <b>after</b> its <b>slaughter</b> but <b>before</b> the <b>collection</b> of the blood in a vessel for sprinkling, <b>is it permitted</b> to sacrifice it?"
