    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists additional blemishes that disqualify a priest from performing the Temple service: One who has <b>breasts</b> so large that they <b>sag like</b> those <b>of a woman;</b> or if <b>one’s belly is swollen</b> and protrudes; or if <b>one’s navel protrudes;</b> or if one is <b>an epileptic, even</b> if he experiences seizures only <b>once in</b> a long <b>while;</b> or one <b>who is afflicted with a melancholy temper;</b> or <b>one whose scrotum is</b> unnaturally <b>long; or one whose penis is</b> unnaturally <b>long</b> is disqualified from performing the Temple service.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a <i>halakha</i> involving a swollen belly. <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, says</b> that Torah scholars <b>may urinate in public</b> and they need not be concerned with issues of modesty, because holding back from urinating causes bodily harm. <b>But they may not drink water in public,</b> as such conduct is unbefitting a Torah scholar. <b>And this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Torah scholars <b>may urinate in public, but they may not drink water in public. And there was an incident involving one who sought to urinate, and he did not urinate, and his belly was found to be swollen.</b>",
    "The Gemara relates: It <b>was necessary for Shmuel</b> to urinate <b>on the Shabbat</b> when everyone came to hear <i>halakhot</i> relating <b>to the</b> impending <b>Festival.</b> In order to afford him privacy, <b>they spread a sheet for him.</b> Shmuel then <b>came before his father,</b> who <b>said to him: I will give you four hundred dinars</b> if you will <b>go</b> and <b>retract</b> this <b>incident,</b> i.e., if you will state publicly that one may not hold back from urinating even at the expense of one’s privacy. Since <b>you</b> are an important man, <b>you can</b> have others spread a sheet around you. But with regard to one <b>who cannot</b> have others spread a sheet <b>for him, should he endanger</b> himself by seeking privacy? You must therefore teach that one should not hold back from urinating even in public.",
    "The Gemara further relates that it <b>was necessary</b> for <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi</b> to urinate while he was walking <b>on the beams</b> of <b>a bridge,</b> and therefore he <b>urinated. They said to him: Your mother-in-law is coming.</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said to them:</b> I would have done this even <b>in her ear.</b> Since holding back from urinating would place him in physical danger, he would not care that his mother-in-law was coming and might see him.",
    "The Gemara returns to the incident cited in the <i>baraita</i> involving one who held back from urinating and his belly became swollen: <b>And let me derive,</b> i.e., can it not be said, that his belly swelled <b>due to a leech</b> that entered his intestines? The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> his urine would thereafter <b>drip</b> and no longer flowed in a healthy manner. Evidently, his health problems resulted from damage to the urinary tract.",
    "Concerning this topic <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There are two orifices in a man. One</b> of them <b>expels urine and one</b> of them <b>expels semen, and there is only</b> a partition <b>about</b> the thickness of <b>a garlic peel between them. When a man needs</b> to urinate and withholds the urine, <b>if</b> his urinary duct and seminal duct <b>were punctured</b> such that <b>this</b> duct leads <b>into that</b> one, <b>he</b> will be <b>found</b> to be <b>barren,</b> as his urine will penetrate into his seminal duct.",
    "<b>Reish Lakish says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “There shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:14)? It means as follows: <b>When will there not be a barren</b> male <b>among you? At a time that</b> you act as <b>among your cattle,</b> i.e., you urinate when the need arises, without hesitation.",
    "<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says,</b> with regard to the same verse, that the phrase <b>“There shall not be male</b>…<b>barren among you”</b> means you will not be barren <b>of students,</b> as one who leaves behind no students is considered barren. The term <b>“or female barren”</b> indicates <b>that your prayers will not be barren,</b> i.e., unheard, <b>before the Omnipresent,</b> but will be heard by Him. And <b>when</b> will they be heard? <b>At a time when you place yourself</b> in prayer as <b>an animal,</b> with humility.",
    "The Gemara cites additional statements of the Sages with regard to urination. <b>Rav Pappa says: A person</b> should urinate in Babylonia only on the dust, as it absorbs the urine. He <b>should not urinate either on an earthenware vessel or on a hard place,</b> as the urine will not be absorbed and will eventually flow into the underwater rivers. <b>As Rav says: Those inclines of Babylonia return the water</b> through underground watercourses <b>to the Spring of Eitam</b> in Eretz Yisrael, from which water was taken to the Temple. Additionally, <b>Abaye says: A woman should not stand openly in front of a child</b> when she urinates. But if she urinates while turning <b>sideways, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>",
    "It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A mass</b> of feces <b>that is held back</b> without being discharged <b>causes a person</b> to suffer <b>from dropsy [<i>hidrokan</i>],</b> while <b>a stream</b> of urine <b>that is held back causes a person</b> to suffer <b>from jaundice. Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Ketina says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> If one’s <b>blood</b> levels <b>increase</b> due to not undergoing bloodletting often enough, then <b>boils</b> will <b>increase</b> on him as well. If one’s <b>semen</b> levels <b>increase</b> due to not engaging in sexual intercourse often enough, then <b>leprosy</b> will <b>increase</b> on him. If one’s <b>feces</b> levels <b>increase</b> due to not relieving himself enough, <b>dropsy</b> will <b>increase</b> in him. Finally, if one’s <b>urine</b> levels <b>increase</b> due to not relieving himself enough, then <b>jaundice</b> will <b>increase</b> as well.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that one <b>who is afflicted with a melancholy temper</b> is disqualified from performing the Temple service. The Gemara asks: <b>What is this</b> melancholy temper? <b>A <i>tanna</i></b> taught: <b>A fallen spirit,</b> i.e., the spirit of a demon, <b>has come upon him.</b>",
    "The mishna also teaches that <b>one whose scrotum is</b> unnaturally <b>long [<i>me’ushban</i>] and one whose penis is</b> unnaturally <b>long [<i>ba’al gever</i>]</b> are disqualified from performing the Temple service. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>meshuban</i></b> is one <b>with</b> exceedingly large <b>testicles, and a <i>ba’al gever</i></b> is one <b>with</b> an unnaturally long <b>penis.</b> Similarly, it is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>meshuban</i>, this is</b> synonymous with <b>the <i>kayyan</i>. The <i>garbetan</i>, this is</b> synonymous with <b>a <i>ba’al kik</i>. A <i>kayyan</i></b> is one with a condition <b>of the testicles,</b> while <b>a <i>garbeta</i></b> is one with a condition <b>of the penis.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is considered too long, which disqualifies the priest from performing the Temple service? <b>Rav Yehuda pointed</b> and said: <b>Until</b> the <b>knee. It is</b> likewise <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> If one’s penis reaches <b>until</b> his <b>knee</b> he is <b>disqualified</b> from performing the Temple service. But if it reaches until just <b>above</b> his <b>knee</b> he remains <b>fit. Some say</b> if his penis reaches <b>until</b> the <b>knee</b> he is <b>fit,</b> but if it passes <b>below the knee</b> he is <b>disqualified.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one has no testicles, or</b> if <b>he has only one testicle, that is</b> the <b><i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i> that is stated in the Torah</b> (see Leviticus 21:20) among the blemishes that disqualify a priest from Temple service. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> A <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i> is <b>anyone whose testicles were crushed. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is <b>anyone that</b> has <b>wind in his testicles,</b> i.e., they are swollen. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus says:</b> <i>Mero’aḥ ashekh</i> does not refer to the testicles; rather, the reference is to <b>anyone whose appearance [<i>marav</i>] is</b> especially <b>dark [<i>ḥashukhin</i>].</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains why the <i>tanna’im</i> interpret <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i> in different ways. It is <b>difficult for Rabbi Yishmael:</b> If <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i> is referring to one who lacks two testicles, then the Torah <b>should have</b> stated: <b><i>Ḥasar ashekh</i>,</b> lacking a testicle, rather than <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i>. Therefore, he <b>teaches</b> that it is referring to one <b>whose testicles were crushed.</b> This is <b>difficult for Rabbi Akiva:</b> If <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i> means one with crushed testicles, then the Torah <b>should have</b> stated: <b><i>Mimro’aḥ ashekh</i>,</b> crushed testicles, not <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i>. Therefore, he <b>teaches</b> that the Torah is referring to one <b>who</b> has <b>wind in his testicles.</b>",
    "This is <b>difficult for Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus:</b> If <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i> is referring to one with wind in his testicles, then the Torah <b>should have</b> stated: <b><i>Ruaḥ ashekh</i>,</b> wind in the testicles. Therefore, he <b>teaches</b> that the Torah is speaking of anyone <b>whose appearance is especially dark.</b> And how does he derive such an interpretation from the verse? <b>He holds</b> that the Sages <b>subtract and add and interpret homiletically.</b> Accordingly, the <i>ḥet</i> of <i>mero’aḥ</i> is removed along with the <i>alef</i> of <i>ashekh</i>. The <i>ḥet</i> is added to <i>ashekh</i> and the <i>alef</i> is added to <i>mero’aḥ</i>, and <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i> is rearranged to state: <i>Marav ḥashukhin</i>, his appearance is dark.",
    "The Gemara asks: But if so, <b>this is</b> identical to one whose skin is extremely <b>black,</b> and the mishna on 45b explicitly states that such a priest is disqualified from performing the Temple service. The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus</b> learns from the mishna only that a <i>mero’aḥ ashekh</i> is disqualified; he <b>does not teach</b> in that mishna the <i>halakha</i> that a person with extremely <b>black</b> skin is blemished.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists additional blemishes that disqualify a priest from performing the Temple service: One whose legs are crooked and bend inward, causing him to <b>knock his ankles or his knees</b> into each other as he walks,"
