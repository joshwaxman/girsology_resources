    "<b>But</b> each shekel consists of four dinars, and therefore sixty shekels <b>is</b> equivalent to <b>two hundred and forty</b> dinars, not a <i>maneh</i>, which is generally worth one hundred dinars. <b>Rather, learn from</b> this verse a number of matters: First, learn that the <b><i>maneh</i> of the Sanctuary</b> to which Ezekiel was referring <b>was a <i>maneh</i></b> that was <b>double</b> its standard value. Therefore, it was worth fifty shekels, which is equivalent to two hundred dinars.",
    "<b>And</b> furthermore, as Ezekiel stated that the <i>maneh</i> will be sixty dinars, not fifty, <b>learn from it</b> that a community may <b>increase measures, but they may not increase</b> them by <b>more than one-sixth. And learn from it</b> that <b>the one-sixth</b> is calculated <b>from the outside,</b> i.e., it is one-sixth of the final sum, which is one-fifth of the previous sum. Therefore, adding one-fifth of the original fifty shekels, which is ten shekels, to the total equals sixty shekels. It is from this sum that the one-sixth from the outside, ten shekels, is calculated.",
    "§ The Gemara returns to discussing the redemption of firstborn donkeys: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: I asked Rabbi Eliezer in the great study hall:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>are firstborn donkeys different from firstborn horses and camels,</b> i.e., other non-kosher animals, which are not redeemed? Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to me:</b> It <b>is a Torah edict. And furthermore,</b> donkeys <b>assisted the Jewish people at the time of their exodus from Egypt, as there was not one</b> member <b>of the Jewish people that did not have ninety Nubian donkeys with him,</b> which were considered to be of superior quality, <b>laden with the silver and gold of the Egyptians.</b>",
    "Rabbi Ḥanina continues: <b>And furthermore, I</b> also <b>asked</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>the term: “Rephidim,”</b> in the verse: “Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim” (Exodus 17:8)? <b>And he said to me</b> that <b>Rephidim</b> was <b>its name,</b> i.e., of the location. The Gemara comments that this answer is <b>like</b> one side of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>its</b> actual <b>name</b> was <b>Rephidim. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This moniker is an allusion to the fact <b>that</b> the Jewish people <b>became lax [<i>rippu</i>] with regard to the statements of the Torah</b> in Rephidim, <b>and so it says: “The fathers look not back to their children because of feebleness [<i>rifyon</i>] of hands”</b> (Jeremiah 47:3).",
    "<b>And furthermore, I</b> also <b>asked him</b> the following question: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>the term “Shittim”</b> in the verse: “And Israel dwelled in Shittim” (Numbers 25:1)? <b>And he said to me</b> that <b>Shittim</b> was <b>its name.</b> The Gemara comments that this answer is <b>like</b> one side of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: Shittim</b> is <b>the</b> actual <b>name of</b> the place. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> This moniker is an allusion to the fact <b>that they were engaged in matters of nonsense [<i>shetut</i>],</b> i.e., prostitution and idol worship (see Numbers, chapter 25).",
    "The same <i>tanna’im</i> also dispute the meaning of another verse discussing that incident. With regard to the verse: <b>“And they called [<i>vatikrena</i>] the people to the offerings of their gods”</b> (Numbers 25:2), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Naked women encountered them,</b> which is how they were convinced to engage in idol worship. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says that they all became those who experienced seminal emissions [<i>kerayyin</i>]</b> resulting from the lust they experienced.",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A cow that gave birth to a donkey of sorts and a donkey that gave birth to a horse of sorts are exempt from</b> their offspring being counted <b>a firstborn, as it is stated:</b> “And every <b>firstborn of a donkey</b> you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 13:13); “and the <b>firstborn of a donkey</b> you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 34:20). The Torah states this <i>halakha</i> <b>twice,</b> indicating that one is not obligated <b>unless</b> both <b>the birth mother is a donkey and the</b> animal <b>born is a donkey.</b>",
    "<b>And what</b> is the halakhic status of offspring that are unlike the mother animal <b>with regard to</b> their <b>consumption?</b> In the case of <b>a kosher animal that gave birth to a non-kosher animal of sorts,</b> its <b>consumption is permitted. And</b> in the case of <b>a non-kosher</b> animal <b>that gave birth to a kosher animal of sorts,</b> its <b>consumption is prohibited.</b> This is <b>because that which emerges from the non-kosher</b> animal <b>is non-kosher and that which emerges from the kosher</b> animal <b>is kosher.</b>",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the issue of a kosher animal that gave birth to a donkey of sorts and its firstborn status, the Gemara comments: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (16b): <b>A ewe that gave birth to a goat of sorts and a goat that gave birth to a ewe of sorts are exempt</b> from the mitzva of the <b>firstborn. And if</b> the offspring <b>has some of the characteristics</b> of its mother, it is <b>obligated,</b> i.e., subject to the obligations of firstborn status.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> they are derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a firstborn kosher animal: <b>“But the firstborn of an ox,</b> or the firstborn of a lamb, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem, they are holy” (Numbers 18:17). The word firstborn seems superfluous in this verse, as it is clear from the context that it is referring to a firstborn. Therefore, the phrase “the firstborn of an ox” is interpreted as teaching <b>that it must be an ox and its firstborn</b> must be <b>an ox</b> in order for firstborn status to apply. Likewise, the phrase <b>“the firstborn of a lamb”</b> teaches <b>that it must be a lamb and its firstborn a lamb,</b> and not another animal. Similarly, the phrase <b>“the firstborn of a goat”</b> teaches <b>that it must be a goat and its firstborn a goat.</b>",
    "One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if the offspring <b>has some of the characteristics</b> of the mother it should still be exempt, as it does not entirely resemble the mother. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “But,”</b> indicating that the Torah <b>makes a distinction</b> with regard to this principle, in that it does not apply when the offspring has some of the characteristics of the mother; and the offspring therefore does have firstborn status.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna here <b>cite</b> the verses <b>“firstborn,” “firstborn,”</b> from Exodus (13:13, 34:20), <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a cow</b> that gave birth to a donkey of sorts, as teaching that the offspring has no firstborn status? Why, then, does Rav Yehuda resort to interpreting a different verse?",
    "The Gemara answers that this interpretation was not suggested originally by Rav Yehuda; rather, <b>he says</b> it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> the phrase <b>“but the firstborn of an ox”</b> indicates that the offspring does not have firstborn status <b>unless it is an ox and its firstborn is an ox.</b> The phrase <b>“the firstborn of a lamb”</b> indicates that the offspring does not have firstborn status <b>unless it is a lamb and its firstborn is a lamb.</b> Likewise, the phrase <b>“or the firstborn of a goat”</b> indicates that the offspring does not have firstborn status <b>unless it is a goat and its firstborn is a goat.</b>",
    "One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if the offspring <b>has some of the characteristics</b> of the mother this principle that it must be entirely like the mother applies, and it does not have firstborn status. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “But,”</b> indicating that the Torah <b>makes a distinction</b> with regard to this principle, in that it does not apply when the offspring has some of the characteristics of the mother; and the offspring therefore does have firstborn status.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>do</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna and Rabbi Yosei HaGelili <b>disagree,</b> and therefore derive this <i>halakha</i> from different verses? The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>holds</b> that <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah that a firstborn donkey, which is subject <b>to sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value</b> in that a lamb is given to the priest to redeem it, does not have firstborn status unless it resembles its mother, <b>and the same is true with regard to</b> a kosher firstborn animal, which has <b>inherent sanctity</b> and is sacrificed on the altar.",
    "<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili <b>holds</b> that <b>the Merciful One revealed</b> that a kosher firstborn animal, which is subject <b>to inherent sanctity,</b> does not have firstborn status unless it resembles its mother, <b>and the same is true with regard to</b> a donkey, which has <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value, and he derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>inherent sanctity.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>what does he do with this</b> repetition of the word: <b>“Firstborn,” “firstborn,”</b> employed both with regard to an ox and with regard to a lamb and goat, from which Rabbi Yosei HaGelili derives this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: He <b>requires it to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of burning the sacrificial portions of the animal on the altar, which is mentioned in this verse: “And you shall make their fat burn” (Numbers 18:17), <b>in accordance with</b> the interpretation <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b>",
    "<b>As Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: Why were sacrificial portions stated with regard to a firstborn ox,</b> and the <b>sacrificial portions</b> are mentioned again <b>with regard to a firstborn lamb,</b> and the <b>sacrificial portions</b> are mentioned again <b>with regard to a firstborn goat?</b>",
    "It <b>is necessary, as had the Merciful One written</b> the <i>halakha</i> of burning the sacrificial portions on the altar only <b>with regard to a firstborn ox,</b> one might have said only an ox’s sacrificial portions are burned, <b>as</b> an ox offering <b>has more</b> wine <b>libations</b> than a lamb or a goat. Therefore, perhaps the additional obligation of burning the sacrificial portions applies only to an ox.",
    "Likewise, if this <i>halakha</i> had been written only with regard to <b>a lamb,</b> one might have thought only a lamb’s portions are burned, <b>as it has more</b> sacrificial portions than other animals because its <b>tail</b> is also included.",
    "Likewise, if it had been written only <b>with regard to a goat,</b> one might have thought the burning of the portions applies only in that case, <b>as it has an increased</b> applicability <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>an individual</b> guilty of <b>idol worship,</b> who brings a goat as a sin offering; unlike one who commits other sins unwittingly, for which a lamb may be brought.",
    "The Gemara challenges: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one</b> of these cases, i.e., an ox, lamb, or goat offering, evidently <b>cannot be derived from one</b> of the others. Why not <b>derive one</b> of them <b>from</b> the other <b>two?</b>",
    "The Gemara responds: <b>With regard to which</b> case <b>shall</b> the Torah <b>not write</b> this <i>halakha</i>? If <b>the Merciful One shall not write</b> it <b>with regard to an ox, and</b> one should <b>derive</b> it <b>from these</b> other cases, that derivation is not valid. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> offerings, i.e., a lamb and a goat? They are notable in <b>that they have an increased</b> applicability <b>with regard to the Paschal offering,</b> for which a lamb or a goat is suitable but not an ox.",
    "If the Merciful One <b>should not write</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a lamb, and</b> one should <b>derive</b> it <b>from these</b> cases of an ox and a goat, that derivation is not valid either. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> offerings, i.e., an ox and a goat? They are notable in <b>that they have an increased</b> applicability <b>with regard to</b> a case where the entire Jewish <b>community</b> is guilty of unwitting <b>idol worship,</b> as in such a case the community brings an ox as a burnt offering and a goat as a sin offering (see Numbers 15:24), but not a lamb.",
    "If <b>the Merciful One shall not write</b> the obligation to burn the sacrificial portions <b>with regard to a goat, and</b> one should <b>derive</b> it <b>from these</b> cases of an ox and a lamb, that derivation is not valid either. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> offerings, namely, an ox and a lamb? They are notable in <b>that they have an element of increase with regard to the altar,</b> as the libations for an ox are larger than those for a goat; and also the tail of a lamb, but not that of a goat, is a sacrificial portion. The Gemara concludes: <b>Therefore,</b> all three cases <b>are necessary.</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> interpret this verse as teaching that a firstborn must resemble its mother in order to have firstborn status? Isn’t the verse necessary to teach the <i>halakha</i> of burning the sacrificial portions upon the altar? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the verse teaches only that <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the verse write: But a firstborn ox, lamb, or goat. Why do I</b> need the word <b>“firstborn”</b> to be repeated with regard to a lamb, and the word <b>“firstborn”</b> to be repeated again with regard to a goat? <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> here that the mother is not subject to having its offspring counted as a firstborn <b>unless</b> it resembles its mother, e.g., the mother <b>is an ox and its firstborn is an ox?</b>",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, what does he do with this</b> phrase: <b>“Firstborn of a donkey,” “firstborn of a donkey,”</b> mentioned twice in Exodus, from which the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna derives that the offspring must resemble its mother in order to have firstborn status?",
    "The Gemara answers that <b>he requires</b> that phrase <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> that <b>since it is stated: “Yet you shall redeem the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of non-kosher animals you shall redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:15), <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even firstborn horses and camels</b> must be redeemed, as they too are non-kosher animals. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Firstborn of a donkey,”</b> which indicates <b>I said to you</b> that firstborn status applies to <b>a firstborn donkey, but not</b> to <b>firstborn horses or camels.</b>",
    "<b>And still I can say</b> that the phrase “firstborn of a donkey” merely indicates that <b>firstborn donkeys</b> alone are redeemed <b>by means of a lamb,</b> while <b>firstborn horses and camels</b> are redeemed <b>by means of any</b> other <b>item.</b>"
