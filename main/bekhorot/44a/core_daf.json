    "Rather, <b>even if he does not paint both of his eyes as one,</b> any priest with an abnormally sunken nose is considered a <i>ḥarum</i>.",
    "§ The mishna teaches that if both of one’s eyes are above or <b>both of his eyes</b> are <b>below,</b> he is disqualified from performing the Temple service. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it mentions a priest wherein <b>both of his eyes</b> are <b>above</b> or <b>both of his eyes</b> are <b>below? If we say</b> that the phrase: <b>Both of his eyes</b> are <b>above,</b> means <b>that he</b> constantly <b>gazes upward,</b> and the phrase: <b>Both of his eyes</b> are <b>below,</b> means <b>that</b> he constantly <b>gazes downward,</b> then the case where <b>one of his eyes</b> is <b>above and one of his eyes</b> is <b>below</b> must similarly mean <b>that he gazes</b> with <b>one of his eyes downward and one of his eyes upward.</b> But if so, <b>this is</b> identical to the next case in the mishna, that one <b>sees</b> both <b>the room</b> on the ground floor <b>and the upper story as one.</b>",
    "<b>Rather,</b> the phrase: <b>Both of his eyes</b> are <b>above,</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> his eyes <b>are situated above</b> their normal place, and the phrase: <b>Both of his eyes</b> are <b>below,</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> his eyes <b>are situated below</b> their normal place. Similarly, the case where <b>one of his eyes</b> is <b>above and one of his eyes</b> is <b>below</b> is <b>where one of his eyes is situated above and one of his eyes</b> is situated <b>below. And</b> the mishna adds that in a case where his eyes <b>are situated in their</b> proper <b>arrangement as well, but he sees the room</b> on the ground floor <b>and the upper story as one,</b> he too is considered blemished.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to blemishes that disqualify priests: “Or a cataract or a <i>tevallul</i> in his eye” (Leviticus 21:20). Since it is obvious that a cataract or a <i>tevallul</i> can occur only in one’s eyes, why does the verse state: In his eye? The term <b>“in his eye”</b> indicates that <b>any</b> blemish <b>that is in his eye</b> disqualifies him from performing the Temple service. <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated:</b> If <b>both of his eyes</b> are <b>below</b> or <b>both of his eyes</b> are <b>above,</b> or if <b>one of his eyes</b> is <b>above and one of his eyes</b> is <b>below,</b> or if <b>he sees the room and the upper story as one, or</b> if <b>when he speaks with his friend another</b> person <b>says: He is looking at me,</b> he is blemished and is disqualified from performing the Temple service.",
    "§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When it is stated that <b>a blind man [<i>iver</i>]</b> is disqualified from performing the Temple service (see Leviticus 21:18), this applies <b>whether</b> he is <b>blind in both of his eyes or blind in one of his eyes.</b> With regard to a priest who cannot see due to <b>pale spots</b> on the eye <b>or</b> due to <b>tears</b> streaming from the eye <b>that are constant, from where</b> is it derived that he is disqualified? <b>The</b> same <b>verse states: “A blind man [<i>ish iver</i>].”</b> The superfluous word “<i>ish</i>” serves to include these conditions as well.",
    "<b>Rava says: Why do I</b> need <b>the Merciful One to write</b> the terms <b>“man,” “blind,” “cataract,” “<i>tevallul</i>,”</b> and <b>“in his eye”</b> (Leviticus 21:18, 20)? All these <b>are necessary, as had the Merciful One written</b> only <b>“blind,”</b> then one might say that a blind person is disqualified <b>because</b> his eyes <b>are not in</b> their sockets <b>at all,</b> i.e., they were enucleated. <b>But</b> in the case of a priest with <b>pale spots</b> on the eye <b>or tears</b> streaming from the eye <b>that are constant, where</b> his eyes <b>are</b> still <b>in</b> their sockets but he cannot see, perhaps he is <b>not</b> considered blemished. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote “man”</b> to include these conditions as well.",
    "<b>And had the Merciful One written</b> only <b>“man,”</b> one might have thought that only total blindness disqualifies a priest, <b>because he cannot see at all. But</b> if his condition causes merely <b>impaired</b> vision, then he is <b>not</b> considered blemished. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote “cataract”</b> to include conditions of impaired vision as well. <b>And had the Merciful One written</b> only that a priest with <b>a cataract</b> is disqualified, it might have been thought that such a priest is disqualified <b>because</b> his vision is <b>impaired. But</b> if his vision is not impaired but his eyes are <b>mixed,</b> i.e., the black and white parts of his eyes are mixed together, then he is <b>not</b> disqualified. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote “<i>tevallul</i>.”</b>",
    "<b>And had the Merciful One written</b> only <b>“<i>tevallul</i>,”</b> one might say that this disqualifies a priest <b>because</b> his eyes are <b>mixed. But</b> the Torah does <b>not</b> disqualify a priest <b>due to a deviation</b> from normal appearance, e.g., especially large eyes, or eyes situated higher than normal. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote “in his eye.”</b>",
    "In summary, <b>Rava says: Therefore, all</b> blemishes of the eyes that disqualify a priest <b>on account of dimness,</b> i.e., blindness, <b>are derived from</b> the term <b>“man.”</b> All blemishes of the eyes that are related to vision <b>impairment</b> are derived <b>from “cataract.”</b> All blemishes that are related to parts of the eye being <b>intermingled</b> are derived <b>from “<i>tevallul</i>.”</b> Finally, the disqualification of <b>deviations</b> is derived <b>from “in his eye.”</b>",
    "§ The mishna teaches that those unable to <b>look at the sun [<i>sakhei shemesh</i>]</b> are disqualified from performing the Temple service. <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> that this is a reference to those who <b>hate the sun [<i>sanei shemesh</i>],</b> i.e., they are incapable of opening their eyes in sunlight. The mishna further states that <b>one whose eyes are different</b> is disqualified from performing the Temple service. In order to illustrate this blemish, <b>Rav Huna pointed</b> with his finger while saying: The term: Different eyes, is referring to an individual wherein <b>one</b> of his eyes is like <b>ours and one</b> of his eyes is like <b>theirs. And</b> since Rav Huna was pointing at Rav Yehuda, who had abnormal eyes, <b>Rav Yehuda took offense.</b>",
    "The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to Rav Huna’s interpretation of one whose eyes are different: When the Sages taught that <b>a <i>shekhavna</i></b> is disqualified from performing the Temple service, they were referring to one <b>whose eyebrows lie</b> flat [<b><i>shokhvim</i></b>] and cover his eyes. When they taught that <b>one whose eyes are different [<i>zagdum</i>]</b> is disqualified, they were referring to a case where <b>one</b> of his eyebrows is <b>black and one</b> is <b>white.</b> The Gemara responds: With regard to <b>any pair</b> of limbs <b>that are not identical to one another,</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>calls</b> them <b>different.</b>",
    "§ The mishna teaches that <b>one whose eyes tear constantly</b> is disqualified from performing the Temple service. The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that defines such an individual: <b>His eyes,</b> i.e., his eyelids, <b>droop</b> and can open only partially, <b>or</b> his eyes are <b>round;</b> his eyes <b>tear,</b> or tears <b>stream</b> from his eyes, or tears <b>flow</b> intensely from them.",
    "The Sages taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The <i>zadir</i>, and the <i>lupin</i>, and the <i>tamir</i></b> are disqualified from performing the Temple service. <b><i>Zadir</i></b> is a reference to one <b>whose eyes are strange. <i>Lupin</i></b> is a reference to one <b>with an abundance of eyelashes. <i>Tamir</i></b> is a reference <b>to one whose eyelashes are depleted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach these</b> cases together <b>with</b> full-fledged <b>blemishes? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One whose eyelashes have fallen out is disqualified</b> from performing the Temple service <b>due to the appearance</b> of a blemish? Clearly, this is not considered an actual blemish. The Gemara answers that it is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna is referring to a case <b>where the roots</b> of his eyelashes <b>remain,</b> whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the roots do not remain.</b>",
    "<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists additional blemishes that disqualify a priest from performing the Temple service: If a priest’s <b>eyes are large like those of a calf or small like those of a goose;</b> if <b>his body is</b> disproportionately <b>large</b> relative <b>to his limbs or</b> disproportionately <b>small</b> relative <b>to his limbs;</b> if <b>his nose is</b> disproportionately <b>large</b> relative <b>to his limbs or</b> disproportionately <b>small</b> relative <b>to his limbs,</b> he is disqualified. And <b>the <i>tzomem</i> and the <i>tzome’a</i></b> are also disqualified. <b>What is a <i>tzome’a</i>?</b> It is <b>anyone whose ears are small. And</b> what is <b>the <i>tzomem</i>?</b> It is <b>anyone whose ears are similar to a sponge.</b> If <b>his upper lip protrudes beyond the lower</b> lip or his <b>lower</b> lip <b>protrudes beyond the upper</b> lip, <b>that is a blemish. And one whose teeth fell out is disqualified due to the appearance</b> of a blemish.",
    "<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says: Moses, our teacher, was ten <i>ammot</i></b> tall, <b>as it is stated: “And he spread the tent over the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 40:19). <b>Who spread</b> the tent over the Tabernacle? <b>Moses, our teacher, spread it, and it is written</b> with regard to the height of the Tabernacle: <b>“Ten <i>ammot</i> shall be the length of a board”</b> (Exodus 26:16). Moses must have been at least as tall as the Tabernacle itself for him to have spread the tent over it.",
    "<b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said to Rav: If so, you have rendered Moses, our teacher, a blemished</b> person, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>one’s body is</b> disproportionately <b>large</b> relative <b>to his limbs or</b> disproportionately <b>small</b> relative <b>to his limbs,</b> then he is blemished. A typical person is no more than three arm-lengths [<i>ammot</i>] tall, and yet Moses was apparently ten times taller than the length of his own arm. Rav <b>said to him: Shimi,</b> when I said that Moses was ten <i>ammot</i> tall, I <b>said</b> so <b>in</b> reference to the <b>cubit [<i>amma</i>] of a board</b> used in the building of the Tabernacle. The limbs of Moses were proportional to the rest of his body, but he was indeed ten cubits tall.",
    "The mishna taught that if <b>one’s nose is</b> disproportionately <b>large</b> relative to his limbs or disproportionately small relative to his limbs, he is blemished. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The measure of disproportion is the size <b>of</b> one’s <b>small finger.</b>",
    "§ The mishna also taught that <b>the <i>tzomem</i> and the <i>tzome’a</i></b> are blemished. The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The <i>tzime’aḥ</i></b> is <b>also</b> disqualified from performing the Temple service. <b>The Sages did not know what a <i>tzime’aḥ</i></b> is. <b>They heard a certain Arab who was saying: Who wants a <i>tzime’aḥ</i>, and it was found</b> to be <b>a long-eared goat.</b>",
    "The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> of a <i>tzomem</i>, <i>tzome’a</i>, and <i>tzime’aḥ</i> with regard to animals. <b>Rav Ḥisda says: A female goat that has no horns and a female lamb that has horns are fit for</b> sacrificing <b>upon the altar,</b> i.e., they are not considered blemished, despite the fact that they differ from regular female goats and female lambs.",
    "The Gemara notes that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There are matters that</b> appear <b>like blemishes but they are not</b> truly <b>like blemishes, and</b> one may therefore <b>slaughter</b> sacrificial animals <b>on</b> account of <b>them in the Temple,</b> i.e., they are fit for sacrifice despite these blemishes; <b>but</b> if they are firstborn animals, they are <b>not</b> permitted for slaughter <b>in the</b> rest of the <b>country</b> on account of these blemishes, as the unique physical characteristics of these animals are not true blemishes. <b>And these are</b> the blemishes: <b>A female goat that has no horns, and a female lamb that has horns, and the <i>tzime’aḥ</i>, and the <i>tzomem</i>, and the <i>tzome’a</i>.</b>",
    "With regard to the horns of an animal, <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Ameimar says:</b> If <b>the horns</b> of an animal <b>were removed, and their bones,</b> i.e., the bones inside the horns, were removed <b>with them,</b> the animal <b>is unfit</b> for sacrifice. <b>But</b> even so, <b>one may not redeem</b> the animal <b>on account of</b> such blemishes, as they are not full-fledged blemishes. But if <b>the hooves were removed, and their bones,</b> i.e., the portion of the leg to which the hooves are attached, were removed <b>with them, they are unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>and they are</b> even <b>redeemed on account of</b> such blemishes, as they are full-fledged blemishes.",
    "Rav Ḥisda stated that the removal of a horn and its bone is not considered a full-fledged blemish that enables the animal to be redeemed. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the horns or the hooves</b> of an animal <b>were removed, and their</b> respective <b>bones</b> were removed <b>with them, they are unfit and they are redeemed on account of them.</b> The Gemara explains that it is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the bone <b>was</b> entirely <b>uprooted,</b> which is a full-fledged blemish on account of which the animal may be redeemed. <b>That</b> statement of Rav Ḥisda is referring to a case <b>where</b> the bones <b>were cut</b> but were not uprooted entirely.",
    "The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in a case <b>where</b> the bones of the animal <b>were cut,</b> is the animal even rendered <b>unfit? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 2:2): With regard to a red <b>heifer whose horns and hooves are black,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>one should cut</b> away the black parts so that the heifer remains entirely red. Evidently, cutting away the horns of the heifer does not inflict a blemish upon it. <b>Ze’eiri interpreted</b> the mishna as referring to cutting the horn specifically <b>from above the bone</b> inside it. In such a case, the heifer is not disqualified. Cutting the bone itself does disqualify the animal."
